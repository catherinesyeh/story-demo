LINE 1: The spirit of Chia Pao-yü visits the confines of the Great Void.
LINE 2: The Monitory Vision Fairy expounds, in ballads, the Dream of the Red
LINE 3: Chamber.
LINE 4: Having in the fourth Chapter explained, to some degree, the
LINE 5: circumstances attending the settlement of the mother and children of the
LINE 6: Hsüeh family in the Jung mansion, and other incidental matters, we will
LINE 7: now revert to Lin Tai-yü.
LINE 8: Ever since her arrival in the Jung mansion, dowager lady Chia showed her
LINE 9: the highest sympathy and affection, so that in everything connected with
LINE 10: sleeping, eating, rising and accommodation she was on the same footing
LINE 11: as Pao-yü; with the result that Ying Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and T'an Ch'un,
LINE 12: her three granddaughters, had after all to take a back seat. In fact,
LINE 13: the intimate and close friendliness and love which sprung up between the
LINE 14: two persons Pao-yü and Tai-yü, was, in the same degree, of an
LINE 15: exceptional kind, as compared with those existing between the others. By
LINE 16: daylight they were wont to walk together, and to sit together. At night,
LINE 17: they would desist together, and rest together. Really it was a case of
LINE 18: harmony in language and concord in ideas, of the consistency of varnish
LINE 19: or of glue, (a close friendship), when at this unexpected juncture there
LINE 20: came this girl, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai, who, though not very much older in
LINE 21: years (than the others), was, nevertheless, in manner so correct, and in
LINE 22: features so beautiful that the consensus of opinion was that Tai-yü
LINE 23: herself could not come up to her standard.
LINE 24: What is more, in her ways Pao-Ch'ai was so full of good tact, so
LINE 25: considerate and accommodating, so unlike Tai-yü, who was supercilious,
LINE 26: self-confident, and without any regard for the world below, that the
LINE 27: natural consequence was that she soon completely won the hearts of the
LINE 28: lower classes. Even the whole number of waiting-maids would also for the
LINE 29: most part, play and joke with Pao-ch'ai. Hence it was that Tai-yü
LINE 30: fostered, in her heart, considerable feelings of resentment, but of this
LINE 31: however Pao-ch'ai had not the least inkling.
LINE 32: Pao-yü was, likewise, in the prime of his boyhood, and was, besides, as
LINE 33: far as the bent of his natural disposition was concerned, in every
LINE 34: respect absurd and perverse; regarding his cousins, whether male or
LINE 35: female, one and all with one common sentiment, and without any
LINE 36: distinction whatever between the degrees of distant or close
LINE 37: relationship. Sitting and sleeping, as he now was under the same roof
LINE 38: with Tai-yü in dowager lady Chia's suite of rooms, he naturally became
LINE 39: comparatively more friendly with her than with his other cousins; and
LINE 40: this friendliness led to greater intimacy and this intimacy once
LINE 41: established, rendered unavoidable the occurrence of the blight of
LINE 42: harmony from unforeseen slight pretexts.
LINE 43: These two had had on this very day, for some unknown reason, words
LINE 44: between them more or less unfriendly, and Tai-yü was again sitting all
LINE 45: alone in her room, giving way to tears. Pao-yü was once more within
LINE 46: himself quite conscience-smitten for his ungraceful remarks, and coming
LINE 47: forward, he humbly made advances, until, at length, Tai-yü little by
LINE 48: little came round.
LINE 49: As the plum blossom, in the eastern part of the garden of the Ning
LINE 50: mansion, was in full bloom, Chia Chen's spouse, Mrs. Yu, made
LINE 51: preparations for a collation, (purposing) to send invitations to dowager
LINE 52: lady Chia, mesdames Hsing, and Wang, and the other members of the
LINE 53: family, to come and admire the flowers; and when the day arrived the
LINE 54: first thing she did was to take Chia Jung and his wife, the two of them,
LINE 55: and come and ask them round in person. Dowager lady Chia and the other
LINE 56: inmates crossed over after their early meal; and they at once promenaded
LINE 57: the Hui Fang (Concentrated Fragrance) Garden. First tea was served, and
LINE 58: next wine; but the entertainment was no more than a family banquet of
LINE 59: the kindred of the two mansions of Ning and Jung, so that there was a
LINE 60: total lack of any novel or original recreation that could be put on
LINE 61: record.
LINE 62: After a little time, Pao-yü felt tired and languid and inclined for his
LINE 63: midday siesta. "Take good care," dowager lady Chia enjoined some of
LINE 64: them, "and stay with him, while he rests for a while, when he can come
LINE 65: back;" whereupon Chia Jung's wife, Mrs. Ch'in, smiled and said with
LINE 66: eagerness: "We got ready in here a room for uncle Pao, so let your
LINE 67: venerable ladyship set your mind at ease. Just hand him over to my
LINE 68: charge, and he will be quite safe. Mothers and sisters," she continued,
LINE 69: addressing herself to Pao-yü's nurses and waiting maids, "invite uncle
LINE 70: Pao to follow me in here."
LINE 71: Dowager lady Chia had always been aware of the fact that Mrs. Ch'in was
LINE 72: a most trustworthy person, naturally courteous and scrupulous, and in
LINE 73: every action likewise so benign and gentle; indeed the most estimable
LINE 74: among the whole number of her great grandsons' wives, so that when she
LINE 75: saw her about to go and attend to Pao-yü, she felt that, for a
LINE 76: certainty, everything would be well.
LINE 77: Mrs. Ch'in, there and then, led away a company of attendants, and came
LINE 78: into the rooms inside the drawing room. Pao-yü, upon raising his head,
LINE 79: and catching sight of a picture hung on the upper wall, representing a
LINE 80: human figure, in perfect style, the subject of which was a portrait of
LINE 81: Yen Li, speedily felt his heart sink within him.
LINE 82: There was also a pair of scrolls, the text of which was:
LINE 83: A thorough insight into worldly matters arises from knowledge;
LINE 84: A clear perception of human nature emanates from literary lore.
LINE 85: On perusal of these two sentences, albeit the room was sumptuous and
LINE 86: beautifully laid out, he would on no account remain in it. "Let us go at
LINE 87: once," he hastened to observe, "let us go at once."
LINE 88: Mrs. Ch'in upon hearing his objections smiled. "If this," she said, "is
LINE 89: really not nice, where are you going? if you won't remain here, well
LINE 90: then come into my room."
LINE 91: Pao-yü nodded his head and gave a faint grin.
LINE 92: "Where do you find the propriety," a nurse thereupon interposed, "of an
LINE 93: uncle going to sleep in the room of a nephew's wife?"
LINE 94: "Ai ya!" exclaimed Mrs. Ch'in laughing, "I don't mind whether he gets
LINE 95: angry or not (at what I say); but how old can he be as to reverentially
LINE 96: shun all these things? Why my brother was with me here last month;
LINE 97: didn't you see him? he's, true enough, of the same age as uncle Pao, but
LINE 98: were the two of them to stand side by side, I suspect that he would be
LINE 99: much higher in stature."
LINE 100: "How is it," asked Pao-yü, "that I didn't see him? Bring him along and
LINE 101: let me have a look at him!"
LINE 102: "He's separated," they all ventured as they laughed, "by a distance of
LINE 103: twenty or thirty li, and how can he be brought along? but you'll see him
LINE 104: some day."
LINE 105: As they were talking, they reached the interior of Mrs. Ch'in's
LINE 106: apartments. As soon as they got in, a very faint puff of sweet fragrance
LINE 107: was wafted into their nostrils. Pao-yü readily felt his eyes itch and
LINE 108: his bones grow weak. "What a fine smell!" he exclaimed several
LINE 109: consecutive times.
LINE 110: Upon entering the apartments, and gazing at the partition wall, he saw a
LINE 111: picture the handiwork of T'ang Po-hu, consisting of Begonias drooping in
LINE 112: the spring time; on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls,
LINE 113: written by Ch'in Tai-hsü, a Literary Chancellor of the Sung era, running
LINE 114: as follows:
LINE 115: A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man, because the spring
LINE 116: is cold.
LINE 117: The fragrant whiff, which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume
LINE 118: of wine!
LINE 119: On the table was a mirror, one which had been placed, in days of yore,
LINE 120: in the Mirror Palace of the Emperor Wu Tse-t'ien. On one side stood a
LINE 121: gold platter, in which Fei Yen, who lived in the Ch'ao state, used to
LINE 122: stand and dance. In this platter, was laid a quince, which An Lu-shan
LINE 123: had flung at the Empress T'ai Chen, inflicting a wound on her breast. In
LINE 124: the upper part of the room, stood a divan ornamented with gems, on which
LINE 125: the Emperor's daughter, Shou Ch'ang, was wont to sleep, in the Han Chang
LINE 126: Palace Hanging, were curtains embroidered with strings of pearls, by
LINE 127: T'ung Ch'ang, the Imperial Princess.
LINE 128: "It's nice in here, it's nice in here," exclaimed Pao-yü with a chuckle.
LINE 129: "This room of mine," observed Mrs. Ch'in smilingly, "is I think, good
LINE 130: enough for even spirits to live in!" and, as she uttered these words,
LINE 131: she with her own hands, opened a gauze coverlet, which had been washed
LINE 132: by Hsi Shih, and removed a bridal pillow, which had been held in the
LINE 133: arms of Hung Niang. Instantly, the nurses attended to Pao-yü, until he
LINE 134: had laid down comfortably; when they quietly dispersed, leaving only the
LINE 135: four waiting maids: Hsi Jen, Ch'iu Wen, Ch'ing Wen and She Yueh to keep
LINE 136: him company.
LINE 137: "Mind be careful, as you sit under the eaves," Mrs. Ch'in recommended
LINE 138: the young waiting maids, "that the cats do not start a fight!"
LINE 139: Pao-yü then closed his eyes, and, little by little, became drowsy, and
LINE 140: fell asleep.
LINE 141: It seemed to him just as if Mrs. Ch'in was walking ahead of him.
LINE 142: Forthwith, with listless and unsettled step, he followed Mrs. Ch'in to
LINE 143: some spot or other, where he saw carnation-like railings, jade-like
LINE 144: steps, verdant trees and limpid pools--a spot where actually no trace of
LINE 145: any human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dust
LINE 146: little had penetrated.
LINE 147: Pao-yü felt, in his dream, quite delighted. "This place," he mused, "is
LINE 148: pleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though I
LINE 149: may have to lose my home, I'm quite ready for the sacrifice, for it's
LINE 150: far better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father,
LINE 151: mother, and teacher."
LINE 152: While he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice of
LINE 153: some human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song:
LINE 154: Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream;
LINE 155: The transient flowers pass like a running stream;
LINE 156: Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind;
LINE 157: In useless grief what profit will ye find?
LINE 158: Pao-yü perceived that the voice was that of a girl. The song was barely
LINE 159: at an end, when he soon espied in the opposite direction, a beautiful
LINE 160: girl advancing with majestic and elastic step; a girl quite unlike any
LINE 161: ordinary mortal being. There is this poem, which gives an adequate
LINE 162: description of her:
LINE 163: Lo she just quits the willow bank; and sudden now she issues from the
LINE 164: flower-bedecked house;
LINE 165: As onward alone she speeds, she startles the birds perched in the
LINE 166: trees, by the pavilion; to which as she draws nigh, her shadow
LINE 167: flits by the verandah!
LINE 168: Her fairy clothes now flutter in the wind! a fragrant perfume like
LINE 169: unto musk or olea is wafted in the air; Her apparel lotus-like is
LINE 170: sudden wont to move; and the jingle of her ornaments strikes the
LINE 171: ear.
LINE 172: Her dimpled cheeks resemble, as they smile, a vernal peach; her
LINE 173: kingfisher coiffure is like a cumulus of clouds; her lips part
LINE 174: cherry-like; her pomegranate-like teeth conceal a fragrant
LINE 175: breath.
LINE 176: Her slender waist, so beauteous to look at, is like the skipping snow
LINE 177: wafted by a gust of wind; the sheen of her pearls and kingfisher
LINE 178: trinkets abounds with splendour, green as the feathers of a duck,
LINE 179: and yellow as the plumes of a goose;
LINE 180: Now she issues to view, and now is hidden among the flowers; beautiful
LINE 181: she is when displeased, beautiful when in high spirits; with
LINE 182: lissome step, she treads along the pond, as if she soars on wings
LINE 183: or sways in the air.
LINE 184: Her eyebrows are crescent moons, and knit under her smiles; she
LINE 185: speaks, and yet she seems no word to utter; her lotus-like feet
LINE 186: with ease pursue their course; she stops, and yet she seems still
LINE 187: to be in motion; the charms of her figure all vie with ice in
LINE 188: purity, and in splendour with precious gems; Lovely is her
LINE 189: brilliant attire, so full of grandeur and refined grace.
LINE 190: Loveable her countenance, as if moulded from some fragrant substance,
LINE 191: or carved from white jade; elegant is her person, like a phoenix,
LINE 192: dignified like a dragon soaring high.
LINE 193: What is her chastity like? Like a white plum in spring with snow
LINE 194: nestling in its broken skin; Her purity? Like autumn orchids
LINE 195: bedecked with dewdrops.
LINE 196: Her modesty? Like a fir-tree growing in a barren plain; Her
LINE 197: comeliness? Like russet clouds reflected in a limpid pool.
LINE 198: Her gracefulness? Like a dragon in motion wriggling in a stream;
LINE 199: Her refinement? Like the rays of the moon shooting on to a cool
LINE 200: river.
LINE 201: Sure is she to put Hsi Tzu to shame! Bound to put Wang Ch'iang to the
LINE 202: blush! What a remarkable person! Where was she born? and whence
LINE 203: does she come?
LINE 204: One thing is true that in Fairy-land there is no second like her! that
LINE 205: in the Purple Courts of Heaven there is no one fit to be her peer!
LINE 206: Forsooth, who can it be, so surpassingly beautiful!
LINE 207: Pao-yü, upon realising that she was a fairy, was much elated; and with
LINE 208: eagerness advanced and made a bow.
LINE 209: "My divine sister," he ventured, as he put on a smile. "I don't know
LINE 210: whence you come, and whither you are going. Nor have I any idea what
LINE 211: this place is, but I make bold to entreat that you would take my hand
LINE 212: and lead me on."
LINE 213: "My abode," replied the Fairy, "is above the Heavens of Divested
LINE 214: Animosities, and in the ocean of Discharged Sorrows. I'm the Fairy of
LINE 215: Monitory Vision, of the cave of Drooping Fragrance, in the mount of
LINE 216: Emitted Spring, within the confines of the Great Void. I preside over
LINE 217: the voluptuous affections and sensual debts among the mortal race, and
LINE 218: supervise in the dusty world, the envies of women and the lusts of man.
LINE 219: It's because I've recently come to hear that the retribution for
LINE 220: voluptuousness extends up to this place, that I betake myself here in
LINE 221: order to find suitable opportunities of disseminating mutual affections.
LINE 222: My encounter with you now is also not a matter of accident! This spot is
LINE 223: not distant from my confines. I have nothing much there besides a cup of
LINE 224: the tender buds of tea plucked by my own hands, and a pitcher of
LINE 225: luscious wine, fermented by me as well as several spritelike singing and
LINE 226: dancing maidens of great proficiency, and twelve ballads of spiritual
LINE 227: song, recently completed, on the Dream of the Red Chamber; but won't you
LINE 228: come along with me for a stroll?"
LINE 229: Pao-yü, at this proposal, felt elated to such an extraordinary degree
LINE 230: that he could skip from joy, and there and then discarding from his mind
LINE 231: all idea of where Mrs. Ch'in was, he readily followed the Fairy.
LINE 232: They reached some spot, where there was a stone tablet, put up in a
LINE 233: horizontal position, on which were visible the four large characters:
LINE 234: "The confines of the Great Void," on either side of which was one of a
LINE 235: pair of scrolls, with the two antithetical sentences:
LINE 236: When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false;
LINE 237: When naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught!
LINE 238: Past the Portal stood the door of a Palace, and horizontally, above this
LINE 239: door, were the four large characters: "The Sea of Retribution, the
LINE 240: Heaven of Love." There were also a pair of scrolls, with the inscription
LINE 241: in large characters:
LINE 242: Passion, alas! thick as the earth, and lofty as the skies, from ages
LINE 243: past to the present hath held incessant sway;
LINE 244: How pitiful your lot! ye lustful men and women envious, that your
LINE 245: voluptuous debts should be so hard to pay!
LINE 246: Pao-yü, after perusal, communed with his own heart. "Is it really so!"
LINE 247: he thought, "but I wonder what implies the passion from old till now,
LINE 248: and what are the voluptuous debts! Henceforward, I must enlighten
LINE 249: myself!"
LINE 250: Pao-yü was bent upon this train of thoughts when he unwittingly
LINE 251: attracted several evil spirits into his heart, and with speedy step he
LINE 252: followed in the track of the fairy, and entered two rows of doors when
LINE 253: he perceived that the Lateral Halls were, on both sides, full of tablets
LINE 254: and scrolls, the number of which he could not in one moment ascertain.
LINE 255: He however discriminated in numerous places the inscriptions: The Board
LINE 256: of Lustful Love; the Board of contracted grudges; The Board of Matutinal
LINE 257: sobs; the Board of nocturnal tears; the Board of vernal affections; and
LINE 258: the Board of autumnal anguish.
LINE 259: After he had perused these inscriptions, he felt impelled to turn round
LINE 260: and address the Fairy. "May I venture to trouble my Fairy," he said, "to
LINE 261: take me along for a turn into the interior of each of these Boards? May
LINE 262: I be allowed, I wonder, to do so?"
LINE 263: "Inside each of these Boards," explained the Fairy, "are accumulated the
LINE 264: registers with the records of all women of the whole world; of those who
LINE 265: have passed away, as well as of those who have not as yet come into it,
LINE 266: and you, with your mortal eyes and human body, could not possibly be
LINE 267: allowed to know anything in anticipation."
LINE 268: But would Pao-yü, upon hearing these words, submit to this decree? He
LINE 269: went on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairy
LINE 270: casting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed,
LINE 271: "Well, all right! you may go into this board and reap some transient
LINE 272: pleasure."
LINE 273: Pao-yü was indescribably joyous, and, as he raised his head, he
LINE 274: perceived that the text on the tablet consisted of the three characters:
LINE 275: the Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll with
LINE 276: the inscription:
LINE 277: Upon one's self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom;
LINE 278: A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?
LINE 279: Upon perusal of the scroll Pao-yü was, at once, the more stirred with
LINE 280: admiration; and, as he crossed the door, and reached the interior, the
LINE 281: only things that struck his eye were about ten large presses, the whole
LINE 282: number of which were sealed with paper slips; on every one of these
LINE 283: slips, he perceived that there were phrases peculiar to each province.
LINE 284: Pao-yü was in his mind merely bent upon discerning, from the rest, the
LINE 285: slip referring to his own native village, when he espied, on the other
LINE 286: side, a slip with the large characters: "the Principal Record of the
LINE 287: Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling."
LINE 288: "What is the meaning," therefore inquired Pao-yü, "of the Principal
LINE 289: Record of the Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling?"
LINE 290: "As this is the record," explained the Fairy, "of the most excellent and
LINE 291: prominent girls in your honourable province, it is, for this reason,
LINE 292: called the Principal Record."
LINE 293: "I've often heard people say," observed Pao-yü, "that Chin Ling is of
LINE 294: vast extent; and how can there only be twelve maidens in it! why, at
LINE 295: present, in our own family alone, there are more or less several
LINE 296: hundreds of young girls!"
LINE 297: The Fairy gave a faint smile. "Through there be," she rejoined, "so
LINE 298: large a number of girls in your honourable province, those only of any
LINE 299: note have been selected and entered in this record. The two presses, on
LINE 300: the two sides, contain those who are second best; while, for all who
LINE 301: remain, as they are of the ordinary run, there are, consequently, no
LINE 302: registers to make any entry of them in."
LINE 303: Pao-yü upon looking at the press below, perceived the inscription:
LINE 304: "Secondary Record of the twelve girls of Chin Ling;" while again in
LINE 305: another press was inscribed: "Supplementary Secondary Record of the
LINE 306: Twelve girls of Chin Ling." Forthwith stretching out his hand, Pao-yü
LINE 307: opened first the doors of the press, containing the "supplementary
LINE 308: secondary Record," extracted a volume of the registers, and opened it.
LINE 309: When he came to examine it, he saw on the front page a representation of
LINE 310: something, which, though bearing no resemblance to a human being,
LINE 311: presented, at the same time, no similitude to scenery; consisting simply
LINE 312: of huge blotches made with ink. The whole paper was full of nothing else
LINE 313: but black clouds and turbid mists, after which appeared the traces of a
LINE 314: few characters, explaining that--
LINE 315: A cloudless moon is rare forsooth to see,
LINE 316: And pretty clouds so soon scatter and flee!
LINE 317: Thy heart is deeper than the heavens are high,
LINE 318: Thy frame consists of base ignominy!
LINE 319: Thy looks and clever mind resentment will provoke,
LINE 320: And thine untimely death vile slander will evoke!
LINE 321: A loving noble youth in vain for love will yearn.
LINE 322: After reading these lines, Pao-yü looked below, where was pictured a
LINE 323: bouquet of fresh flowers and a bed covered with tattered matting. There
LINE 324: were also several distiches running as follows:
LINE 325: Thy self-esteem for kindly gentleness is but a fancy vain!
LINE 326: Thy charms that they can match the olea or orchid, but thoughts inane!
LINE 327: While an actor will, envious lot! with fortune's smiles be born,
LINE 328: A youth of noble birth will, strange to say, be luckless and forlorn.
LINE 329: Pao-yü perused these sentences, but could not unfold their meaning, so,
LINE 330: at once discarding this press, he went over and opened the door of the
LINE 331: press of the "Secondary Records" and took out a book, in which, on
LINE 332: examination, he found a representation of a twig of Olea fragrans.
LINE 333: Below, was a pond, the water of which was parched up and the mud dry,
LINE 334: the lotus flowers decayed, and even the roots dead. At the back were
LINE 335: these lines:
LINE 336: The lotus root and flower but one fragrance will give;
LINE 337: How deep alas! the wounds of thy life's span will be;
LINE 338: What time a desolate tree in two places will live,
LINE 339: Back to its native home the fragrant ghost will flee!
LINE 340: Pao-yü read these lines, but failed to understand what they meant. He
LINE 341: then went and fetched the "Principal Record," and set to looking it
LINE 342: over. He saw on the first page a picture of two rotten trees, while on
LINE 343: these trees was suspended a jade girdle. There was also a heap of snow,
LINE 344: and under this snow was a golden hair-pin. There were in addition these
LINE 345: four lines in verse:
LINE 346: Bitter thy cup will be, e'en were the virtue thine to stop the loom,
LINE 347: Thine though the gift the willow fluff to sing, pity who will thy
LINE 348: doom?
LINE 349: High in the trees doth hang the girdle of white jade,
LINE 350: And lo! among the snow the golden pin is laid!
LINE 351: To Pao-yü the meaning was again, though he read the lines over, quite
LINE 352: unintelligible. He was, about to make inquiries, but he felt convinced
LINE 353: that the Fairy would be both to divulge the decrees of Heaven; and
LINE 354: though intent upon discarding the book, he could not however tear
LINE 355: himself away from it. Forthwith, therefore, he prosecuted a further
LINE 356: perusal of what came next, when he caught sight of a picture of a bow.
LINE 357: On this bow hung a citron. There was also this ode:
LINE 358: Full twenty years right and wrong to expound will be thy fate!
LINE 359: What place pomegranate blossoms come in bloom will face the Palace
LINE 360: Gate!
LINE 361: The third portion of spring, of the first spring in beauty short will
LINE 362: fall!
LINE 363: When tiger meets with hare thou wilt return to sleep perennial.
LINE 364: Further on, was also a sketch of two persons flying a kite; a broad
LINE 365: expanse of sea, and a large vessel; while in this vessel was a girl, who
LINE 366: screened her face bedewed with tears. These four lines were likewise
LINE 367: visible:
LINE 368: Pure and bright will be thy gifts, thy purpose very high;
LINE 369: But born thou wilt be late in life and luck be passed by;
LINE 370: At the tomb feast thou wilt repine tearful along the stream,
LINE 371: East winds may blow, but home miles off will be, even in dream.
LINE 372: After this followed a picture of several streaks of fleeting clouds, and
LINE 373: of a creek whose waters were exhausted, with the text:
LINE 374: Riches and honours too what benefit are they?
LINE 375: In swaddling clothes thou'lt be when parents pass away;
LINE 376: The rays will slant, quick as the twinkle of an eye;
LINE 377: The Hsiang stream will recede, the Ch'u clouds onward fly!
LINE 378: Then came a picture of a beautiful gem, which had fallen into the mire,
LINE 379: with the verse:
LINE 380: Thine aim is chastity, but chaste thou wilt not be;
LINE 381: Abstraction is thy faith, but void thou may'st not see;
LINE 382: Thy precious, gemlike self will, pitiful to say,
LINE 383: Into the mundane mire collapse at length some day.
LINE 384: A rough sketch followed of a savage wolf, in pursuit of a beautiful
LINE 385: girl, trying to pounce upon her as he wished to devour her. This was the
LINE 386: burden of the distich:
LINE 387: Thy mate is like a savage wolf prowling among the hills;
LINE 388: His wish once gratified a haughty spirit his heart fills!
LINE 389: Though fair thy form like flowers or willows in the golden moon,
LINE 390: Upon the yellow beam to hang will shortly be its doom.
LINE 391: Below, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautiful
LINE 392: person, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat all
LINE 393: alone; with this inscription:
LINE 394: In light esteem thou hold'st the charms of the three springs for their
LINE 395: short-liv'd fate;
LINE 396: Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang'st, a Taoist dress
LINE 397: to don;
LINE 398: How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion,
LINE 399: Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for
LINE 400: mate.
LINE 401: Next in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, while
LINE 402: under it was this motto:
LINE 403: When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight;
LINE 404: The talents of this human form all know and living see,
LINE 405: For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be;
LINE 406: But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight.
LINE 407: This was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and a
LINE 408: dreary inn. A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were the
LINE 409: sentiments affixed below:
LINE 410: When riches will have flown will honours then avail?
LINE 411: When ruin breaks your home, e'en relatives will fail!
LINE 412: But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu,
LINE 413: A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.
LINE 414: Following these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side of
LINE 415: which, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle
LINE 416: (bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device:
LINE 417: What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum!
LINE 418: Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome!
LINE 419: With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be!
LINE 420: In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.
LINE 421: At the end of this poetical device, came the representation of a lofty
LINE 422: edifice, on which was a beauteous girl, suspending herself on a beam to
LINE 423: commit suicide; with this verse:
LINE 424: Love high as heav'n, love ocean-wide, thy lovely form will don;
LINE 425: What time love will encounter love, license must rise wanton;
LINE 426: Why hold that all impiety in Jung doth find its spring,
LINE 427: The source of trouble, verily, is centred most in Ning.
LINE 428: Pao-yü was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairy
LINE 429: perceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his natural
LINE 430: talents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven should
LINE 431: be divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself to
LINE 432: Pao-yü. "Come along with me," she said smiling, "and see some wonderful
LINE 433: scenery. What's the need of staying here and beating this gourd of
LINE 434: ennui?"
LINE 435: In a dazed state, Pao-yü listlessly discarded the record, and again
LINE 436: followed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, he
LINE 437: saw carnation portières, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars,
LINE 438: and carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of the
LINE 439: vermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnished
LINE 440: with gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatial
LINE 441: mansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and
LINE 442: fragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot was
LINE 443: indeed elysian.
LINE 444: He again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: "Come out all of
LINE 445: you at once and greet the honoured guest!"
LINE 446: These words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out of
LINE 447: the mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, and
LINE 448: their fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, and
LINE 449: as winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü,
LINE 450: they all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory Vision
LINE 451: Fairy. "Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be," they argued,
LINE 452: "we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you,
LINE 453: elder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time,
LINE 454: there would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sister
LINE 455: of Chiang Chu. That's the reason why we've been waiting for ever so
LINE 456: long; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object to
LINE 457: contaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?"
LINE 458: As soon as Pao-yü heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in such
LINE 459: a state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found it
LINE 460: impossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulness
LINE 461: and corruption of his own nature quite intolerable. The Monitory Vision
LINE 462: Fairy promptly took Pao-yü's hand in her own, and turning towards her
LINE 463: younger sisters, smiled and explained: "You, and all of you, are not
LINE 464: aware of the why and wherefore. To-day I did mean to have gone to the
LINE 465: Jung mansion to fetch Chiang Chu, but as I went by the Ning mansion, I
LINE 466: unexpectedly came across the ghosts of the two dukes of Jung and Ning,
LINE 467: who addressed me in this wise: 'Our family has, since the dynasty
LINE 468: established itself on the Throne, enjoyed merit and fame, which pervaded
LINE 469: many ages, and riches and honours transmitted from generation to
LINE 470: generation. One hundred years have already elapsed, but this good
LINE 471: fortune has now waned, and this propitious luck is exhausted; so much so
LINE 472: that they could not be retrieved! Our sons and grandsons may be many,
LINE 473: but there is no one among them who has the means to continue the family
LINE 474: estate, with the exception of our kindred grandson, Pao-yü alone, who,
LINE 475: though perverse in disposition and wayward by nature, is nevertheless
LINE 476: intelligent and quick-witted and qualified in a measure to give effect
LINE 477: to our hopes. But alas! the good fortune of our family is entirely
LINE 478: decayed, so that we fear there is no person to incite him to enter the
LINE 479: right way! Fortunately you worthy fairy come at an unexpected moment,
LINE 480: and we venture to trust that you will, above all things, warn him
LINE 481: against the foolish indulgence of inordinate desire, lascivious
LINE 482: affections and other such things, in the hope that he may, at your
LINE 483: instigation, be able to escape the snares of those girls who will allure
LINE 484: him with their blandishments, and to enter on the right track; and we
LINE 485: two brothers will be ever grateful.'
LINE 486: "On language such as this being addressed to me, my feelings of
LINE 487: commiseration naturally burst forth; and I brought him here, and bade
LINE 488: him, first of all, carefully peruse the records of the whole lives of
LINE 489: the maidens in his family, belonging to the three grades, the upper,
LINE 490: middle and lower, but as he has not yet fathomed the import, I have
LINE 491: consequently led him into this place to experience the vision of
LINE 492: drinking, eating, singing and licentious love, in the hope, there is no
LINE 493: saying, of his at length attaining that perception."
LINE 494: Having concluded these remarks, she led Pao-yü by the hand into the
LINE 495: apartment, where he felt a whiff of subtle fragrance, but what it was
LINE 496: that reached his nostrils he could not tell.
LINE 497: To Pao-yü's eager and incessant inquiries, the Fairy made reply with a
LINE 498: sardonic smile. "This perfume," she said, "is not to be found in the
LINE 499: world, and how could you discern what it is? This is made of the essence
LINE 500: of the first sprouts of rare herbs, growing on all hills of fame and
LINE 501: places of superior excellence, admixed with the oil of every species of
LINE 502: splendid shrubs in precious groves, and is called the marrow of
LINE 503: Conglomerated Fragrance."
LINE 504: At these words Pao-yü was, of course, full of no other feeling than
LINE 505: wonder.
LINE 506: The whole party advanced and took their seats, and a young maidservant
LINE 507: presented tea, which Pao-yü found of pure aroma, of excellent flavour
LINE 508: and of no ordinary kind. "What is the name of this tea?" he therefore
LINE 509: asked; upon which the Fairy explained. "This tea," she added,
LINE 510: "originates from the Hills of Emitted Spring and the Valley of Drooping
LINE 511: Fragrance, and is, besides, brewed in the night dew, found on spiritual
LINE 512: plants and divine leaves. The name of this tea is 'one thousand red in
LINE 513: one hole.'"
LINE 514: At these words Pao-yü nodded his head, and extolled its qualities.
LINE 515: Espying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaid
LINE 516: with gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to be
LINE 517: seen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight.
LINE 518: Below the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and a
LINE 519: toilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic;
LINE 520: while on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls,
LINE 521: with the inscription:
LINE 522: A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!
LINE 523: What help is there, but Heaven's will to brook?
LINE 524: Pao-yü having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, and
LINE 525: proceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One was
LINE 526: called the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another "the High Ruler of
LINE 527: Propagated Passion;" the name of one was "the Golden Maiden of
LINE 528: Perpetuated Sorrow;" of another the "Intelligent Maiden of Transmitted
LINE 529: Hatred." (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of one
LINE 530: and the same kind.
LINE 531: In a short while, young maid-servants came in and laid the table, put
LINE 532: the chairs in their places, and spread out wines and eatables. There
LINE 533: were actually crystal tankards overflowing with luscious wines, and
LINE 534: amber glasses full to the brim with pearly strong liquors. But still
LINE 535: less need is there to give any further details about the sumptuousness
LINE 536: of the refreshments.
LINE 537: Pao-yü found it difficult, on account of the unusual purity of the
LINE 538: bouquet of the wine, to again restrain himself from making inquiries
LINE 539: about it.
LINE 540: "This wine," observed the Monitory Dream Fairy, "is made of the twigs of
LINE 541: hundreds of flowers, and the juice of ten thousands of trees, with the
LINE 542: addition of must composed of unicorn marrow, and yeast prepared with
LINE 543: phoenix milk. Hence the name of 'Ten thousand Beauties in one Cup' was
LINE 544: given to it."
LINE 545: Pao-yü sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelve
LINE 546: dancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs they
LINE 547: were to sing.
LINE 548: "Take," suggested the Fairy, "the newly-composed Twelve Sections of the
LINE 549: Dream of the Red Chamber, and sing them."
LINE 550: The singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightly
LINE 551: clapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These were
LINE 552: the words which they were heard to sing:
LINE 553: At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the
LINE 554: earth chaos prevailed.
LINE 555: They had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: "This ballad
LINE 556: is unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is to
LINE 557: hand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars,
LINE 558: girls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which are
LINE 559: furthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces.
LINE 560: These fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person or
LINE 561: impressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readily
LINE 562: set to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who is
LINE 563: not cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained in
LINE 564: them. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with any
LINE 565: clearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to the
LINE 566: ballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax
LINE 567: (devoid of any zest)."
LINE 568: After these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a young
LINE 569: maid-servant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which
LINE 570: she handed to Pao-yü, who took it over; and as he followed the words
LINE 571: with his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song:
LINE 572: Preface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.--When the Heavens were opened
LINE 573: and earth was laid out chaos prevailed! What was the germ of love? It
LINE 574: arises entirely from the strength of licentious love.
LINE 575: What day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what time
LINE 576: I was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and with
LINE 577: this object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on the
LINE 578: subject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.
LINE 579: Waste of a whole Lifetime. All maintain that the match between gold and
LINE 580: jade will be happy. All I can think of is the solemn oath contracted in
LINE 581: days gone by by the plant and stone! Vain will I gaze upon the snow,
LINE 582: Hsüeh, [Pao-ch'ai], pure as crystal and lustrous like a gem of the
LINE 583: eminent priest living among the hills! Never will I forget the noiseless
LINE 584: Fairy Grove, Lin [Tai-yü], beyond the confines of the mortal world!
LINE 585: Alas! now only have I come to believe that human happiness is
LINE 586: incomplete; and that a couple may be bound by the ties of wedlock for
LINE 587: life, but that after all their hearts are not easy to lull into
LINE 588: contentment.
LINE 589: Vain knitting of the brows. The one is a spirit flower of Fairyland; the
LINE 590: other is a beautiful jade without a blemish. Do you maintain that their
LINE 591: union will not be remarkable? Why how then is it that he has come to
LINE 592: meet her again in this existence? If the union will you say, be strange,
LINE 593: how is it then that their love affair will be but empty words? The one
LINE 594: in her loneliness will give way to useless sighs. The other in vain will
LINE 595: yearn and crave. The one will be like the reflection of the moon in
LINE 596: water; the other like a flower reflected in a mirror. Consider, how many
LINE 597: drops of tears can there be in the eyes? and how could they continue to
LINE 598: drop from autumn to winter and from spring to flow till summer time?
LINE 599: But to come to Pao-yü. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse and
LINE 600: vague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintive
LINE 601: melody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spirit
LINE 602: and exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiries
LINE 603: about the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated,
LINE 604: but simply making these ballads the means for the time being of
LINE 605: dispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of what
LINE 606: came below.
LINE 607: Despicable Spirit of Death! You will be rejoicing that glory is at its
LINE 608: height when hateful death will come once again, and with eyes wide with
LINE 609: horror, you will discard all things, and dimly and softly the fragrant
LINE 610: spirit will waste and dissolve! You will yearn for native home, but
LINE 611: distant will be the way, and lofty the mountains. Hence it is that you
LINE 612: will betake yourself in search of father and mother, while they lie
LINE 613: under the influence of a dream, and hold discourse with them. "Your
LINE 614: child," you will say, "has already trodden the path of death! Oh my
LINE 615: parents, it behoves you to speedily retrace your steps and make good
LINE 616: your escape!"
LINE 617: Separated from Relatives. You will speed on a journey of three thousand
LINE 618: li at the mercy of wind and rain, and tear yourself from all your family
LINE 619: ties and your native home! Your fears will be lest anguish should do any
LINE 620: harm to your parents in their failing years! "Father and mother," you
LINE 621: will bid them, "do not think with any anxiety of your child. From ages
LINE 622: past poverty as well as success have both had a fixed destiny; and is it
LINE 623: likely that separation and reunion are not subject to predestination?
LINE 624: Though we may now be far apart in two different places, we must each of
LINE 625: us try and preserve good cheer. Your abject child has, it is true, gone
LINE 626: from home, but abstain from distressing yourselves on her account!"
LINE 627: Sorrow in the midst of Joy. While wrapped as yet in swaddling clothes,
LINE 628: father and mother, both alas! will depart, and dwell though you will in
LINE 629: that mass of gauze, who is there who will know how to spoil you with any
LINE 630: fond attention? Born you will be fortunately with ample moral courage,
LINE 631: and high-minded and boundless resources, for your parents will not have,
LINE 632: in the least, their child's secret feelings at heart! You will be like a
LINE 633: moon appearing to view when the rain holds up, shedding its rays upon
LINE 634: the Jade Hall; or a gentle breeze (wafting its breath upon it). Wedded
LINE 635: to a husband, fairy like fair and accomplished, you will enjoy a
LINE 636: happiness enduring as the earth and perennial as the Heavens! and you
LINE 637: will be the means of snapping asunder the bitter fate of your youth!
LINE 638: But, after all, the clouds will scatter in Kao T'ang and the waters of
LINE 639: the Hsiang river will get parched! This is the inevitable destiny of
LINE 640: dissolution and continuance which prevails in the mortal world, and what
LINE 641: need is there to indulge in useless grief?
LINE 642: Intolerable to the world. Your figure will be as winsome as an olea
LINE 643: fragrans; your talents as ample as those of a Fairy! You will by nature
LINE 644: be so haughty that of the whole human race few will be like you! You
LINE 645: will look upon a meat diet as one of dirt, and treat splendour as coarse
LINE 646: and loathsome! And yet you will not be aware that your high notions will
LINE 647: bring upon you the excessive hatred of man! You will be very eager in
LINE 648: your desire after chastity, but the human race will despise you! Alas,
LINE 649: you will wax old in that antique temple hall under a faint light, where
LINE 650: you will waste ungrateful for beauty, looks and freshness! But after all
LINE 651: you will still be worldly, corrupt and unmindful of your vows; just like
LINE 652: a spotless white jade you will be whose fate is to fall into the mire!
LINE 653: And what need will there be for the grandson of a prince or the son of a
LINE 654: duke to deplore that his will not be the good fortune (of winning your
LINE 655: affections)?
LINE 656: The Voluptuary. You will resemble a wolf in the mountains! a savage
LINE 657: beast devoid of all human feeling! Regardless in every way of the
LINE 658: obligations of days gone by, your sole pleasure will be in the
LINE 659: indulgence of haughtiness, extravagance, licentiousness and dissolute
LINE 660: habits! You will be inordinate in your conjugal affections, and look
LINE 661: down upon the beautiful charms of the child of a marquis, as if they
LINE 662: were cat-tail rush or willow; trampling upon the honourable daughter of
LINE 663: a ducal mansion, as if she were one of the common herd. Pitiful to say,
LINE 664: the fragrant spirit and beauteous ghost will in a year softly and gently
LINE 665: pass away!
LINE 666: The Perception that all things are transient like flowers. You will look
LINE 667: lightly upon the three springs and regard the blush of the peach and the
LINE 668: green of the willow as of no avail. You will beat out the fire of
LINE 669: splendour, and treat solitary retirement as genial! What is it that you
LINE 670: say about the delicate peaches in the heavens (marriage) being
LINE 671: excellent, and the petals of the almond in the clouds being plentiful
LINE 672: (children)? Let him who has after all seen one of them, (really a mortal
LINE 673: being) go safely through the autumn, (wade safely through old age),
LINE 674: behold the people in the white Poplar village groan and sigh; and the
LINE 675: spirits under the green maple whine and moan! Still more wide in expanse
LINE 676: than even the heavens is the dead vegetation which covers the graves!
LINE 677: The moral is this, that the burden of man is poverty one day and
LINE 678: affluence another; that bloom in spring, and decay in autumn, constitute
LINE 679: the doom of vegetable life! In the same way, this calamity of birth and
LINE 680: the visitation of death, who is able to escape? But I have heard it said
LINE 681: that there grows in the western quarter a tree called the P'o So
LINE 682: (Patient Bearing) which bears the fruit of Immortal life!
LINE 683: The bane of Intelligence. Yours will be the power to estimate, in a
LINE 684: thorough manner, the real motives of all things, as yours will be
LINE 685: intelligence of an excessive degree; but instead (of reaping any
LINE 686: benefit) you will cast the die of your own existence! The heart of your
LINE 687: previous life is already reduced to atoms, and when you shall have died,
LINE 688: your nature will have been intelligent to no purpose! Your home will be
LINE 689: in easy circumstances; your family will enjoy comforts; but your
LINE 690: connexions will, at length, fall a prey to death, and the inmates of
LINE 691: your family scatter, each one of you speeding in a different direction,
LINE 692: making room for others! In vain, you will have harassed your mind with
LINE 693: cankering thoughts for half a lifetime; for it will be just as if you
LINE 694: had gone through the confused mazes of a dream on the third watch!
LINE 695: Sudden a crash (will be heard) like the fall of a spacious palace, and a
LINE 696: dusky gloominess (will supervene) such as is caused by a lamp about to
LINE 697: spend itself! Alas! a spell of happiness will be suddenly (dispelled by)
LINE 698: adversity! Woe is man in the world! for his ultimate doom is difficult
LINE 699: to determine!
LINE 700: Leave behind a residue of happiness! Hand down an excess of happiness;
LINE 701: hand down an excess of happiness! Unexpectedly you will come across a
LINE 702: benefactor! Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother, will have
LINE 703: laid by a store of virtue and secret meritorious actions! My advice to
LINE 704: you, mankind, is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed! Do
LINE 705: not resemble those who will harp after lucre and show themselves
LINE 706: unmindful of the ties of relationship: that wolflike maternal uncle of
LINE 707: yours and that impostor of a brother! True it is that addition and
LINE 708: subtraction, increase and decrease, (reward and punishment,) rest in the
LINE 709: hands of Heaven above!
LINE 710: Splendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still more
LINE 711: ephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon!
LINE 712: Make no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; for
LINE 713: though you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, on
LINE 714: your person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will not
LINE 715: nevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)!
LINE 716: Though the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, the
LINE 717: burden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store of
LINE 718: benevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons and
LINE 719: grandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear on
LINE 720: his head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the gold
LINE 721: seal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and he
LINE 722: may rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary way
LINE 723: which leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who have
LINE 724: been from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in a
LINE 725: futile name handed down to posterity to reverence!
LINE 726: Death ensues when things propitious reign! Upon the ornamented beam will
LINE 727: settle at the close of spring the fragrant dust! Your reckless
LINE 728: indulgence of licentious love and your naturally moonlike face will soon
LINE 729: be the source of the ruin of a family. The decadence of the family
LINE 730: estate will emanate entirely from Ching; while the wane of the family
LINE 731: affairs will be entirely attributable to the fault of Ning! Licentious
LINE 732: love will be the main reason of the long-standing grudge.
LINE 733: The flying birds each perch upon the trees! The family estates of those
LINE 734: in official positions will fade! The gold and silver of the rich and
LINE 735: honoured will be scattered! those who will have conferred benefit will,
LINE 736: even in death, find the means of escape! those devoid of human feelings
LINE 737: will reap manifest retribution! Those indebted for a life will make, in
LINE 738: due time, payment with their lives; those indebted for tears have
LINE 739: already (gone) to exhaust their tears! Mutual injuries will be revenged
LINE 740: in no light manner! Separation and reunion will both alike be determined
LINE 741: by predestination! You wish to know why your life will be short; look
LINE 742: into your previous existence! Verily, riches and honours, which will
LINE 743: come with old age, will likewise be a question of chance! Those who will
LINE 744: hold the world in light esteem will retire within the gate of
LINE 745: abstraction; while those who will be allured by enticement will have
LINE 746: forfeited their lives (The Chia family will fulfil its destiny) as
LINE 747: surely as birds take to the trees after they have exhausted all they had
LINE 748: to eat, and which as they drop down will pile up a hoary, vast and lofty
LINE 749: heap of dust, (leaving) indeed a void behind!
LINE 750: When the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the
LINE 751: "Supplementary Record;" but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving the
LINE 752: total absence of any interest in Pao-yü, heaved a sigh. "You silly
LINE 753: brat!" she exclaimed. "What! haven't you, even now, attained
LINE 754: perception!"
LINE 755: "There's no need for you to go on singing," speedily observed Pao-yü, as
LINE 756: he interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, he
LINE 757: pleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to lie
LINE 758: down.
LINE 759: The Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, and
LINE 760: escorted Pao-yü to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour of
LINE 761: such objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hitherto
LINE 762: seen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight,
LINE 763: at an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshness
LINE 764: of her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance to
LINE 765: Pao-ch'ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, to
LINE 766: Tai-yu.
LINE 767: While he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenly
LINE 768: remarked: "All those female apartments and ladies' chambers in so many
LINE 769: wealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception,
LINE 770: polluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy of
LINE 771: profligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till now
LINE 772: numberless dissolute roués, one and all of whom maintain that libidinous
LINE 773: affections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to prove
LINE 774: that licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all these
LINE 775: arguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen for
LINE 776: their pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still more
LINE 777: does the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it is
LINE 778: that the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentious
LINE 779: affection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from a
LINE 780: hankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love,
LINE 781: are the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the
LINE 782: present time!"
LINE 783: Pao-yü was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, he
LINE 784: said by way of reply: "My Fairy labours under a misapprehension. Simply
LINE 785: because of my reluctance to read my books my parents have, on repeated
LINE 786: occasions, extended to me injunction and reprimand, and would I have the
LINE 787: courage to go so far as to rashly plunge in lewd habits? Besides, I am
LINE 788: still young in years, and have no notion what is implied by lewdness!"
LINE 789: "Not so!" exclaimed the Fairy; "lewdness, although one thing in
LINE 790: principle is, as far as meaning goes, subject to different
LINE 791: constructions; as is exemplified by those in the world whose heart is
LINE 792: set upon lewdness. Some delight solely in faces and figures; others find
LINE 793: insatiable pleasure in singing and dancing; some in dalliance and
LINE 794: raillery; others in the incessant indulgence of their lusts; and these
LINE 795: regret that all the beautiful maidens under the heavens cannot minister
LINE 796: to their short-lived pleasure. These several kinds of persons are foul
LINE 797: objects steeped skin and all in lewdness. The lustful love, for
LINE 798: instance, which has sprung to life and taken root in your natural
LINE 799: affections, I and such as myself extend to it the character of an
LINE 800: abstract lewdness; but abstract lewdness can be grasped by the mind, but
LINE 801: cannot be transmitted by the mouth; can be fathomed by the spirit, but
LINE 802: cannot be divulged in words. As you now are imbued with this desire only
LINE 803: in the abstract, you are certainly well fit to be a trustworthy friend
LINE 804: in (Fairyland) inner apartments, but, on the path of the mortal world,
LINE 805: you will inevitably be misconstrued and defamed; every mouth will
LINE 806: ridicule you; every eye will look down upon you with contempt. After
LINE 807: meeting recently your worthy ancestors, the two Dukes of Ning and Jung,
LINE 808: who opened their hearts and made their wishes known to me with such
LINE 809: fervour, (but I will not have you solely on account of the splendour of
LINE 810: our inner apartments look down despisingly upon the path of the world),
LINE 811: I consequently led you along, my son, and inebriated you with luscious
LINE 812: wines, steeped you in spiritual tea, and admonished you with excellent
LINE 813: songs, bringing also here a young sister of mine, whose infant name is
LINE 814: Chien Mei, and her style K'o Ching, to be given to you as your wedded
LINE 815: wife. To-night, the time will be propitious and suitable for the
LINE 816: immediate consummation of the union, with the express object of letting
LINE 817: you have a certain insight into the fact that if the condition of the
LINE 818: abode of spirits within the confines of Fairyland be still so
LINE 819: (imperfect), how much the more so should be the nature of the affections
LINE 820: which prevail in the dusty world; with the intent that from this time
LINE 821: forth you should positively break loose from bondage, perceive and amend
LINE 822: your former disposition, devote your attention to the works of Confucius
LINE 823: and Mencius, and set your steady purpose upon the principles of
LINE 824: morality."
LINE 825: Having ended these remarks, she initiated him into the mysteries of
LINE 826: licentious love, and, pushing Pao-yü into the room, she closed the door,
LINE 827: and took her departure all alone. Pao-yü in a dazed state complied with
LINE 828: the admonitions given him by the Fairy, and the natural result was, of
LINE 829: course, a violent flirtation, the circumstances of which it would be
LINE 830: impossible to recount.
LINE 831: When the next day came, he was by that time so attached to her by ties
LINE 832: of tender love and their conversation was so gentle and full of charm
LINE 833: that he could not brook to part from K'o Ching. Hand-in-hand, the two of
LINE 834: them therefore, went out for a stroll, when they unexpectedly reached a
LINE 835: place, where nothing else met their gaze than thorns and brambles, which
LINE 836: covered the ground, and a wolf and a tiger walking side by side. Before
LINE 837: them stretched the course of a black stream, which obstructed their
LINE 838: progress; and over this stream there was, what is more, no bridge to
LINE 839: enable one to cross it.
LINE 840: While they were exercising their minds with perplexity, they suddenly
LINE 841: espied the Fairy coming from the back in pursuit of them. "Desist at
LINE 842: once," she exclaimed, "from making any advance into the stream; it is
LINE 843: urgent that you should, with all speed, turn your faces round!"
LINE 844: Pao-yü lost no time in standing still. "What is this place?" he
LINE 845: inquired.
LINE 846: "This is the Ford of Enticement," explained the Fairy. "Its depth is ten
LINE 847: thousand chang; its breadth is a thousand li; in its stream there are no
LINE 848: boats or paddles by means of which to effect a passage. There is simply
LINE 849: a raft, of which Mu Chu-shih directs the rudder, and which Hui Shih chen
LINE 850: punts with the poles. They receive no compensation in the shape of gold
LINE 851: or silver, but when they come across any one whose destiny it is to
LINE 852: cross, they ferry him over. You now have by accident strolled as far as
LINE 853: here, and had you fallen into the stream you would have rendered quite
LINE 854: useless the advice and admonition which I previously gave you."
LINE 855: These words were scarcely concluded, when suddenly was heard from the
LINE 856: midst of the Ford of Enticement, a sound like unto a peal of thunder,
LINE 857: whereupon a whole crowd of gobblins and sea-urchins laid hands upon
LINE 858: Pao-yü and dragged him down.
LINE 859: This so filled Pao-yü with consternation that he fell into a
LINE 860: perspiration as profuse as rain, and he simultaneously broke forth and
LINE 861: shouted, "Rescue me, K'o Ching!"
LINE 862: These cries so terrified Hsi Jen and the other waiting-maids, that they
LINE 863: rushed forward, and taking Pao-yü in their arms, "Don't be afraid,
LINE 864: Pao-yü," they said, "we are here."
LINE 865: But we must observe that Mrs. Ch'in was just inside the apartment in the
LINE 866: act of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the cats
LINE 867: and dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-yü, in his
LINE 868: dream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she therefore
LINE 869: communed within herself, "As far as my infant name goes, there is, in
LINE 870: this establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is it
LINE 871: that he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?" And
LINE 872: she was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listen
LINE 873: to the explanations given in the chapter which follows.
