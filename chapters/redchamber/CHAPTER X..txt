LINE 1: Widow Chin, prompted by a desire to reap advantage, puts up
LINE 2: temporarily with an insult.
LINE 3: Dr. Chang in discussing Mrs. Chin's illness minutely exhausts its
LINE 4: origin.
LINE 5: We will now resume our story. As the persons against Chin Jung were so
LINE 6: many and their pressure so great, and as, what was more, Chia Jui urged
LINE 7: him to make amends, he had to knock his head on the ground before Ch'in
LINE 8: Chung. Pao-yü then gave up his clamorous remonstrances and the whole
LINE 9: crowd dispersed from school.
LINE 10: Chin Jung himself returned home all alone, but the more he pondered on
LINE 11: the occurrence, the more incensed he felt. "Ch'in Chung," he argued, "is
LINE 12: simply Chia Jung's young brother-in-law, and is no son or grandson of
LINE 13: the Chia family, and he too joins the class and prosecutes his studies
LINE 14: on no other footing than that of mine; but it's because he relies upon
LINE 15: Pao-yü's friendship for him that he has no eye for any one. This being
LINE 16: the case, he should be somewhat proper in his behaviour, and there would
LINE 17: be then not a word to say about it! He has besides all along been very
LINE 18: mystical with Pao-yü, imagining that we are all blind, and have no eyes
LINE 19: to see what's up! Here he goes again to-day and mixes with people in
LINE 20: illicit intrigues; and it's all because they happened to obtrude
LINE 21: themselves before my very eyes that this rumpus has broken out; but of
LINE 22: what need I fear?"
LINE 23: His mother, née Hu, hearing him mutter; "Why meddle again," she
LINE 24: explained, "in things that don't concern you? I had endless trouble in
LINE 25: getting to speak to your paternal aunt; and your aunt had, on the other
LINE 26: hand, a thousand and one ways and means to devise, before she could
LINE 27: appeal to lady Secunda, of the Western mansion; and then only it was
LINE 28: that you got this place to study in. Had we not others to depend upon
LINE 29: for your studies, would we have in our house the means sufficient to
LINE 30: engage a teacher? Besides, in other people's school, tea and eatables
LINE 31: are all ready and found; and these two years that you've been there for
LINE 32: your lessons, we've likewise effected at home a great saving in what
LINE 33: would otherwise have been necessary for your eating and use. Something
LINE 34: has been, it's true, economised; but you have further a liking for spick
LINE 35: and span clothes. Besides, it's only through your being there to study,
LINE 36: that you've come to know Mr. Hsüeh! that Mr. Hsüeh, who has even in one
LINE 37: year given us so much pecuniary assistance as seventy and eighty taels!
LINE 38: And now you would go and raise a row in this school-room! why, if we
LINE 39: were bent upon finding such another place, I tell you plainly, and once
LINE 40: for all, that we would find it more difficult than if we tried to scale
LINE 41: the heavens! Now do quietly play for a while, and then go to sleep, and
LINE 42: you'll be ever so much better for it then."
LINE 43: Chin Jung thereupon stifled his anger and held his tongue; and, after a
LINE 44: short while, he in fact went to sleep of his own accord.
LINE 45: The next day he again went to school, and no further comment need be
LINE 46: made about it; but we will go on to explain that a young lady related to
LINE 47: her had at one time been given in marriage to a descendant (of the
LINE 48: eldest branch) of the Chia family, (whose names were written) with the
LINE 49: jade radical, Chia Huang by name; but how could the whole number of
LINE 50: members of the clan equal in affluence and power the two mansions of
LINE 51: Ning and Jung? This fact goes, as a matter of course, without saying.
LINE 52: The Chia Huang couple enjoyed some small income; but they also went, on
LINE 53: frequent occasions, to the mansions of Ning and Jung to pay their
LINE 54: respects; and they knew likewise so well how to adulate lady Feng and
LINE 55: Mrs. Yu, that lady Feng and Mrs. Yu would often grant them that
LINE 56: assistance and support which afforded them the means of meeting their
LINE 57: daily expenses.
LINE 58: It just occurred on this occasion that the weather was clear and fine,
LINE 59: and that there happened, on the other hand, to be nothing to attend to
LINE 60: at home, so forthwith taking along with her a matron, (Mrs. Chia Huang)
LINE 61: got into a carriage and came over to see widow Chin and her nephew.
LINE 62: While engaged in a chat, Chin Jung's mother accidentally broached the
LINE 63: subject of the affair, which had transpired in the school-room of the
LINE 64: Chia mansion on the previous day, and she gave, for the benefit of her
LINE 65: young sister-in-law, a detailed account of the whole occurrence from
LINE 66: beginning to end.
LINE 67: This Mrs. Huang would not have had her temper ruffled had she not come
LINE 68: to hear what had happened; but having heard about it, anger sprung from
LINE 69: the very depths of her heart. "This fellow, Ch'in Chung," she exclaimed,
LINE 70: "is a relative of the Chia family, but is it likely that Jung Erh isn't,
LINE 71: in like manner, a relative of the Chia family; and when relatives are
LINE 72: many, there's no need to put on airs! Besides, does his conduct consist,
LINE 73: for the most part, of anything that would make one get any face? In
LINE 74: fact, Pao-yü himself shouldn't do injury to himself by condescending to
LINE 75: look at him. But, as things have come to this pass, give me time and
LINE 76: I'll go to the Eastern mansion and see our lady Chen and then have a
LINE 77: chat with Ch'in Chung's sister, and ask her to decide who's right and
LINE 78: who's wrong!"
LINE 79: Chin Jung's mother upon hearing these words was terribly distressed.
LINE 80: "It's all through my hasty tongue," she observed with vehemence, "that
LINE 81: I've told you all, sister-in-law: but please, sister, give up at once
LINE 82: the idea of going over to say anything about it! Don't trouble yourself
LINE 83: as to who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; for were any
LINE 84: unpleasantness to come out of it, how could we here stand on our legs?
LINE 85: and were we not to stand on our legs, not only would we never be able to
LINE 86: engage a tutor, but the result will be, on the contrary, that for his
LINE 87: own person will be superadded many an expense for eatables and
LINE 88: necessaries."
LINE 89: "What do I care about how many?" replied Mrs. Huang; "wait till I've
LINE 90: spoken about it, and we'll see what will be the result." Nor would she
LINE 91: accede to her sister-in-law's entreaties, but bidding, at the same time,
LINE 92: the matron look after the carriage, she got into it, and came over to
LINE 93: the Ning Mansion.
LINE 94: On her arrival at the Ning Mansion, she entered by the eastern side
LINE 95: gate, and dismounting from the carriage, she went in to call on Mrs. Yu,
LINE 96: the spouse of Chia Chen, with whom she had not the courage to put on any
LINE 97: high airs; but gently and quietly she made inquiries after her health,
LINE 98: and after passing some irrelevant remarks, she ascertained: "How is it I
LINE 99: don't see lady Jung to-day?"
LINE 100: "I don't know," replied Mrs. Yu, "what's the matter with her these last
LINE 101: few days; but she hasn't been herself for two months and more; and the
LINE 102: doctor who was asked to see her declares that it is nothing connected
LINE 103: with any happy event. A couple of days back, she felt, as soon as the
LINE 104: afternoon came, both to move, and both even to utter a word; while the
LINE 105: brightness of her eyes was all dimmed; and I told her, 'You needn't
LINE 106: stick to etiquette, for there's no use for you to come in the forenoon
LINE 107: and evening, as required by conventionalities; but what you must do is,
LINE 108: to look after your own health. Should any relative come over, there's
LINE 109: also myself to receive them; and should any of the senior generation
LINE 110: think your absence strange, I'll explain things for you, if you'll let
LINE 111: me.'
LINE 112: "I also advised brother Jung on the subject: 'You shouldn't,' I said,
LINE 113: 'allow any one to trouble her; nor let her be put out of temper, but let
LINE 114: her quietly attend to her health, and she'll get all right. Should she
LINE 115: fancy anything to eat, just come over here and fetch it; for, in the
LINE 116: event of anything happening to her, were you to try and find another
LINE 117: such a wife to wed, with such a face and such a disposition, why, I
LINE 118: fear, were you even to seek with a lantern in hand, there would really
LINE 119: be no place where you could discover her. And with such a temperament
LINE 120: and deportment as hers, which of our relatives and which of our elders
LINE 121: don't love her?' That's why my heart has been very distressed these two
LINE 122: days! As luck would have it early this morning her brother turned up to
LINE 123: see her, but who would have fancied him to be such a child, and so
LINE 124: ignorant of what is proper and not proper to do? He saw well enough that
LINE 125: his sister was not well; and what's more all these matters shouldn't
LINE 126: have been recounted to her; for even supposing he had received the
LINE 127: gravest offences imaginable, it behoved him anyhow not to have broached
LINE 128: the subject to her! Yesterday, one would scarcely believe it, a fight
LINE 129: occurred in the school-room, and some pupil or other who attends that
LINE 130: class, somehow insulted him; besides, in this business, there were a
LINE 131: good many indecent and improper utterances, but all these he went and
LINE 132: told his sister! Now, sister-in-law, you are well aware that though (our
LINE 133: son Jung's) wife talks and laughs when she sees people, that she is
LINE 134: nevertheless imaginative and withal too sensitive, so that no matter
LINE 135: what she hears, she's for the most part bound to brood over it for three
LINE 136: days and five nights, before she loses sight of it, and it's from this
LINE 137: excessive sensitiveness that this complaint of hers arises. Today, when
LINE 138: she heard that some one had insulted her brother, she felt both vexed
LINE 139: and angry; vexed that those fox-like, cur-like friends of his had moved
LINE 140: right and wrong, and intrigued with this one and deluded that one; angry
LINE 141: that her brother had, by not learning anything profitable, and not
LINE 142: having his mind set upon study, been the means of bringing about a row
LINE 143: at school; and on account of this affair, she was so upset that she did
LINE 144: not even have her early meal. I went over a short while back and
LINE 145: consoled her for a time, and likewise gave her brother a few words of
LINE 146: advice; and after having packed off that brother of hers to the mansion
LINE 147: on the other side, in search of Pao-yü, and having stood by and seen her
LINE 148: have half a bowl of birds' nests soup, I at length came over. Now,
LINE 149: sister-in-law, tell me, is my heart sore or not? Besides, as there's
LINE 150: nowadays no good doctor, the mere thought of her complaint makes my
LINE 151: heart feel as if it were actually pricked with needles! But do you and
LINE 152: yours, perchance, know of any good practitioner?"
LINE 153: Mrs. Chin had, while listening to these words, been, at an early period,
LINE 154: so filled with concern that she cast away to distant lands the reckless
LINE 155: rage she had been in recently while at her sister-in-law's house, when
LINE 156: she had determined to go and discuss matters over with Mrs. Ch'in. Upon
LINE 157: hearing Mrs. Yu inquire of her about a good doctor, she lost no time in
LINE 158: saying by way of reply: "Neither have we heard of any one speak of a
LINE 159: good doctor; but from the account I've just heard of Mrs. Ch'in's
LINE 160: illness, it may still, there's no saying, be some felicitous ailment;
LINE 161: so, sister-in-law, don't let any one treat her recklessly, for were she
LINE 162: to be treated for the wrong thing, the result may be dreadful!"
LINE 163: "Quite so!" replied Mrs. Yu.
LINE 164: But while they were talking, Chia Chen came in from out of doors, and
LINE 165: upon catching sight of Mrs. Chin; "Isn't this Mrs. Huang?" he inquired
LINE 166: of Mrs. Yu; whereupon Mrs. Chin came forward and paid her respects to
LINE 167: Chia Chen.
LINE 168: "Invite this lady to have her repast here before she goes," observed
LINE 169: Chia Chen to Mrs. Yu; and as he uttered these words he forthwith walked
LINE 170: into the room on the off side.
LINE 171: The object of Mrs. Chin's present visit had originally been to talk to
LINE 172: Mrs. Ch'in about the insult which her brother had received from the
LINE 173: hands of Ch'in Chung, but when she heard that Mrs. Ch'in was ill, she
LINE 174: did not have the courage to even so much as make mention of the object
LINE 175: of her errand. Besides, as Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu had given her a most
LINE 176: cordial reception, her resentment was transformed into pleasure, so that
LINE 177: after a while spent in a further chat about one thing and another, she
LINE 178: at length returned to her home.
LINE 179: It was only after the departure of Mrs. Chin that Chia Chen came over
LINE 180: and took a seat. "What did she have to say for herself during this visit
LINE 181: to-day?" he asked of Mrs. Yu.
LINE 182: "She said nothing much," replied Mrs. Yu. "When she first entered the
LINE 183: room, her face bore somewhat of an angry look, but, after a lengthy chat
LINE 184: and as soon as mention of our son's wife's illness was made, this
LINE 185: angered look after all gradually abated. You also asked me to keep her
LINE 186: for the repast, but, having heard that our son's wife was so ill she
LINE 187: could not very well stay, so that all she did was to sit down, and after
LINE 188: making a few more irrelevant remarks, she took her departure. But she
LINE 189: had no request to make. To return however now to the illness of Jung's
LINE 190: wife, it's urgent that you should find somewhere a good doctor to
LINE 191: diagnose it for her; and whatever you do, you should lose no time. The
LINE 192: whole body of doctors who at present go in and out of our household, are
LINE 193: they worth having? Each one of them listens to what the patient has to
LINE 194: say of the ailment, and then, adding a string of flowery sentences, out
LINE 195: he comes with a long rigmarole; but they are exceedingly diligent in
LINE 196: paying us visits; and in one day, three or four of them are here at
LINE 197: least four and five times in rotation! They come and feel her pulse,
LINE 198: they hold consultation together, and write their prescriptions, but,
LINE 199: though she has taken their medicines, she has seen no improvement; on
LINE 200: the contrary, she's compelled to change her clothes three and five times
LINE 201: each day, and to sit up to see the doctor; a thing which, in fact, does
LINE 202: the patient no good."
LINE 203: "This child too is somewhat simple," observed Chia Chen; "for what need
LINE 204: has she to be taking off her clothes, and changing them for others? And
LINE 205: were she again to catch a chill, she would add something more to her
LINE 206: illness; and won't it be dreadful! The clothes may be no matter how
LINE 207: fine, but what is their worth, after all? The health of our child is
LINE 208: what is important to look to! and were she even to wear out a suit of
LINE 209: new clothes a-day, what would that too amount to? I was about to tell
LINE 210: you that a short while back, Feng Tzu-ying came to see me, and,
LINE 211: perceiving that I had somewhat of a worried look, he asked me what was
LINE 212: up; and I told him that our son's wife was not well at all, that as we
LINE 213: couldn't get any good doctor, we couldn't determine with any certainty,
LINE 214: whether she was in an interesting condition, or whether she was
LINE 215: suffering from some disease; that as we could neither tell whether there
LINE 216: was any danger or not, my heart was, for this reason, really very much
LINE 217: distressed. Feng Tzu-ying then explained that he knew a young doctor who
LINE 218: had made a study of his profession, Chang by surname, and Yu-shih by
LINE 219: name, whose learning was profound to a degree; who was besides most
LINE 220: proficient in the principles of medicine, and had the knack of
LINE 221: discriminating whether a patient would live or die; that this year he
LINE 222: had come to the capital to purchase an official rank for his son, and
LINE 223: that he was now living with him in his house. In view of these
LINE 224: circumstances, not knowing but that if, perchance, the case of our
LINE 225: daughter-in-law were placed in his hands, he couldn't avert the danger,
LINE 226: I readily despatched a servant, with a card of mine, to invite him to
LINE 227: come; but the hour to-day being rather late, he probably won't be round,
LINE 228: but I believe he's sure to be here to-morrow. Besides, Feng-Tzu-ying was
LINE 229: also on his return home, to personally entreat him on my behalf, so that
LINE 230: he's bound, when he has asked him, to come and see her. Let's therefore
LINE 231: wait till Dr. Chang has been here and seen her, when we can talk matters
LINE 232: over!"
LINE 233: Mrs. Yu was very much cheered when she heard what was said. "The day
LINE 234: after to-morrow," she felt obliged to add, "is again our senior's, Mr.
LINE 235: Chia Ching's birthday, and how are we to celebrate it after all?"
LINE 236: "I've just been over to our Senior's and paid my respects," replied Chia
LINE 237: Chen, "and further invited the old gentleman to come home, and receive
LINE 238: the congratulations of the whole family.
LINE 239: "'I'm accustomed,' our Senior explained, 'to peace and quiet, and have
LINE 240: no wish to go over to that worldly place of yours; for you people are
LINE 241: certain to have published that it's my birthday, and to entertain the
LINE 242: design to ask me to go round to receive the bows of the whole lot of
LINE 243: you. But won't it be better if you were to give the "Record of
LINE 244: Meritorious Acts," which I annotated some time ago, to some one to copy
LINE 245: out clean for me, and have it printed? Compared with asking me to come,
LINE 246: and uselessly receive the obeisances of you all, this will be yea even a
LINE 247: hundred times more profitable! In the event of the whole family wishing
LINE 248: to pay me a visit on any of the two days, to-morrow or the day after
LINE 249: to-morrow, if you were to stay at home and entertain them in proper
LINE 250: style, that will be all that is wanted; nor will there be any need to
LINE 251: send me anything! Even you needn't come two days from this; and should
LINE 252: you not feel contented at heart, well, you had better bow your head
LINE 253: before me to-day before you go. But if you do come again the day after
LINE 254: to-morrow, with a lot of people to disturb me, I shall certainly be
LINE 255: angry with you.' After what he said, I will not venture to go and see
LINE 256: him two days hence; but you had better send for Lai Sheng, and bid him
LINE 257: get ready a banquet to continue for a couple of days."
LINE 258: Mrs. Yu, having asked Chia Jung to come round, told him to direct Lai
LINE 259: Sheng to make the usual necessary preparations for a banquet to last for
LINE 260: a couple of days, with due regard to a profuse and sumptuous style.
LINE 261: "You go by-and-by," (she advised him), "in person to the Western Mansion
LINE 262: and invite dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and your
LINE 263: sister-in-law Secunda lady Lien to come over for a stroll. Your father
LINE 264: has also heard of a good doctor, and having already sent some one to ask
LINE 265: him round, I think that by to-morrow he's sure to come; and you had
LINE 266: better tell him, in a minute manner, the serious symptoms of her ailment
LINE 267: during these few days."
LINE 268: Chia Jung having signified his obedience to each of her recommendations,
LINE 269: and taken his leave, was just in time to meet the youth coming back from
LINE 270: Feng Tzu-ying's house, whither he had gone a short while back to invite
LINE 271: the doctor round.
LINE 272: "Your slave," he consequently reported, "has just been with a card of
LINE 273: master's to Mr. Feng's house and asked the doctor to come. 'The gentleman
LINE 274: here,' replied the doctor, 'has just told me about it; but to-day, I've
LINE 275: had to call on people the whole day, and I've only this moment come
LINE 276: home; and I feel now my strength (so worn out), that I couldn't really
LINE 277: stand any exertion. In fact were I even to get as far as the mansion, I
LINE 278: shouldn't be in a fit state to diagnose the pulses! I must therefore
LINE 279: have a night's rest, but, to-morrow for certain, I shall come to the
LINE 280: mansion. My medical knowledge,' he went on to observe, 'is very shallow,
LINE 281: and I don't deserve the honour of such eminent recommendation; but as
LINE 282: Mr. Feng has already thus spoken of me in your mansion, I can't but
LINE 283: present myself. It will be all right if in anticipation you deliver this
LINE 284: message for me to your honourable master; but as for your worthy
LINE 285: master's card, I cannot really presume to keep it.' It was again at his
LINE 286: instance that I've brought it back; but, Sir, please mention this result
LINE 287: for me (to master)."
LINE 288: Chia Jung turned back again, and entering the house delivered the
LINE 289: message to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; whereupon he walked out, and, calling
LINE 290: Lai Sheng before him, he transmitted to him the orders to prepare the
LINE 291: banquet for a couple of days.
LINE 292: After Lai Sheng had listened to the directions, he went off, of course,
LINE 293: to get ready the customary preparations; but upon these we shall not
LINE 294: dilate, but confine ourselves to the next day.
LINE 295: At noon, a servant on duty at the gate announced that the Doctor Chang,
LINE 296: who had been sent for, had come, and Chia Chen conducted him along the
LINE 297: Court into the large reception Hall, where they sat down; and after they
LINE 298: had partaken of tea, he broached the subject.
LINE 299: "Yesterday," he explained, "the estimable Mr. Feng did me the honour to
LINE 300: speak to me of your character and proficiency, venerable doctor, as well
LINE 301: as of your thorough knowledge of medicine, and I, your mean brother, was
LINE 302: filled with an immeasurable sense of admiration!"
LINE 303: "Your Junior," remonstrated Dr. Chang, "is a coarse, despicable and mean
LINE 304: scholar and my knowledge is shallow and vile! but as worthy Mr. Feng did
LINE 305: me the honour yesterday of telling me that your family, sir, had
LINE 306: condescended to look upon me, a low scholar, and to favour me too with
LINE 307: an invitation, could I presume not to obey your commands? But as I
LINE 308: cannot boast of the least particle of real learning, I feel overburdened
LINE 309: with shame!"
LINE 310: "Why need you be so modest?" observed Chia Chen; "Doctor, do please walk
LINE 311: in at once to see our son's wife, for I look up, with full reliance, to
LINE 312: your lofty intelligence to dispel my solicitude!"
LINE 313: Chia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the inner
LINE 314: apartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch'in, he turned round and asked
LINE 315: Chia Jung, "This is your honourable spouse, isn't it?"
LINE 316: "Yes, it is," assented Chia Jung; "but please, Doctor, take a seat, and
LINE 317: let me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife's ailment, before her
LINE 318: pulse be felt. Will this do?"
LINE 319: "My mean idea is," remarked the Doctor, "that it would, after all, be
LINE 320: better that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you to
LINE 321: inform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit I
LINE 322: pay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge of
LINE 323: anything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over to
LINE 324: see you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I have
LINE 325: now made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not,
LINE 326: before you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last few
LINE 327: days, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to the
LINE 328: suitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will then
LINE 329: have to decide, and what is necessary will have been done."
LINE 330: "Doctor," rejoined Chia Jung, "you are indeed eminently clear sighted;
LINE 331: all I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor,
LINE 332: diagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hope
LINE 333: of a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means of
LINE 334: allaying the solicitude of my father and mother."
LINE 335: The married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow;
LINE 336: and as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch'in to rest her arm on, they
LINE 337: raised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed.
LINE 338: The Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of the
LINE 339: right hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able to
LINE 340: count the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action for
LINE 341: a considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again went
LINE 342: through the same operation.
LINE 343: "Let us go and sit outside," he suggested, after he had concluded
LINE 344: feeling her pulses. Chia Jung readily adjourned, in company with the
LINE 345: Doctor, to the outer apartment, where they seated themselves on the
LINE 346: stove-couch. A matron having served tea; "Please take a cup of tea,
LINE 347: doctor," Chia Jung observed. When tea was over, "Judging," he inquired,
LINE 348: "Doctor, from the present action of the pulses, is there any remedy or
LINE 349: not?"
LINE 350: "The action of the pulse, under the forefinger, on the left hand of your
LINE 351: honorable spouse," proceeded the Doctor, "is deep and agitated; the left
LINE 352: hand pulse, under the second finger, is deep and faint. The pulse, under
LINE 353: the forefinger, of the right hand, is gentle and lacks vitality. The
LINE 354: right hand pulse, under my second finger, is superficial, and has lost
LINE 355: all energy. The deep and agitated beating of the forepulse of the left
LINE 356: hand arises from the febrile state, due to the weak action of the heart.
LINE 357: The deep and delicate condition of the second part of the pulse of the
LINE 358: left wrist, emanates from the sluggishness of the liver, and the
LINE 359: scarcity of the blood in that organ. The action of the forefinger pulse,
LINE 360: of the right wrist, is faint and lacks strength, as the breathing of the
LINE 361: lungs is too weak. The second finger pulse of the right wrist is
LINE 362: superficial and devoid of vigour, as the spleen must be affected
LINE 363: injuriously by the liver. The weak action of the heart, and its febrile
LINE 364: state, should be the natural causes which conduce to the present
LINE 365: irregularity in the catamenia, and insomnia at night; the poverty of
LINE 366: blood in the liver, and the sluggish condition of that organ must
LINE 367: necessarily produce pain in the ribs; while the overdue of the
LINE 368: catamenia, the cardiac fever, and debility of the respiration of the
LINE 369: lungs, should occasion frequent giddiness in the head, and swimming of
LINE 370: the eyes, the certain recurrence of perspiration between the periods of
LINE 371: 3 to 5 and 5 to 7, and the sensation of being seated on board ship. The
LINE 372: obstruction of the spleen by the liver should naturally create distaste
LINE 373: for liquid or food, debility of the vital energies and prostration of
LINE 374: the four limbs. From my diagnosis of these pulses, there should exist
LINE 375: these various symptoms, before (the pulses and the symptoms can be said)
LINE 376: to harmonise. But should perchance (any doctor maintain) that this state
LINE 377: of the pulses imports a felicitous event, your servant will not presume
LINE 378: to give an ear to such an opinion!"
LINE 379: A matron, who was attached as a personal attendant (to Mrs. Ch'in,) and
LINE 380: who happened to be standing by interposed: "How could it be otherwise?"
LINE 381: she ventured. "In real truth, Doctor, you speak like a supernatural
LINE 382: being, and there's verily no need for us to say anything! We have now,
LINE 383: ready at hand, in our household, a good number of medical gentlemen, who
LINE 384: are in attendance upon her, but none of these are proficient enough to
LINE 385: speak in this positive manner. Some there are who say that it's a
LINE 386: genital complaint; others maintain that it's an organic disease. This
LINE 387: doctor explains that there is no danger: while another, again, holds
LINE 388: that there's fear of a crisis either before or after the winter
LINE 389: solstice; but there is, in one word, nothing certain said by them. May
LINE 390: it please you, sir, now to favour us with your clear directions."
LINE 391: "This complaint of your lady's," observed the Doctor, "has certainly
LINE 392: been neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment with
LINE 393: certain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence of
LINE 394: her habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfect
LINE 395: cure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint has
LINE 396: now been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamity
LINE 397: was, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, as
LINE 398: yet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but we
LINE 399: will see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine.
LINE 400: Should they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be added
LINE 401: furthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From my
LINE 402: diagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a preëminently excellent,
LINE 403: and intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence is
LINE 404: the cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties give
LINE 405: origin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises from
LINE 406: the injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from the
LINE 407: inordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot come
LINE 408: at the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretofore
LINE 409: at the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia,
LINE 410: then necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?"
LINE 411: "To be sure she did," replied the matron; "but she has never been
LINE 412: subject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to three
LINE 413: days, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days."
LINE 414: "Quite so!" observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, "and
LINE 415: this is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days been
LINE 416: treated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improve
LINE 417: the respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtly
LINE 418: made itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of water
LINE 419: and the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we'll
LINE 420: see how she gets on!"
LINE 421: There and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handed
LINE 422: to Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement of
LINE 423: respiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of the
LINE 424: spleen. Ginseng, Atractylodes Lancea; Yunnan root; Prepared Ti root;
LINE 425: Aralia edulis; Peony roots; Levisticum from Sze Ch'uan; Sophora
LINE 426: tormentosa; Cyperus rotundus, prepared with rice; Gentian, soaked in
LINE 427: vinegar; Huai Shan Yao root; Real "O" glue; Carydalis Ambigua; and Dried
LINE 428: liquorice. Seven Fukien lotus seeds, (the cores of which should be
LINE 429: extracted,) and two large zizyphi to be used as a preparative.
LINE 430: "What exalted intelligence!" Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed.
LINE 431: "But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whether
LINE 432: this illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?"
LINE 433: The Doctor smiled. "You, sir, who are endowed with most eminent
LINE 434: intelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reached
LINE 435: this phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; but
LINE 436: after these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch the
LINE 437: effect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winter
LINE 438: of this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox,
LINE 439: I entertain hopes of a complete cure."
LINE 440: Chia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that he
LINE 441: did not press any further minute questions.
LINE 442: Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the
LINE 443: prescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his
LINE 444: perusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that
LINE 445: had been said on the subject.
LINE 446: "The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positive
LINE 447: as this one has done," observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to Chia
LINE 448: Chen, "so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the right
LINE 449: ones!"
LINE 450: "He really isn't a man," rejoined Chia Chen, "accustomed to give much of
LINE 451: his time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for his
LINE 452: support: and it's Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who is
LINE 453: mainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, in
LINE 454: inducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of our
LINE 455: son's wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. But
LINE 456: on that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you had
LINE 457: better make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the other
LINE 458: day."
LINE 459: Chia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after which
LINE 460: he left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in order
LINE 461: that they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch'in.
LINE 462: What was the state of Mrs. Ch'in's illness, after she partook of these
LINE 463: medicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation given
LINE 464: in the chapter which follows.
