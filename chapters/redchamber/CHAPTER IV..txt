LINE 1: An ill-fated girl happens to meet an ill-fated young man.
LINE 2: The Hu Lu Bonze adjudicates the Hu Lu case.
LINE 3: Tai-yü, for we shall now return to our story, having come, along with
LINE 4: her cousin to madame Wang's apartments, found madame Wang discussing
LINE 5: certain domestic occurrences with the messengers, who had arrived from
LINE 6: her elder brother's wife's home, and conversing also about the case of
LINE 7: homicide, in which the family of her mother's sister had become
LINE 8: involved, and other such relevant topics. Perceiving how pressing and
LINE 9: perplexing were the matters in which madame Wang was engaged, the young
LINE 10: ladies promptly left her apartments, and came over to the rooms of their
LINE 11: widow sister-in-law, Mrs. Li.
LINE 12: This Mrs. Li had originally been the spouse of Chia Chu. Although Chu
LINE 13: had died at an early age, he had the good fortune of leaving behind him
LINE 14: a son, to whom the name of Chia Lan was given. He was, at this period,
LINE 15: just in his fifth year, and had already entered school, and applied
LINE 16: himself to books.
LINE 17: This Mrs. Li was also the daughter of an official of note in Chin Ling.
LINE 18: Her father's name was Li Shou-chung, who had, at one time, been Imperial
LINE 19: Libationer. Among his kindred, men as well as women had all devoted
LINE 20: themselves to poetry and letters; but ever since Li Shou-chung continued
LINE 21: the line of succession, he readily asserted that the absence of literary
LINE 22: attainments in his daughter was indeed a virtue, so that it soon came
LINE 23: about that she did not apply herself in real earnest to learning; with
LINE 24: the result that all she studied were some parts of the "Four Books for
LINE 25: women," and the "Memoirs of excellent women," that all she read did not
LINE 26: extend beyond a limited number of characters, and that all she committed
LINE 27: to memory were the examples of these few worthy female characters of
LINE 28: dynasties of yore; while she attached special importance to spinning and
LINE 29: female handiwork. To this reason is to be assigned the name selected for
LINE 30: her, of Li Wan (Li, the weaver), and the style of Kung Ts'ai (Palace
LINE 31: Sempstress).
LINE 32: Hence it was that, though this Li Wan still continued, after the loss of
LINE 33: her mate, while she was as yet in the spring of her life, to live amidst
LINE 34: affluence and luxury, she nevertheless resembled in every respect a
LINE 35: block of rotten wood or dead ashes. She had no inclination whatsoever to
LINE 36: inquire after anything or to listen to anything; while her sole and
LINE 37: exclusive thought was to wait upon her relatives and educate her son;
LINE 38: and, in addition to this, to teach her young sisters-in-law to do
LINE 39: needlework and to read aloud.
LINE 40: Tai-yü was, it is true, at this period living as a guest in the Chia
LINE 41: mansion, where she certainly had the several young ladies to associate
LINE 42: with her, but, outside her aged father, (she thought) there was really
LINE 43: no need for her to extend affection to any of the rest.
LINE 44: But we will now speak of Chia Yü-ts'un. Having obtained the appointment
LINE 45: of Prefect of Ying T'ien, he had no sooner arrived at his post than a
LINE 46: charge of manslaughter was laid before his court. This had arisen from
LINE 47: some rivalry between two parties in the purchase of a slave-girl, either
LINE 48: of whom would not yield his right; with the result that a serious
LINE 49: assault occurred, which ended in homicide.
LINE 50: Yü-ts'un had, with all promptitude, the servants of the plaintiffs
LINE 51: brought before him, and subjected them to an examination.
LINE 52: "The victim of the assault," the plaintiffs deposed, "was your servants'
LINE 53: master. Having on a certain day, purchased a servant-girl, she
LINE 54: unexpectedly turned out to be a girl who had been carried away and sold
LINE 55: by a kidnapper. This kidnapper had, first of all, got hold of our
LINE 56: family's money, and our master had given out that he would on the third
LINE 57: day, which was a propitious day, take her over into the house, but
LINE 58: this kidnapper stealthily sold her over again to the Hsüeh family. When
LINE 59: we came to know of this, we went in search of the seller to lay hold of
LINE 60: him, and bring back the girl by force. But the Hsüeh party has been all
LINE 61: along _the_ bully of Chin Ling, full of confidence in his wealth,
LINE 62: full of presumption on account of his prestige; and his arrogant menials
LINE 63: in a body seized our master and beat him to death. The murderous master
LINE 64: and his crew have all long ago made good their escape, leaving no trace
LINE 65: behind them, while there only remain several parties not concerned in
LINE 66: the affair. Your servants have for a whole year lodged complaints, but
LINE 67: there has been no one to do our cause justice, and we therefore implore
LINE 68: your Lordship to have the bloodstained criminals arrested, and thus
LINE 69: conduce to the maintenance of humanity and benevolence; and the living,
LINE 70: as well as the dead, will feel boundless gratitude for this heavenly
LINE 71: bounty."
LINE 72: When Yü-ts'un heard their appeal, he flew into a fiery rage. "What!" he
LINE 73: exclaimed. "How could a case of such gravity have taken place as the
LINE 74: murder of a man, and the culprits have been allowed to run away
LINE 75: scot-free, without being arrested? Issue warrants, and despatch
LINE 76: constables to at once lay hold of the relatives of the bloodstained
LINE 77: criminals and bring them to be examined by means of torture."
LINE 78: Thereupon he espied a Retainer, who was standing by the judgment-table,
LINE 79: wink at him, signifying that he should not issue the warrants. Yü-t'sun
LINE 80: gave way to secret suspicion, and felt compelled to desist.
LINE 81: Withdrawing from the Court-room, he retired into a private chamber, from
LINE 82: whence he dismissed his followers, only keeping this single Retainer to
LINE 83: wait upon him.
LINE 84: The Retainer speedily advanced and paid his obeisance. "Your worship,"
LINE 85: he said smiling, "has persistently been rising in official honours, and
LINE 86: increasing in wealth so that, in the course of about eight or nine
LINE 87: years, you have forgotten me."
LINE 88: "Your face is, however, extremely familiar," observed Yü-ts'un, "but I
LINE 89: cannot, for the moment, recall who you are."
LINE 90: "Honourable people forget many things," remarked the Retainer, as he
LINE 91: smiled. "What! Have you even forgotten the place where you started in
LINE 92: life? and do you not remember what occurred, in years gone by, in the Hu
LINE 93: Lu Temple?"
LINE 94: Yü-ts'un was filled with extreme astonishment; and past events then
LINE 95: began to dawn upon him.
LINE 96: The fact is that this Retainer had been at one time a young priest in
LINE 97: the Hu Lu temple; but as, after its destruction by fire, he had no place
LINE 98: to rest his frame, he remembered how light and easy was, after all, this
LINE 99: kind of occupation, and being unable to reconcile himself to the
LINE 100: solitude and quiet of a temple, he accordingly availed himself of his
LINE 101: years, which were as yet few, to let his hair grow, and become a
LINE 102: retainer.
LINE 103: Yü-ts'un had had no idea that it was he. Hastily taking his hand in his,
LINE 104: he smilingly observed, "You are, indeed, an old acquaintance!" and then
LINE 105: pressed him to take a seat, so as to have a chat with more ease, but the
LINE 106: Retainer would not presume to sit down.
LINE 107: "Friendships," Yü-ts'un remarked, putting on a smiling expression,
LINE 108: "contracted in poor circumstances should not be forgotten! This is a
LINE 109: private room; so that if you sat down, what would it matter?"
LINE 110: The Retainer thereupon craved permission to take a seat, and sat down
LINE 111: gingerly, all awry.
LINE 112: "Why did you, a short while back," Yü-ts'un inquired, "not allow me to
LINE 113: issue the warrants?"
LINE 114: "Your illustrious office," replied the Retainer, "has brought your
LINE 115: worship here, and is it likely you have not transcribed some philactery
LINE 116: of your post in this province!"
LINE 117: "What is an office-philactery?" asked Yü-ts'un with alacrity.
LINE 118: "Now-a-days," explained the Retainer, "those who become local officers
LINE 119: provide themselves invariably with a secret list, in which are entered
LINE 120: the names and surnames of the most influential and affluent gentry of
LINE 121: note in the province. This is in vogue in every province. Should
LINE 122: inadvertently, at any moment, one give umbrage to persons of this
LINE 123: status, why, not only office, but I fear even one's life, it would be
LINE 124: difficult to preserve. That's why these lists are called
LINE 125: office-philacteries. This Hsüeh family, just a while back spoken of, how
LINE 126: could your worship presume to provoke? This case in question affords no
LINE 127: difficulties whatever in the way of a settlement; but the prefects, who
LINE 128: have held office before you, have all, by doing violence to the feelings
LINE 129: and good name of these people, come to the end they did."
LINE 130: As he uttered these words, he produced, from inside a purse which he had
LINE 131: handy, a transcribed office-philactery, which he handed over to
LINE 132: Yü-ts'un; who upon perusal, found it full of trite and unpolished
LINE 133: expressions of public opinion, with regard to the leading clans and
LINE 134: notable official families in that particular district. They ran as
LINE 135: follows:
LINE 136: The "Chia" family is not "chia," a myth; white jade form the Halls; gold
LINE 137: compose their horses! The "A Fang" Palace is three hundred li in extent,
LINE 138: but is no fit residence for a "Shih" of Chin Ling. The eastern seas lack
LINE 139: white jade beds, and the "Lung Wang," king of the Dragons, has come to
LINE 140: ask for one of the Chin Ling Wang, (Mr. Wang of Chin Ling.) In a
LINE 141: plenteous year, snow, (Hsüeh,) is very plentiful; their pearls and gems
LINE 142: are like sand, their gold like iron.
LINE 143: Scarcely had Yü-ts'un done reading, when suddenly was heard the
LINE 144: announcement, communicated by the beating of a gong, that Mr. Wang had
LINE 145: come to pay his respects.
LINE 146: Yü-ts'un hastily adjusted his official clothes and hat, and went out of
LINE 147: the room to greet and receive the visitor. Returning after a short while
LINE 148: he proceeded to question the Retainer (about what he had been perusing.)
LINE 149: "These four families," explained the Retainer, "are all interlaced by
LINE 150: ties of relationship, so that if you offend one, you offend all; if you
LINE 151: honour one, you honour all. For support and protection, they all have
LINE 152: those to take care of their interests! Now this Hsüeh, who is charged
LINE 153: with homicide, is indeed the Hsüeh implied by 'in a plenteous year,
LINE 154: (Hsüeh,) snow, is very plentiful.' In fact, not only has he these three
LINE 155: families to rely upon, but his (father's) old friends, and his own
LINE 156: relatives and friends are both to be found in the capital, as well as
LINE 157: abroad in the provinces; and they are, what is more, not few in number.
LINE 158: Who is it then that your Worship purposes having arrested?"
LINE 159: When Yü-ts'un had heard these remarks, he forthwith put on a smile and
LINE 160: inquired of the Retainer, "If what you say be true, how is then this
LINE 161: lawsuit to be settled? Are you also perchance well aware of the place of
LINE 162: retreat of this homicide?"
LINE 163: "I don't deceive your Worship," the Retainer ventured smiling, "when I
LINE 164: say that not only do I know the hiding-place of this homicide, but that
LINE 165: I also am acquainted with the man who kidnapped and sold the girl; I
LINE 166: likewise knew full well the poor devil and buyer, now deceased. But
LINE 167: wait, and I'll tell your worship all, with full details. This person,
LINE 168: who succumbed to the assault, was the son of a minor gentry. His name
LINE 169: was Feng Yüan. His father and mother are both deceased, and he has
LINE 170: likewise no brothers. He looked after some scanty property in order to
LINE 171: eke out a living. His age was eighteen or nineteen; and he had a strong
LINE 172: penchant for men's, and not much for women's society. But this was too
LINE 173: the retribution (for sins committed) in a previous existence! for
LINE 174: coming, by a strange coincidence, in the way of this kidnapper, who was
LINE 175: selling the maid, he straightway at a glance fell in love with this
LINE 176: girl, and made up his mind to purchase her and make her his second wife;
LINE 177: entering an oath not to associate with any male friends, nor even to
LINE 178: marry another girl. And so much in earnest was he in this matter that he
LINE 179: had to wait until after the third day before she could enter his
LINE 180: household (so as to make the necessary preparations for the marriage).
LINE 181: But who would have foreseen the issue? This kidnapper quietly disposed
LINE 182: of her again by sale to the Hsüeh family; his intention being to pocket
LINE 183: the price-money from both parties, and effect his escape. Contrary to
LINE 184: his calculations, he couldn't after all run away in time, and the two
LINE 185: buyers laid hold of him and beat him, till he was half dead; but neither
LINE 186: of them would take his coin back, each insisting upon the possession of
LINE 187: the girl. But do you think that young gentleman, Mr. Hsüeh, would yield
LINE 188: his claim to her person? Why, he at once summoned his servants and bade
LINE 189: them have recourse to force; and, taking this young man Feng, they
LINE 190: assailed him till they made mincemeat of him. He was then carried back
LINE 191: to his home, where he finally died after the expiry of three days. This
LINE 192: young Mr. Hsüeh had previously chosen a day, on which he meant to set
LINE 193: out for the capital, and though he had beaten the young man Feng to
LINE 194: death, and carried off the girl, he nevertheless behaved in the manner
LINE 195: of a man who had had no concern in the affair. And all he gave his mind
LINE 196: to was to take his family and go along on his way; but not in any wise
LINE 197: in order to evade (the consequences) of this (occurrence). This case of
LINE 198: homicide, (he looked upon) as a most trivial and insignificant matter,
LINE 199: which, (he thought), his brother and servants, who were on the spot,
LINE 200: would be enough to settle. But, however, enough of this person. Now does
LINE 201: your worship know who this girl is who was sold?"
LINE 202: "How could I possibly know?" answered Yü-ts'un.
LINE 203: "And yet," remarked the Retainer, as he laughed coldly, "this is a
LINE 204: person to whom you are indebted for great obligations; for she is no one
LINE 205: else than the daughter of Mr. Chen, who lived next door to the Hu Lu
LINE 206: temple. Her infant name is 'Ying Lien.'"
LINE 207: "What! is it really she?" exclaimed Yü-ts'un full of surprise. "I heard
LINE 208: that she had been kidnapped, ever since she was five years old; but has
LINE 209: she only been sold recently?"
LINE 210: "Kidnappers of this kind," continued the Retainer, "only abduct infant
LINE 211: girls, whom they bring up till they reach the age of twelve or thirteen,
LINE 212: when they take them into strange districts and dispose of them through
LINE 213: their agents. In days gone by, we used daily to coax this girl, Ying
LINE 214: Lien, to romp with us, so that we got to be exceedingly friendly. Hence
LINE 215: it is that though, with the lapse of seven or eight years, her mien has
LINE 216: assumed a more surpassingly lovely appearance, her general features
LINE 217: have, on the other hand, undergone no change; and this is why I can
LINE 218: recognise her. Besides, in the centre of her two eyebrows, she had a
LINE 219: spot, of the size of a grain of rice, of carnation colour, which she has
LINE 220: had ever since she was born into the world. This kidnapper, it also
LINE 221: happened, rented my house to live in; and on a certain day, on which the
LINE 222: kidnapper was not at home, I even set her a few questions. She said,
LINE 223: 'that the kidnapper had so beaten her, that she felt intimidated, and
LINE 224: couldn't on any account, venture to speak out; simply averring that the
LINE 225: kidnapper was her own father, and that, as he had no funds to repay his
LINE 226: debts, he had consequently disposed of her by sale!' I tried time after
LINE 227: time to induce her to answer me, but she again gave way to tears and
LINE 228: added no more than: 'I don't really remember anything of my youth.' Of
LINE 229: this, anyhow, there can be no doubt; on a certain day the young man Feng
LINE 230: and the kidnapper met, said the money was paid down; but as the
LINE 231: kidnapper happened to be intoxicated, Ying Lien exclaimed, as she
LINE 232: sighed: 'My punishment has this day been consummated!' Later on again,
LINE 233: when she heard that young Feng would, after three days, have her taken
LINE 234: over to his house, she once more underwent a change and put on such a
LINE 235: sorrowful look that, unable to brook the sight of it, I waited till the
LINE 236: kidnapper went out, when I again told my wife to go and cheer her by
LINE 237: representing to her that this Mr. Feng's fixed purpose to wait for a
LINE 238: propitious day, on which to come and take her over, was ample proof that
LINE 239: he would not look upon her as a servant-girl. 'Furthermore,' (explained
LINE 240: my wife to her), 'he is a sort of person exceedingly given to fast
LINE 241: habits, and has at home ample means to live upon, so that if, besides,
LINE 242: with his extreme aversion to women, he actually purchases you now, at a
LINE 243: fancy price, you should be able to guess the issue, without any
LINE 244: explanation. You have to bear suspense only for two or three days, and
LINE 245: what need is there to be sorrowful and dejected?' After these
LINE 246: assurances, she became somewhat composed, flattering herself that she
LINE 247: would from henceforth have a home of her own.
LINE 248: "But who would believe that the world is but full of disappointments! On
LINE 249: the succeeding day, it came about that the kidnapper again sold her to
LINE 250: the Hsüeh family! Had he disposed of her to any other party, no harm
LINE 251: would anyhow have resulted; but this young gentleman Hsüeh, who is
LINE 252: nicknamed by all, 'the Foolish and overbearing Prince,' is the most
LINE 253: perverse and passionate being in the whole world. What is more, he
LINE 254: throws money away as if it were dust. The day on which he gave the
LINE 255: thrashing with blows like falling leaves and flowing water, he dragged
LINE 256: (_lit_. pull alive, drag dead) Ying Lien away more dead than alive,
LINE 257: by sheer force, and no one, even up to this date, is aware whether she
LINE 258: be among the dead or the living. This young Feng had a spell of empty
LINE 259: happiness; for (not only) was his wish not fulfilled, but on the
LINE 260: contrary he spent money and lost his life; and was not this a lamentable
LINE 261: case?"
LINE 262: When Yü-ts'un heard this account he also heaved a sigh. "This was
LINE 263: indeed," he observed, "a retribution in store for them! Their encounter
LINE 264: was likewise not accidental; for had it been, how was it that this Feng
LINE 265: Yüan took a fancy to Ying Lien?
LINE 266: "This Ying Lien had, during all these years, to endure much harsh
LINE 267: treatment from the hands of the kidnapper, and had, at length, obtained
LINE 268: the means of escape; and being besides full of warm feeling, had he
LINE 269: actually made her his wife, and had they come together, the event would
LINE 270: certainly have been happy; but, as luck would have it, there occurred
LINE 271: again this contretemps.
LINE 272: "This Hsüeh is, it is true, more laden with riches and honours than Feng
LINE 273: was, but when we bear in mind what kind of man he is he certainly, with
LINE 274: his large bevy of handmaids, and his licentious and inordinate habits,
LINE 275: cannot ever be held equal to Feng Yüan, who had set his heart upon one
LINE 276: person! This may appositely be termed a fantastic sentimental destiny,
LINE 277: which, by a strange coincidence, befell a couple consisting of an
LINE 278: ill-fated young fellow and girl! But why discuss third parties? The only
LINE 279: thing now is how to decide this case, so as to put things right."
LINE 280: "Your worship," remarked the Retainer smiling, "displayed, in years gone
LINE 281: by, such great intelligence and decision, and how is it that today you,
LINE 282: on the contrary, become a person without any resources! Your servant has
LINE 283: heard that the promotion of your worship to fill up this office is due
LINE 284: to the exertions of the Chia and Wang families; and as this Hsüeh P'an
LINE 285: is a relative of the Chia mansion, why doesn't your worship take your
LINE 286: craft along with the stream, and bring, by the performance of a
LINE 287: kindness, this case to an issue, so that you may again in days to come,
LINE 288: be able to go and face the two Dukes Chia and Wang?"
LINE 289: "What you suggest," replied Yü-ts'un, "is, of course, right enough; but
LINE 290: this case involves a human life, and honoured as I have been, by His
LINE 291: Majesty the Emperor, by a restoration to office, and selection to an
LINE 292: appointment, how can I at the very moment, when I may strain all my
LINE 293: energies to show my gratitude, by reason of a private consideration, set
LINE 294: the laws at nought? This is a thing which I really haven't the courage
LINE 295: to do."
LINE 296: "What your worship says is naturally right and proper," remarked the
LINE 297: Retainer at these words, smiling sarcastically, "but at the present
LINE 298: stage of the world, such things cannot be done. Haven't you heard the
LINE 299: saying of a man of old to the effect that great men take action suitable
LINE 300: to the times. 'He who presses,' he adds, 'towards what is auspicious and
LINE 301: avoids what is inauspicious is a perfect man.' From what your worship
LINE 302: says, not only you couldn't, by any display of zeal, repay your
LINE 303: obligation to His Majesty, but, what is more, your own life you will
LINE 304: find it difficult to preserve. There are still three more considerations
LINE 305: necessary to insure a safe settlement."
LINE 306: Yü-ts'un drooped his head for a considerable time.
LINE 307: "What is there in your idea to be done?" he at length inquired.
LINE 308: "Your servant," responded the Retainer, "has already devised a most
LINE 309: excellent plan. It's this: To-morrow, when your Lordship sits in court,
LINE 310: you should, merely for form's sake, make much ado, by despatching
LINE 311: letters and issuing warrants for the arrest of the culprits. The
LINE 312: murderer will naturally not be forthcoming; and as the plaintiffs will
LINE 313: be strong in their displeasure, you will of course have some members of
LINE 314: the clan of the Hsüeh family, together with a few servants and others,
LINE 315: taken into custody, and examined under torture, when your servant will
LINE 316: be behind the scenes to bring matters to a settlement, by bidding them
LINE 317: report that the victim had succumbed to a sudden ailment, and by urging
LINE 318: the whole number of the kindred, as well as the headmen of the place, to
LINE 319: hand in a declaration to that effect. Your Worship can aver that you
LINE 320: understand perfectly how to write charms in dust, and conjure the
LINE 321: spirit; having had an altar, covered with dust, placed in the court, you
LINE 322: should bid the military and people to come and look on to their heart's
LINE 323: content. Your Worship can give out that the divining spirit has
LINE 324: declared: 'that the deceased, Feng Yüan, and Hsüeh P'an had been enemies
LINE 325: in a former life, that having now met in the narrow road, their
LINE 326: destinies were consummated; that Hsüeh P'an has, by this time,
LINE 327: contracted some indescribable disease and perished from the effects of
LINE 328: the persecution of the spirit of Feng.' That as the calamity had
LINE 329: originated entirely from the action of the kidnapper, exclusive of
LINE 330: dealing with the kidnapper according to law, the rest need not be
LINE 331: interfered with, and so on. Your servant will be in the background to
LINE 332: speak to the kidnapper and urge him to make a full confession; and when
LINE 333: people find that the response of the divining spirit harmonizes with the
LINE 334: statements of the kidnapper, they will, as a matter of course, entertain
LINE 335: no suspicion.
LINE 336: "The Hsüeh family have plenty of money, so that if your Worship
LINE 337: adjudicates that they should pay five hundred, they can afford it, or
LINE 338: one thousand will also be within their means; and this sum can be handed
LINE 339: to the Feng family to meet the outlay of burning incense and burial
LINE 340: expenses. The Feng family are, besides, people of not much consequence,
LINE 341: and (the fuss made by them) being simply for money, they too will, when
LINE 342: they have got the cash in hand, have nothing more to say. But may it
LINE 343: please your worship to consider carefully this plan and see what you
LINE 344: think of it?"
LINE 345: "It isn't a safe course! It isn't a safe course!" Yü-ts'un observed as
LINE 346: he smiled. "Let me further think and deliberate; and possibly by
LINE 347: succeeding in suppressing public criticism, the matter might also be
LINE 348: settled."
LINE 349: These two closed their consultation by a fixed determination, and the
LINE 350: next day, when he sat in judgment, he marked off a whole company of the
LINE 351: plaintiffs as well as of the accused, as were mentioned by name, and had
LINE 352: them brought before him. Yü-ts'un examined them with additional
LINE 353: minuteness, and discovered in point of fact, that the inmates of the
LINE 354: Feng family were extremely few, that they merely relied upon this charge
LINE 355: with the idea of obtaining some compensation for joss-sticks and
LINE 356: burials; and that the Hsüeh family, presuming on their prestige and
LINE 357: confident of patronage, had been obstinate in the refusal to make any
LINE 358: mutual concession, with the result that confusion had supervened, and
LINE 359: that no decision had been arrived at.
LINE 360: Following readily the bent of his feelings, Yü-ts'un disregarded the
LINE 361: laws, and adjudicated this suit in a random way; and as the Feng family
LINE 362: came in for a considerable sum, with which to meet the expense for
LINE 363: incense and the funeral, they had, after all, not very much to say (in
LINE 364: the way of objections.)
LINE 365: With all despatch, Yü-ts'un wrote and forwarded two letters, one to Chia
LINE 366: Cheng, and the other to Wang Tzu-t'eng, at that time commander-in-chief
LINE 367: of a Metropolitan Division, simply informing them: that the case, in
LINE 368: which their worthy nephew was concerned, had come to a close, and that
LINE 369: there was no need for them to give way to any extreme solicitude.
LINE 370: This case had been settled through the exclusive action of the young
LINE 371: priest of the Hu Lu temple, now an official Retainer; and Yü-ts'un,
LINE 372: apprehending, on the other hand, lest he might in the presence of
LINE 373: others, divulge the circumstances connected with the days gone by, when
LINE 374: he was in a state of penury, naturally felt very unhappy in his mind.
LINE 375: But at a later period, he succeeded, by ultimately finding in him some
LINE 376: shortcoming, and deporting him to a far-away place, in setting his fears
LINE 377: at rest.
LINE 378: But we will put Yü-ts'un on one side, and refer to the young man Hsüeh,
LINE 379: who purchased Ying Lien, and assaulted Feng Yuan to death.
LINE 380: He too was a native of Chin Ling and belonged to a family literary
LINE 381: during successive generations; but this young Hsüeh had recently, when
LINE 382: of tender age, lost his father, and his widowed mother out of pity for
LINE 383: his being the only male issue and a fatherless child, could not help
LINE 384: doating on him and indulging him to such a degree, that when he, in
LINE 385: course of time, grew up to years of manhood, he was good for nothing.
LINE 386: In their home, furthermore, was the wealth of a millionaire, and they
LINE 387: were, at this time, in receipt of an income from His Majesty's privy
LINE 388: purse, for the purvey of various articles.
LINE 389: This young Hsüeh went at school under the name of P'an. His style was
LINE 390: Wen Ch'i. His natural habits were extravagant; his language haughty and
LINE 391: supercilious. He had, of course, also been to school, but all he knew
LINE 392: was a limited number of characters, and those not well. The whole day
LINE 393: long, his sole delight was in cock-fighting and horse-racing, rambling
LINE 394: over hills and doing the sights.
LINE 395: Though a Purveyor, by Imperial appointment, he had not the least idea of
LINE 396: anything relating to matters of business or of the world. All he was
LINE 397: good for was: to take advantage of the friendships enjoyed by his
LINE 398: grandfather in days of old, to present himself at the Board of Revenue
LINE 399: to perfunctorily sign his name and to draw the allowance and rations;
LINE 400: while the rest of his affairs he, needless to say, left his partners and
LINE 401: old servants of the family to manage for him.
LINE 402: His widowed mother, a Miss Wang, was the youngest sister of Wang
LINE 403: Tzu-t'eng, whose present office was that of Commander-in-Chief of a
LINE 404: Metropolitan Division; and was, with Madame Wang, the spouse of Chia
LINE 405: Cheng, of the Jung Kuo Mansion, sisters born of one mother. She was, in
LINE 406: this year, more or less forty years of age and had only one son: this
LINE 407: Hsüeh P'an.
LINE 408: She also had a daughter, who was two years younger than Hsüeh P'an, and
LINE 409: whose infant name was Pao Ch'ai. She was beautiful in appearance, and
LINE 410: elegant and refined in deportment. In days gone by, when her father
LINE 411: lived, he was extremely fond of this girl, and had her read books and
LINE 412: study characters, so that, as compared with her brother, she was
LINE 413: actually a hundred times his superior. Having become aware, ever since
LINE 414: her father's death, that her brother could not appease the anguish of
LINE 415: her mother's heart, she at once dispelled all thoughts of books, and
LINE 416: gave her sole mind to needlework, to the menage and other such concerns,
LINE 417: so as to be able to participate in her mother's sorrow, and to bear the
LINE 418: fatigue in lieu of her.
LINE 419: As of late the Emperor on the Throne held learning and propriety in high
LINE 420: esteem, His Majesty called together and singled out talent and ability,
LINE 421: upon which he deigned to display exceptional grace and favour. Besides
LINE 422: the number called forth from private life and chosen as Imperial
LINE 423: secondary wives, the daughters of families of hereditary official status
LINE 424: and renown were without exception, reported by name to the authorities,
LINE 425: and communicated to the Board, in anticipation of the selection for
LINE 426: maids in waiting to the Imperial Princesses and daughters of Imperial
LINE 427: Princes in their studies, and for filling up the offices of persons of
LINE 428: eminence, to urge them to become excellent.
LINE 429: Ever since the death of Hsüeh P'an's father, the various assistants,
LINE 430: managers and partners, and other employes in the respective provinces,
LINE 431: perceiving how youthful Hsüeh P'an was in years, and how much he lacked
LINE 432: worldly experience, readily availed themselves of the time to begin
LINE 433: swindling and defrauding. The business, carried on in various different
LINE 434: places in the capital, gradually also began to fall off and to show a
LINE 435: deficit.
LINE 436: Hsüeh P'an had all along heard that the capital was the _one_ place
LINE 437: for gaieties, and was just entertaining the idea of going on a visit,
LINE 438: when he eagerly jumped at the opportunity (that presented itself,) first
LINE 439: of all to escort his sister, who was going to wait for the selection, in
LINE 440: the second place to see his relatives, and in the third to enter
LINE 441: personally the capital, (professedly) to settle up long-standing
LINE 442: accounts, and to make arrangements for new outlays, but, in reality,
LINE 443: with the sole purpose of seeing the life and splendour of the
LINE 444: metropolis.
LINE 445: He therefore, had, at an early period, got ready his baggage and small
LINE 446: luggage, as well as the presents for relatives and friends, things of
LINE 447: every description of local production, presents in acknowledgment of
LINE 448: favours received, and other such effects, and he was about to choose a
LINE 449: day to start on his journey when unexpectedly he came in the way of the
LINE 450: kidnapper who offered Ying Lien for sale. As soon as Hsüeh P'an saw how
LINE 451: _distinguée_ Ying Lien was in her appearance, he formed the
LINE 452: resolution of buying her; and when he encountered Feng Yüan, come with
LINE 453: the object of depriving him of her, he in the assurance of superiority,
LINE 454: called his sturdy menials together, who set upon Feng Yüan and beat him
LINE 455: to death. Forthwith collecting all the affairs of the household, and
LINE 456: entrusting them one by one to the charge of some members of the clan and
LINE 457: several elderly servants of the family, he promptly took his mother,
LINE 458: sister and others and after all started on his distant journey, while
LINE 459: the charge of homicide he, however, treated as child's play, flattering
LINE 460: himself that if he spent a few filthy pieces of money, there was no
LINE 461: doubt as to its settlement.
LINE 462: He had been on his journey how many days, he had not reckoned, when, on
LINE 463: a certain day, as they were about to enter the capital, he furthermore
LINE 464: heard that his maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had been raised to the
LINE 465: rank of Supreme Governor of nine provinces, and had been honoured with
LINE 466: an Imperial command to leave the capital and inspect the frontiers.
LINE 467: Hsüeh P'an was at heart secretly elated. "I was just lamenting," he
LINE 468: thought, "that on my visit to the capital, I would have my maternal
LINE 469: uncle to exercise control over me, and that I wouldn't be able to gambol
LINE 470: and frisk to my heart's content, but now that he is leaving the capital,
LINE 471: on promotion, it's evident that Heaven accomplishes man's wishes."
LINE 472: As he consequently held consultation with his mother; "Though we have,"
LINE 473: he argued, "several houses of our own in the capital, yet for these last
LINE 474: ten years or so, there has been no one to live in them, and the people
LINE 475: charged with the looking after them must unavoidably have stealthily
LINE 476: rented them to some one or other. It's therefore needful to let servants
LINE 477: go ahead to sweep and get the place in proper order, before we can very
LINE 478: well go ourselves."
LINE 479: "What need is there to go to such trouble?" retorted his mother; "the
LINE 480: main object of our present visit to the capital is first of all to pay
LINE 481: our respects to our relatives and friends; and it is, either at your
LINE 482: elder uncle's, my brother's place, or at your other uncle's, my sister's
LINE 483: husband's home, both of which families' houses are extremely spacious,
LINE 484: that we can put up provisionally, and by and bye, at our ease, we can
LINE 485: send servants to make our house tidy. Now won't this be a considerable
LINE 486: saving of trouble?"
LINE 487: "My uncle, your brother," suggested Hsüeh P'an, "has just been raised to
LINE 488: an appointment in an outside province, so that, of course, in his house,
LINE 489: things must be topsy-turvey, on account of his departure; and should we
LINE 490: betake ourselves, like a hive of bees and a long trail, to him for
LINE 491: shelter; won't we appear very inconsiderate?"
LINE 492: "Your uncle," remarked his mother, "is, it is true, going on promotion,
LINE 493: but there's besides the house of your aunt, my sister. What is more,
LINE 494: during these last few years from both your uncle's and aunt's have, time
LINE 495: after time, been sent messages, and letters forwarded, asking us to come
LINE 496: over; and now that we've come, is it likely, though your uncle is busy
LINE 497: with his preparations to start on his journey, that your aunt of the
LINE 498: Chia family won't do all she can to press us to stay? Besides, were we
LINE 499: to have our house got ready in a scramble, won't it make people think it
LINE 500: strange? I however know your idea very well that were we kept to stay at
LINE 501: your uncle's and aunt's, you won't escape being under strict restraint,
LINE 502: unlike what would be the case were we to live in our own house, as you
LINE 503: would be free then to act as you please! Such being the case, go, on
LINE 504: your own account, and choose some place to take up your quarters in,
LINE 505: while I myself, who have been separated from your aunt and cousins for
LINE 506: these several years, would however like to stay with them for a few
LINE 507: days; and I'll go along with your sister and look up your aunt at her
LINE 508: home. What do you say; will this suit you or not?"
LINE 509: Hsüeh P'an, upon hearing his mother speak in this strain, knew well
LINE 510: enough that he could not bring her round from her determination; and he
LINE 511: had no help but to issue the necessary directions to the servants to
LINE 512: make straight for the Jung Kuo mansion. Madame Wang had by this time
LINE 513: already come to know that in the lawsuit, in which Hsüeh P'an was
LINE 514: concerned, Chia Yü-ts'un had fortunately intervened and lent his good
LINE 515: offices, and was at length more composed in her mind. But when she again
LINE 516: saw that her eldest brother had been advanced to a post on the frontier,
LINE 517: she was just deploring that, deprived of the intercourse of the
LINE 518: relatives of her mother's family, how doubly lonely she would feel;
LINE 519: when, after the lapse of a few days, some one of the household brought
LINE 520: the unexpected announcement that "our lady, your sister, has, with the
LINE 521: young gentleman, the young lady and her whole household, entered the
LINE 522: capital and have dismounted from their vehicles outside the main
LINE 523: entrance." This news so delighted madame Wang that she rushed out, with
LINE 524: a few attendants, to greet them in the large Entrance Hall, and brought
LINE 525: Mrs. Hsüeh and the others into her house.
LINE 526: The two sisters were now reunited, at an advanced period of their lives,
LINE 527: so that mixed feelings of sorrow and joy thronged together, but on these
LINE 528: it is, of course, needless to dilate.
LINE 529: After conversing for a time on what had occurred, subsequent to their
LINE 530: separation, madame Wang took them to pay their obeisance to dowager lady
LINE 531: Chia. They then handed over the various kinds of presents and indigenous
LINE 532: articles, and after the whole family had been introduced, a banquet was
LINE 533: also spread to greet the guests.
LINE 534: Hsüeh P'an, having paid his respects to Chia Cheng and Chia Lien, was
LINE 535: likewise taken to see Chia She, Chia Chen and the other members.
LINE 536: Chia Cheng sent a messenger to tell madame Wang that "'aunt' Hsüeh had
LINE 537: already seen many springs and autumns, while their nephew was of tender
LINE 538: age, with no experience, so that there was every fear, were he to live
LINE 539: outside, that something would again take place. In the South-east corner
LINE 540: of our compound," (he sent word,) "there are in the Pear Fragrance
LINE 541: Court, over ten apartments, all of which are vacant and lying idle; and
LINE 542: were we to tell the servants to sweep them, and invite 'aunt' Hsüeh and
LINE 543: the young gentleman and lady to take up their quarters there, it would
LINE 544: be an extremely wise thing."
LINE 545: Madame Wang had in fact been entertaining the wish to keep them to live
LINE 546: with them, when dowager lady Chia also sent some one to say that, "Mrs.
LINE 547: Hsüeh should be asked to put up in the mansion in order that a greater
LINE 548: friendliness should exist between them all."
LINE 549: Mrs. Hsüeh herself had all along been desirous to live in one place with
LINE 550: her relatives, so as to be able to keep a certain check over her son,
LINE 551: fearing that, if they lived in a separate house outside, the natural
LINE 552: bent of his habits would run riot, and that some calamity would be
LINE 553: brought on; and she therefore, there and then, expressed her sense of
LINE 554: appreciation, and accepted the invitation. She further privately told
LINE 555: madame Wang in clear terms, that every kind of daily expense and general
LINE 556: contribution would have to be entirely avoided and withdrawn as that
LINE 557: would be the only thing to justify her to make any protracted stay. And
LINE 558: madame Wang aware that she had, in her home, no difficulty in this line,
LINE 559: promptly in fact complied with her wishes.
LINE 560: From this date it was that "aunt" Hsüeh and her children took up their
LINE 561: quarters in the Pear Fragrance Court.
LINE 562: This Court of Pear Fragrance had, we must explain, been at one time used
LINE 563: as a place for the quiet retirement of the Duke Jung in his advanced
LINE 564: years. It was on a small scale, but ingeniously laid out. There were, at
LINE 565: least, over ten structures. The front halls and the back houses were all
LINE 566: in perfect style. There was a separate door giving on to the street, and
LINE 567: the people of the household of Hsüeh P'an used this door to go in and
LINE 568: out. At the south-west quarter, there was also a side door, which
LINE 569: communicated with a narrow roadway. Beyond this narrow road, was the
LINE 570: eastern court of madame Wang's principal apartment; so that every day,
LINE 571: either after her repast, or in the evening, Mrs. Hsüeh would readily
LINE 572: come over and converse, on one thing and another, with dowager lady
LINE 573: Chia, or have a chat with madame Wang; while Pao-ch'ai came together,
LINE 574: day after day, with Tai yü, Ying-ch'un, her sisters and the other girls,
LINE 575: either to read, to play chess, or to do needlework, and the pleasure
LINE 576: which they derived was indeed perfect.
LINE 577: Hsüeh P'an however had all along from the first instance, been loth to
LINE 578: live in the Chia mansion, as he dreaded that with the discipline
LINE 579: enforced by his uncle, he would not be able to be his own master; but
LINE 580: his mother had made up her mind so positively to remain there, and what
LINE 581: was more, every one in the Chia mansion was most pressing in their
LINE 582: efforts to keep them, that there was no alternative for him but to take
LINE 583: up his quarters temporarily there, while he at the same time directed
LINE 584: servants to go and sweep the apartments of their own house, with a view
LINE 585: that they should move into them when they were ready.
LINE 586: But, contrary to expectation, after they had been in their quarters for
LINE 587: not over a month, Hsüeh P'an came to be on intimate relations with all
LINE 588: the young men among the kindred of the Chia mansion, the half of whom
LINE 589: were extravagant in their habits, so that great was, of course, his
LINE 590: delight to frequent them. To-day, they would come together to drink
LINE 591: wine; the next day to look at flowers. They even assembled to gamble, to
LINE 592: dissipate and to go everywhere and anywhere; leading, with all their
LINE 593: enticements, Hsüeh P'an so far astray, that he became far worse, by a
LINE 594: hundred times, than he was hitherto.
LINE 595: Although it must be conceded that Chia Cheng was in the education of his
LINE 596: children quite correct, and in the control of his family quite
LINE 597: systematic, yet in the first place, the clan was so large and the
LINE 598: members so numerous, that he was unable to attend to the entire
LINE 599: supervision; and, in the second place, the head of the family, at this
LINE 600: period, was Chia Chen, who, as the eldest grandchild of the Ning
LINE 601: mansion, had likewise now come into the inheritance of the official
LINE 602: status, with the result that all matters connected with the clan
LINE 603: devolved upon his sole and exclusive control. In the third place, public
LINE 604: as well as private concerns were manifold and complex, and being a man
LINE 605: of negligent disposition, he estimated ordinary affairs of so little
LINE 606: consequence that any respite from his official duties he devoted to no
LINE 607: more than the study of books and the playing of chess.
LINE 608: Furthermore, this Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two rows of
LINE 609: buildings from his quarters and was also provided with a separate door
LINE 610: opening into the street, so that, being able at their own heart's desire
LINE 611: to go out and to come in, these several young fellows could well indulge
LINE 612: their caprices, and gratify the bent of their minds.
LINE 613: Hence it was that Hsüeh P'an, in course of time gradually extinguished
LINE 614: from his memory every idea of shifting their quarters.
LINE 615: But what transpired, on subsequent days, the following chapter will
LINE 616: explain.
