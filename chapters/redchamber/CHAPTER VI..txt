LINE 1: Chia Pao-yü reaps his first experience in licentious love.
LINE 2: Old Goody Liu pays a visit to the Jung Kuo Mansion.
LINE 3: Mrs. Ch'in, to resume our narrative, upon hearing Pao-yü call her in his
LINE 4: dream by her infant name, was at heart very exercised, but she did not
LINE 5: however feel at liberty to make any minute inquiry.
LINE 6: Pao-yü was, at this time, in such a dazed state, as if he had lost
LINE 7: something, and the servants promptly gave him a decoction of lungngan.
LINE 8: After he had taken a few sips, he forthwith rose and tidied his clothes.
LINE 9: Hsi Jen put out her hand to fasten the band of his garment, and as soon
LINE 10: as she did so, and it came in contact with his person, it felt so icy
LINE 11: cold to the touch, covered as it was all over with perspiration, that
LINE 12: she speedily withdrew her hand in utter surprise.
LINE 13: "What's the matter with you?" she exclaimed.
LINE 14: A blush suffused Pao-yü's face, and he took Hsi Jen's hand in a tight
LINE 15: grip. Hsi Jen was a girl with all her wits about her; she was besides a
LINE 16: couple of years older than Pao-yü and had recently come to know
LINE 17: something of the world, so that at the sight of his state, she to a
LINE 18: great extent readily accounted for the reason in her heart. From modest
LINE 19: shame, she unconsciously became purple in the face, and not venturing to
LINE 20: ask another question she continued adjusting his clothes. This task
LINE 21: accomplished, she followed him over to old lady Chia's apartments; and
LINE 22: after a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jen
LINE 23: availed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to hand
LINE 24: Pao-yü another garment to change.
LINE 25: "Please, dear Hsi Jen, don't tell any one," entreated Pao-yü, with
LINE 26: concealed shame.
LINE 27: "What did you dream of?" inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried to
LINE 28: stifle her blushes, "and whence comes all this perspiration?"
LINE 29: "It's a long story," said Pao-yü, "which only a few words will not
LINE 30: suffice to explain."
LINE 31: He accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of his
LINE 32: dream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him the
LINE 33: mysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered her
LINE 34: face with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit of
LINE 35: laughter. Pao-yü had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of her
LINE 36: gentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and he
LINE 37: forthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by the
LINE 38: Fairy.
LINE 39: Hsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given her
LINE 40: over to Pao-yü, so that her present behaviour was likewise no
LINE 41: transgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-yü a
LINE 42: violent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them during
LINE 43: their tête-à-tête. From this date, Pao-yü treated Hsi Jen with special
LINE 44: regard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jen
LINE 45: herself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-yü. But
LINE 46: for a time we will make no further remark about them.
LINE 47: As regards the household of the Jung mansion, the inmates may, on adding
LINE 48: up the total number, not have been found many; yet, counting the high as
LINE 49: well as the low, there were three hundred persons and more. Their
LINE 50: affairs may not have been very numerous, still there were, every day,
LINE 51: ten and twenty matters to settle; in fact, the household resembled, in
LINE 52: every way, ravelled hemp, devoid even of a clue-end, which could be used
LINE 53: as an introduction.
LINE 54: Just as we were considering what matter and what person it would be best
LINE 55: to begin writing of, by a lucky coincidence suddenly from a distance of
LINE 56: a thousand li, a person small and insignificant as a grain of mustard
LINE 57: seed happened, on account of her distant relationship with the Jung
LINE 58: family, to come on this very day to the Jung mansion on a visit. We
LINE 59: shall therefore readily commence by speaking of this family, as it after
LINE 60: all affords an excellent clue for a beginning.
LINE 61: The surname of this mean and humble family was in point of fact Wang.
LINE 62: They were natives of this district. Their ancestor had filled a minor
LINE 63: office in the capital, and had, in years gone by, been acquainted with
LINE 64: lady Feng's grandfather, that is madame Wang's father. Being covetous of
LINE 65: the influence and affluence of the Wang family, he consequently joined
LINE 66: ancestors with them, and was recognised by them as a nephew.
LINE 67: At that time, there were only madame Wang's eldest brother, that is lady
LINE 68: Feng's father, and madame Wang herself, who knew anything of these
LINE 69: distant relations, from the fact of having followed their parents to the
LINE 70: capital. The rest of the family had one and all no idea about them.
LINE 71: This ancestor had, at this date, been dead long ago, leaving only one
LINE 72: son called Wang Ch'eng. As the family estate was in a state of ruin, he
LINE 73: once more moved outside the city walls and settled down in his native
LINE 74: village. Wang Ch'eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son,
LINE 75: known in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he had
LINE 76: a son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter,
LINE 77: Ch'ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living from
LINE 78: farming.
LINE 79: As Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day and
LINE 80: his wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the rice
LINE 81: and attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister,
LINE 82: Ch'ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them.
LINE 83: (Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goody
LINE 84: Liu, to live with them.
LINE 85: This goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She had
LINE 86: besides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for her
LINE 87: maintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that when
LINE 88: her son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willing
LINE 89: to exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earn
LINE 90: their living.
LINE 91: This year, the autumn had come to an end, winter had commenced, and the
LINE 92: weather had begun to be quite cold. No provision had been made in the
LINE 93: household for the winter months, and Kou Erh was, inevitably,
LINE 94: exceedingly exercised in his heart. Having had several cups of wine to
LINE 95: dispel his distress, he sat at home and tried to seize upon every trifle
LINE 96: to give vent to his displeasure. His wife had not the courage to force
LINE 97: herself in his way, and hence goody Liu it was who encouraged him, as
LINE 98: she could not bear to see the state of the domestic affairs.
LINE 99: "Don't pull me up for talking too much," she said; "but who of us
LINE 100: country people isn't honest and open-hearted? As the size of the bowl we
LINE 101: hold, so is the quantity of the rice we eat. In your young days, you
LINE 102: were dependent on the support of your old father, so that eating and
LINE 103: drinking became quite a habit with you; that's how, at the present time,
LINE 104: your resources are quite uncertain; when you had money, you looked
LINE 105: ahead, and didn't mind behind; and now that you have no money, you
LINE 106: blindly fly into huffs. A fine fellow and a capital hero you have made!
LINE 107: Living though we now be away from the capital, we are after all at the
LINE 108: feet of the Emperor; this city of Ch'ang Ngan is strewn all over with
LINE 109: money, but the pity is that there's no one able to go and fetch it away;
LINE 110: and it's no use your staying at home and kicking your feet about."
LINE 111: "All you old lady know," rejoined Kou Erh, after he had heard what she
LINE 112: had to say, "is to sit on the couch and talk trash! Is it likely you
LINE 113: would have me go and play the robber?"
LINE 114: "Who tells you to become a robber?" asked goody Liu. "But it would be
LINE 115: well, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise some
LINE 116: means; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into our
LINE 117: house?"
LINE 118: "Had there been a way," observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, "would
LINE 119: I have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors as
LINE 120: relatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could we
LINE 121: devise? 'But even had I any, they wouldn't be likely, I fear, to pay any
LINE 122: heed to such as ourselves!"
LINE 123: "That, too, doesn't follow," remarked goody Liu; "the planning of
LINE 124: affairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests with
LINE 125: Heaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying on
LINE 126: the sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it to
LINE 127: me, I'll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years gone
LINE 128: by, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twenty
LINE 129: years back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you've
LINE 130: been so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them,
LINE 131: that an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I and
LINE 132: my daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family was
LINE 133: really so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness,
LINE 134: and without in fact any high airs! She's at present the wife of Mr.
LINE 135: Chia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say that
LINE 136: now that she's advanced in years, she's still more considerate to the
LINE 137: poor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable food
LINE 138: for the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wang
LINE 139: mansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, but
LINE 140: I hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then that
LINE 141: you don't find your way as far as there; for she may possibly remember
LINE 142: old times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wish
LINE 143: that she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hair
LINE 144: from her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist."
LINE 145: "What you suggest, mother, is quite correct," interposed Mrs. Liu, Kou
LINE 146: Erh's wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, "but with such
LINE 147: mouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves before
LINE 148: her door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won't also like to go and
LINE 149: announce us! and we'd better not go and have our mouths slapped in
LINE 150: public!"
LINE 151: Kou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence and
LINE 152: fame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel at
LINE 153: heart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife had
LINE 154: to say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled.
LINE 155: "Old mother," he rejoined; "since that be your idea, and what's more,
LINE 156: you have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn't
LINE 157: you, old lady, start to-morrow on a visit to her and first ascertain how
LINE 158: the wind blows!"
LINE 159: "Ai Ya!" exclaimed old Goody, "It may very well be said that the
LINE 160: marquis' door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why the
LINE 161: servants of that family wouldn't even recognise me! even were I to go,
LINE 162: it would be on a wild goose chase."
LINE 163: "No matter about that," observed Kou Erh; "I'll tell you a good way; you
LINE 164: just take along with you, your grandson, little Pan Erh, and go first
LINE 165: and call upon Chou Jui, who is attached to that household; and when once
LINE 166: you've seen him, there will be some little chance. This Chou Jui, at one
LINE 167: time, was connected with my father in some affair or other, and we were
LINE 168: on excellent terms with him."
LINE 169: "That I too know," replied goody Liu, "but the thing is that you've had
LINE 170: no dealings with him for so long, that who knows how he's disposed
LINE 171: towards us now? this would be hard to say. Besides, you're a man, and
LINE 172: with a mouth and phiz like that of yours, you couldn't, on any account,
LINE 173: go on this errand. My daughter is a young woman, and she too couldn't
LINE 174: very well go and expose herself to public gaze. But by my sacrificing
LINE 175: this old face of mine, and by going and knocking it (against the wall)
LINE 176: there may, after all, be some benefit and all of us might reap profit."
LINE 177: That very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morning
LINE 178: before the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and having
LINE 179: performed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who,
LINE 180: being a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that he
LINE 181: was to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there was
LINE 182: nothing that he would not agree to.
LINE 183: Without further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city,
LINE 184: and reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of the
LINE 185: Jung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowd
LINE 186: of chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage to
LINE 187: go by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonable
LINE 188: words to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate,
LINE 189: whence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests,
LINE 190: pushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kicking
LINE 191: their feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chattering
LINE 192: about one thing and another.
LINE 193: Goody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. "Gentlemen," she
LINE 194: ventured, "may happiness betide you!"
LINE 195: The whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. "Where do you
LINE 196: come from?" they at length inquired.
LINE 197: "I've come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady's," remarked
LINE 198: goody Liu, as she forced a smile; "which of you, gentlemen, shall I
LINE 199: trouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?"
LINE 200: The servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole number
LINE 201: of them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerable
LINE 202: time that they suggested: "Go and wait at a distance, at the foot of
LINE 203: that wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house,
LINE 204: will be coming out."
LINE 205: Among the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed,
LINE 206: "Don't baffle her object," he expostulated; "why make a fool of her?"
LINE 207: and turning to goody Liu: "This Mr. Chou," he said, "is gone south: his
LINE 208: house is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round this
LINE 209: way, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you will
LINE 210: ask about her, you will be on the right track."
LINE 211: Goody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erh
LINE 212: by the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlars
LINE 213: resting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, and
LINE 214: those who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirty
LINE 215: boys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise.
LINE 216: Goody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. "I'd like to ask you just
LINE 217: a word, my young friend," she observed; "there's a Mrs. Chou here; is
LINE 218: she at home?"
LINE 219: "Which Mrs. Chou?" inquired the boy; "we here have three Mrs. Chous; and
LINE 220: there are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What are
LINE 221: the duties of the one you want, I wonder ?"
LINE 222: "She's a waiting-woman of my lady," replied goody Liu.
LINE 223: "It's easy to get at her," added the boy; "just come along with me."
LINE 224: Leading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wall
LINE 225: of a court, when he pointed and said, "This is her house.--Mother Chou!"
LINE 226: he went on to shout with alacrity; "there's an old lady who wants to see
LINE 227: you."
LINE 228: Chou Jui's wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greet
LINE 229: her visitor. "Who is it?" she asked.
LINE 230: Goody Liu advanced up to her. "How are you," she inquired, "Mrs. Chou?"
LINE 231: Mrs. Chou looked at her for some time before she at length smiled and
LINE 232: replied, "Old goody Liu, are you well? How many years is it since we've
LINE 233: seen each other; tell me, for I forget just now; but please come in and
LINE 234: sit."
LINE 235: "You're a lady of rank," answered goody Liu smiling, as she walked
LINE 236: along, "and do forget many things. How could you remember such as
LINE 237: ourselves?"
LINE 238: With these words still in her mouth, they had entered the house,
LINE 239: whereupon Mrs. Chou ordered a hired waiting-maid to pour the tea. While
LINE 240: they were having their tea she remarked, "How Pan Erh has managed to
LINE 241: grow!" and then went on to make inquiries on the subject of various
LINE 242: matters, which had occurred after their separation.
LINE 243: "To-day," she also asked of goody Liu, "were you simply passing by? or
LINE 244: did you come with any express object?"
LINE 245: "I've come, the fact is, with an object!" promptly replied goody Liu;
LINE 246: "(first of all) to see you, my dear sister-in-law; and, in the second
LINE 247: place also, to inquire after my lady's health. If you could introduce me
LINE 248: to see her for a while, it would be better; but if you can't, I must
LINE 249: readily borrow your good offices, my sister-in-law, to convey my
LINE 250: message."
LINE 251: Mr. Chou Jui's wife, after listening to these words, at once became to a
LINE 252: great extent aware of the object of her visit. Her husband had, however,
LINE 253: in years gone by in his attempt to purchase some land, obtained
LINE 254: considerably the support of Kou Erh, so that when she, on this occasion,
LINE 255: saw goody Liu in such a dilemma, she could not make up her mind to
LINE 256: refuse her wish. Being in the second place keen upon making a display of
LINE 257: her own respectability, she therefore said smilingly:
LINE 258: "Old goody Liu, pray compose your mind! You've come from far off with a
LINE 259: pure heart and honest purpose, and how can I ever not show you the way
LINE 260: how to see this living Buddha? Properly speaking, when people come and
LINE 261: guests arrive, and verbal messages have to be given, these matters are
LINE 262: not any of my business, as we all here have each one kind of duties to
LINE 263: carry out. My husband has the special charge of the rents of land coming
LINE 264: in, during the two seasons of spring and autumn, and when at leisure, he
LINE 265: takes the young gentlemen out of doors, and then his business is done.
LINE 266: As for myself, I have to accompany my lady and young married ladies on
LINE 267: anything connected with out-of-doors; but as you are a relative of my
LINE 268: lady and have besides treated me as a high person and come to me for
LINE 269: help, I'll, after all, break this custom and deliver your message.
LINE 270: There's only one thing, however, and which you, old lady, don't know. We
LINE 271: here are not what we were five years before. My lady now doesn't much
LINE 272: worry herself about anything; and it's entirely lady Secunda who looks
LINE 273: after the menage. But who do you presume is this lady Secunda? She's the
LINE 274: niece of my lady, and the daughter of my master, the eldest maternal
LINE 275: uncle of by-gone days. Her infant name was Feng Ko."
LINE 276: "Is it really she?" inquired promptly goody Liu, after this explanation.
LINE 277: "Isn't it strange? what I said about her years back has come out quite
LINE 278: correct; but from all you say, shall I to-day be able to see her?"
LINE 279: "That goes without saying," replied Chou Jui's wife; "when any visitors
LINE 280: come now-a-days, it's always lady Feng who does the honours and
LINE 281: entertains them, and it's better to-day that you should see her for a
LINE 282: while, for then you will not have walked all this way to no purpose."
LINE 283: "O mi to fu!" exclaimed old goody Liu; "I leave it entirely to your
LINE 284: convenience, sister-in-law."
LINE 285: "What's that you're saying?" observed Chou Jui's wife. "The proverb
LINE 286: says: 'Our convenience is the convenience of others.' All I have to do
LINE 287: is to just utter one word, and what trouble will that be to me."
LINE 288: Saying this, she bade the young waiting maid go to the side pavilion,
LINE 289: and quietly ascertain whether, in her old ladyship's apartment, table
LINE 290: had been laid.
LINE 291: The young waiting-maid went on this errand, and during this while, the
LINE 292: two of them continued a conversation on certain irrelevant matters.
LINE 293: "This lady Feng," observed goody Liu, "can this year be no older than
LINE 294: twenty, and yet so talented as to manage such a household as this! the
LINE 295: like of her is not easy to find!"
LINE 296: "Hai! my dear old goody," said Chou Jui's wife, after listening to her,
LINE 297: "it's not easy to explain; but this lady Feng, though young in years, is
LINE 298: nevertheless, in the management of affairs, superior to any man. She has
LINE 299: now excelled the others and developed the very features of a beautiful
LINE 300: young woman. To say the least, she has ten thousand eyes in her heart,
LINE 301: and were they willing to wager their mouths, why ten men gifted with
LINE 302: eloquence couldn't even outdo her! But by and bye, when you've seen her,
LINE 303: you'll know all about her! There's only this thing, she can't help being
LINE 304: rather too severe in her treatment of those below her."
LINE 305: While yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. "In her venerable
LINE 306: lady's apartment," she reported, "repast has been spread, and already
LINE 307: finished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang's chamber."
LINE 308: As soon as Chou Jui's wife heard this news, she speedily got up and
LINE 309: pressed goody Liu to be off at once. "This is," she urged, "just the
LINE 310: hour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and wait
LINE 311: for her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servants
LINE 312: will come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak to
LINE 313: her; and after her siesta, she'll have still less time to herself."
LINE 314: As she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together.
LINE 315: Goody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more words
LINE 316: of advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui's wife through winding
LINE 317: passages to Chia Lien's house. They came in the first instance into the
LINE 318: side pavilion, where Chou Jui's wife placed old goody Liu to wait a
LINE 319: little, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into the
LINE 320: entrance of the court.
LINE 321: Hearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of an
LINE 322: elderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P'ing Erh by name, who enjoyed her
LINE 323: confidence, to whom Chou Jui's wife first recounted from beginning to
LINE 324: end the history of old goody Liu.
LINE 325: "She has come to-day," she went on to explain, "from a distance to pay
LINE 326: her obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, so
LINE 327: that, on this occasion, she can't but receive her; and this is why I've
LINE 328: brought her in! I'll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explain
LINE 329: everything to her; and I trust she'll not call me to task for officious
LINE 330: rudeness."
LINE 331: P'ing Erh, after hearing what she had to say, speedily devised the plan
LINE 332: of asking them to walk in, and to sit there pending (lady Feng's
LINE 333: arrival), when all would be right.
LINE 334: Chou Jui's wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascended
LINE 335: the steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a red
LINE 336: woollen portière, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt a
LINE 337: whiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent was
LINE 338: they could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they were
LINE 339: among the clouds.
LINE 340: The articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all so
LINE 341: brilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made the
LINE 342: head to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing else
LINE 343: the while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwith
LINE 344: she was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where was
LINE 345: the bedroom of Chia Lien's eldest daughter. P'ing Erh, who was standing
LINE 346: by the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goody
LINE 347: Liu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her to
LINE 348: have a seat.
LINE 349: Goody Liu, noticing that P'ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that she
LINE 350: had gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure,
LINE 351: and that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty),
LINE 352: readily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as my
LINE 353: lady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P'ing, and P'ing
LINE 354: Erh promptly address Chou Jui's wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually became
LINE 355: aware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certain
LINE 356: respectability.
LINE 357: She at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on the
LINE 358: stove-couch. P'ing Erh and Chou Jui's wife sat face to face, on the
LINE 359: edges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea. After they had
LINE 360: partaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a "lo tang, lo
LINE 361: tang" noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowing
LINE 362: flour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to the
LINE 363: West. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, a
LINE 364: box at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance,
LINE 365: which incessantly wagged to and fro.
LINE 366: "What can this thing be?" communed goody Liu in her heart, "What can be
LINE 367: its use?" While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of "tang"
LINE 368: like the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite a
LINE 369: start. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutive
LINE 370: strokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caught
LINE 371: sight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. "Our lady has
LINE 372: come down!" they announced.
LINE 373: P'ìng Erh, together with Chou Jui's wife, rose with all haste. "Old
LINE 374: goody Liu," they urged, "do sit down and wait till it's time, when we'll
LINE 375: come and ask you in."
LINE 376: Saying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.
LINE 377: Old goody Liu, with suppressed voice and ear intent, waited in perfect
LINE 378: silence. She heard at a distance the voices of some people laughing,
LINE 379: whereupon about ten or twenty women, with rustling clothes and
LINE 380: petticoats, made their entrance, one by one, into the hall, and thence
LINE 381: into the room on the other quarter. She also detected two or three
LINE 382: women, with red-lacquered boxes in their hands, come over on this part
LINE 383: and remain in waiting.
LINE 384: "Get the repast ready!" she heard some one from the offside say.
LINE 385: The servants gradually dispersed and went out; and there only remained
LINE 386: in attendance a few of them to bring in the courses. For a long time,
LINE 387: not so much as the caw of a crow could be heard, when she unexpectedly
LINE 388: perceived two servants carry in a couch-table, and lay it on this side
LINE 389: of the divan. Upon this table were placed bowls and plates, in proper
LINE 390: order replete, as usual, with fish and meats; but of these only a few
LINE 391: kinds were slightly touched.
LINE 392: As soon as Pan Erh perceived (all these delicacies), he set up such a
LINE 393: noise, and would have some meat to eat, but goody Liu administered to
LINE 394: him such a slap, that he had to keep away.
LINE 395: Suddenly, she saw Mrs. Chou approach, full of smiles, and as she waved
LINE 396: her hand, she called her. Goody Liu understood her meaning, and at once
LINE 397: pulling Pan Erh off the couch, she proceeded to the centre of the Hall;
LINE 398: and after Mrs. Chou had whispered to her again for a while, they came at
LINE 399: length with slow step into the room on this side, where they saw on the
LINE 400: outside of the door, suspended by brass hooks, a deep red flowered soft
LINE 401: portière. Below the window, on the southern side, was a stove-couch, and
LINE 402: on this couch was spread a crimson carpet. Leaning against the wooden
LINE 403: partition wall, on the east side, stood a chain-embroidered back-cushion
LINE 404: and a reclining pillow. There was also spread a large watered satin
LINE 405: sitting cushion with a gold embroidered centre, and on the side stood
LINE 406: cuspidores made of silver.
LINE 407: Lady Feng, when at home, usually wore on her head a front-piece of dark
LINE 408: martin à la Chao Chün, surrounded with tassels of strung pearls. She had
LINE 409: on a robe of peach-red flowered satin, a short pelisse of slate-blue
LINE 410: stiff silk, lined with squirrel, and a jupe of deep red foreign crepe,
LINE 411: lined with ermine. Resplendent with pearl-powder and with cosmetics, she
LINE 412: sat in there, stately and majestic, with a small brass poker in her
LINE 413: hands, with which she was stirring the ashes of the hand-stove. P'ing
LINE 414: Erh stood by the side of the couch, holding a very small lacquered
LINE 415: tea-tray. In this tray was a small tea-cup with a cover. Lady Feng
LINE 416: neither took any tea, nor did she raise her head, but was intent upon
LINE 417: stirring the ashes of the hand-stove.
LINE 418: "How is it you haven't yet asked her to come in?" she slowly inquired;
LINE 419: and as she spake, she turned herself round and was about to ask for some
LINE 420: tea, when she perceived that Mrs. Chou had already introduced the two
LINE 421: persons and that they were standing in front of her.
LINE 422: She forthwith pretended to rise, but did not actually get up, and with a
LINE 423: face radiant with smiles, she ascertained about their health, after
LINE 424: which she went in to chide Chou Jui's wife. "Why didn't you tell me they
LINE 425: had come before?" she said.
LINE 426: Old goody Liu was already by this time prostrated on the ground, and
LINE 427: after making several obeisances, "How are you, my lady?" she inquired.
LINE 428: "Dear Mrs. Chou," lady Feng immediately observed, "do pull her up, and
LINE 429: don't let her prostrate herself! I'm yet young in years and don't know
LINE 430: her much; what's more, I've no idea what's the degree of the
LINE 431: relationship between us, and I daren't speak directly to her."
LINE 432: "This is the old lady about whom I spoke a short while back," speedily
LINE 433: explained Mrs. Chou.
LINE 434: Lady Feng nodded her head assentingly.
LINE 435: By this time old goody Liu had taken a seat on the edge of the
LINE 436: stove-couch. As for Pan Erh, he had gone further, and taken refuge
LINE 437: behind her back; and though she tried, by every means, to coax him to
LINE 438: come forward and make a bow, he would not, for the life of him, consent.
LINE 439: "Relatives though we be," remarked lady Feng, as she smiled, "we haven't
LINE 440: seen much of each other, so that our relations have been quite distant.
LINE 441: But those who know how matters stand will assert that you all despise
LINE 442: us, and won't often come to look us up; while those mean people, who
LINE 443: don't know the truth, will imagine that we have no eyes to look at any
LINE 444: one."
LINE 445: Old goody Liu promptly invoked Buddha. "We are at home in great
LINE 446: straits," she pleaded, "and that's why it wasn't easy for us to manage
LINE 447: to get away and come! Even supposing we had come as far as this, had we
LINE 448: not given your ladyship a slap on the mouth, those gentlemen would also,
LINE 449: in point of fact, have looked down upon us as a mean lot."
LINE 450: "Why, language such as this," exclaimed lady Feng smilingly, "cannot
LINE 451: help making one's heart full of displeasure! We simply rely upon the
LINE 452: reputation of our grandfather to maintain the status of a penniless
LINE 453: official; that's all! Why, in whose household is there anything
LINE 454: substantial? we are merely the denuded skeleton of what we were in days
LINE 455: of old, and no more! As the proverb has it: The Emperor himself has
LINE 456: three families of poverty-stricken relatives; and how much more such as
LINE 457: you and I?"
LINE 458: Having passed these remarks, she inquired of Mrs. Chou, "Have you let
LINE 459: madame know, yes or no?"
LINE 460: "We are now waiting," replied Mrs. Chou, "for my lady's orders."
LINE 461: "Go and have a look," said lady Feng; "but, should there be any one
LINE 462: there, or should she be busy, then don't make any mention; but wait
LINE 463: until she's free, when you can tell her about it and see what she says."
LINE 464: Chou Jui's wife, having expressed her compliance, went off on this
LINE 465: errand. During her absence, lady Feng gave orders to some servants to
LINE 466: take a few fruits and hand them to Pan Erh to eat; and she was inquiring
LINE 467: about one thing and another, when there came a large number of married
LINE 468: women, who had the direction of affairs in the household, to make their
LINE 469: several reports.
LINE 470: P'ing Erh announced their arrival to lady Feng, who said: "I'm now
LINE 471: engaged in entertaining some guests, so let them come back again in the
LINE 472: evening; but should there be anything pressing then bring it in and I'll
LINE 473: settle it at once."
LINE 474: P'ing Erh left the room, but she returned in a short while. "I've asked
LINE 475: them," she observed, "but as there's nothing of any urgency, I told them
LINE 476: to disperse." Lady Feng nodded her head in token of approval, when she
LINE 477: perceived Chou Jui's wife come back. "Our lady," she reported, as she
LINE 478: addressed lady Feng, "says that she has no leisure to-day, that if you,
LINE 479: lady Secunda, will entertain them, it will come to the same thing; that
LINE 480: she's much obliged for their kind attention in going to the trouble of
LINE 481: coming; that if they have come simply on a stroll, then well and good,
LINE 482: but that if they have aught to say, they should tell you, lady Secunda,
LINE 483: which will be tantamount to their telling her."
LINE 484: "I've nothing to say," interposed old goody Liu. "I simply come to see
LINE 485: our elder and our younger lady, which is a duty on my part, a relative
LINE 486: as I am."
LINE 487: "Well, if there's nothing particular that you've got to say, all right,"
LINE 488: Mrs. Chou forthwith added, "but if you do have anything, don't hesitate
LINE 489: telling lady Secunda, and it will be just as if you had told our lady."
LINE 490: As she uttered these words, she winked at goody Liu. Goody Liu
LINE 491: understood what she meant, but before she could give vent to a word, her
LINE 492: face got scarlet, and though she would have liked not to make any
LINE 493: mention of the object of her visit, she felt constrained to suppress her
LINE 494: shame and to speak out.
LINE 495: "Properly speaking," she observed, "this being the first time I see you,
LINE 496: my lady, I shouldn't mention what I've to say, but as I come here from
LINE 497: far off to seek your assistance, my old friend, I have no help but to
LINE 498: mention it."
LINE 499: She had barely spoken as much as this, when she heard the youths at the
LINE 500: inner-door cry out: "The young gentleman from the Eastern Mansion has
LINE 501: come."
LINE 502: Lady Feng promptly interrupted her. "Old goody Liu," she remarked, "you
LINE 503: needn't add anything more." She, at the same time, inquired, "Where's
LINE 504: your master, Mr. Jung?" when became audible the sound of footsteps along
LINE 505: the way, and in walked a young man of seventeen or eighteen. His
LINE 506: appearance was handsome, his person slender and graceful. He had on
LINE 507: light furs, a girdle of value, costly clothes and a beautiful cap.
LINE 508: At this stage, goody Liu did not know whether it was best to sit down or
LINE 509: to stand up, neither could she find anywhere to hide herself.
LINE 510: "Pray sit down," urged lady Feng, with a laugh; "this is my nephew!' Old
LINE 511: goody Liu then wriggled herself, now one way, and then another, on to
LINE 512: the edge of the couch, where she took a seat.
LINE 513: "My father," Chia Jung smilingly ventured, "has sent me to ask a favour
LINE 514: of you, aunt. On some previous occasion, our grand aunt gave you, dear
LINE 515: aunt, a stove-couch glass screen, and as to-morrow father has invited
LINE 516: some guests of high standing, he wishes to borrow it to lay it out for a
LINE 517: little show; after which he purposes sending it back again."
LINE 518: "You're late by a day," replied lady Feng. "It was only yesterday that I
LINE 519: gave it to some one."
LINE 520: Chia Jung, upon hearing this, forthwith, with giggles and smiles, made,
LINE 521: near the edge of the couch, a sort of genuflexion. "Aunt," he went on,
LINE 522: "if you don't lend it, father will again say that I don't know how to
LINE 523: speak, and I shall get another sound thrashing. You must have pity upon
LINE 524: your nephew, aunt."
LINE 525: "I've never seen anything like this," observed lady Feng sneeringly;
LINE 526: "the things belonging to the Wang family are all good, but where have
LINE 527: you put all those things of yours? the only good way is that you
LINE 528: shouldn't see anything of ours, for as soon as you catch sight of
LINE 529: anything, you at once entertain a wish to carry it off."
LINE 530: "Pray, aunt," entreated Chia Jung with a smile, "do show me some
LINE 531: compassion."
LINE 532: "Mind your skin!" lady Feng warned him, "if you do chip or spoil it in
LINE 533: the least."
LINE 534: She then bade P'ing Erh take the keys of the door of the upstairs room
LINE 535: and send for several trustworthy persons to carry it away.
LINE 536: Chia Jung was so elated that his eyebrows dilated and his eyes smiled.
LINE 537: "I've brought myself," he added, with vehemence, "some men to take it
LINE 538: away; I won't let them recklessly bump it about."
LINE 539: Saying this, he speedily got up and left the room.
LINE 540: Lady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towards
LINE 541: the window, she called out, "Jung Erh, come back." Several servants who
LINE 542: stood outside caught up her words: "Mr. Jung," they cried, "you're
LINE 543: requested to go back;" whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced his
LINE 544: steps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stood
LINE 545: ready to listen to his aunt's wishes.
LINE 546: Lady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after a
LINE 547: good long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: "Never mind," she
LINE 548: remarked; "you can go. But come after you've had your evening meal, and
LINE 549: I'll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; and
LINE 550: besides, I don't feel in the humour."
LINE 551: Chia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step.
LINE 552: Old goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart. "I've
LINE 553: to-day brought your nephew," she then explained, "not for anything else,
LINE 554: but because his father and mother haven't at home so much as anything to
LINE 555: eat; the weather besides is already cold, so that I had no help but to
LINE 556: take your nephew along and come to you, old friend, for assistance!"
LINE 557: As she uttered these words, she again pushed Pan Erh forward. "What did
LINE 558: your father at home tell you to say?" she asked of him; "and what did he
LINE 559: send us over here to do? Was it only to give our minds to eating fruit?"
LINE 560: Lady Feng had long ago understood what she meant to convey, and finding
LINE 561: that she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, she
LINE 562: readily interrupted her with a smile. "You needn't mention anything,"
LINE 563: she observed, "I'm well aware of how things stand;" and addressing
LINE 564: herself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, "Has this old lady had breakfast,
LINE 565: yes or no?"
LINE 566: Old goody Liu hurried to explain. "As soon as it was daylight," she
LINE 567: proceeded, "we started with all speed on our way here, and had we even
LINE 568: so much as time to have any breakfast?"
LINE 569: Lady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a short
LINE 570: while Chou Jui's wife had called for a table of viands for the guests,
LINE 571: which was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take
LINE 572: goody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.
LINE 573: "My dear Mrs. Chou," enjoined lady Feng, "give them all they want, as I
LINE 574: can't attend to them myself;" which said, they hastily passed over into
LINE 575: the room on the eastern side.
LINE 576: Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: "When you first
LINE 577: informed madame about them, what did she say?" "Our Lady observed,"
LINE 578: replied Chou Jui's wife, "that they don't really belong to the same
LINE 579: family; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the
LINE 580: same place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined
LINE 581: ancestors; that these few years there hasn't been much intercourse
LINE 582: (between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they
LINE 583: came on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that
LINE 584: as their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on
LINE 585: their part, they shouldn't be slighted. If they've anything to say,"
LINE 586: (our lady continued), "tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that
LINE 587: will be right."
LINE 588: "Isn't it strange!" exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard the
LINE 589: message; "since we are all one family, how is it I'm not familiar even
LINE 590: with so much as their shadow?"
LINE 591: While she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast and
LINE 592: come over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking her
LINE 593: mouth, she expressed her thanks.
LINE 594: Lady Feng smiled. "Do pray sit down," she said, "and listen to what I'm
LINE 595: going to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back to
LINE 596: convey, I'm already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives,
LINE 597: as we are, we shouldn't in fact have waited until you came to the
LINE 598: threshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended to
LINE 599: your needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs are
LINE 600: exceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is,
LINE 601: couldn't at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all!
LINE 602: What's more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, I
LINE 603: myself didn't know of all these family connections! Besides, though to
LINE 604: look at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect,
LINE 605: people aren't aware that large establishments have such great hardships,
LINE 606: which, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit as
LINE 607: true. But since you've now come from a great distance, and this is the
LINE 608: first occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I very
LINE 609: well allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a lucky
LINE 610: coincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taels
LINE 611: to make clothes with, a sum which they haven't as yet touched, and if
LINE 612: you don't despise it as too little, you may take it home as a first
LINE 613: instalment, and employ it for your wants."
LINE 614: When old goody Liu heard the mention made by lady Feng of their
LINE 615: hardships, she imagined that there was no hope; but upon hearing her
LINE 616: again speak of giving her twenty taels, she was exceedingly delighted,
LINE 617: so much so that her eyebrows dilated and her eyes gleamed with smiles.
LINE 618: "We too know," she smilingly remarked, "all about difficulties! but the
LINE 619: proverb says, 'A camel dying of leanness is even bigger by much than a
LINE 620: horse!' No matter what those distresses may be, were you yet to pluck
LINE 621: one single hair from your body, my old friend, it would be stouter than
LINE 622: our own waist."
LINE 623: Chou Jui's wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarse
LINE 624: utterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, and
LINE 625: make her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P'ing
LINE 626: Erh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given to
LINE 627: them the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and when
LINE 628: these had been placed before goody Liu's eyes: "This is," said lady
LINE 629: Feng, "silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the time
LINE 630: given to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some other
LINE 631: day, when you've nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence of
LINE 632: the good feeling which should exist between relatives. It's besides
LINE 633: already late, and I don't wish to detain you longer and all for no
LINE 634: purpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all those
LINE 635: of yours to whom I should send them."
LINE 636: As she spake, she stood up. Old goody Liu gave utterance to a thousand
LINE 637: and ten thousand expressions of gratitude, and taking the silver and
LINE 638: cash, she followed Chou Jui's wife on her way to the out-houses. "Well,
LINE 639: mother dear," inquired Mrs. Chou, "what did you think of my lady that
LINE 640: you couldn't speak; and that whenever you opened your mouth it was all
LINE 641: 'your nephew.' I'll make just one remark, and I don't mind if you do get
LINE 642: angry. Had he even been your kindred nephew, you should in fact have
LINE 643: been somewhat milder in your language; for that gentleman, Mr. Jung, is
LINE 644: her kith and kin nephew, and whence has appeared such another nephew of
LINE 645: hers (as Pan Erh)?"
LINE 646: Old goody Liu smiled. "My dear sister-in-law," she replied, "as I gazed
LINE 647: upon her, were my heart and eyes, pray, full of admiration or not? and
LINE 648: how then could I speak as I should?"
LINE 649: As they were chatting, they reached Chou Jui's house. They had been
LINE 650: sitting for a while, when old goody Liu produced a piece of silver,
LINE 651: which she was purposing to leave behind, to be given to the young
LINE 652: servants in Chou Jui's house to purchase fruit to eat; but how could
LINE 653: Mrs. Chou satiate her eye with such a small piece of silver? She was
LINE 654: determined in her refusal to accept it, so that old goody Liu, after
LINE 655: assuring her of her boundless gratitude, took her departure out of the
LINE 656: back gate she had come in from.
LINE 657: Reader, you do not know what happened after old goody Liu left, but
LINE 658: listen to the explanation which will be given in the next chapter.
