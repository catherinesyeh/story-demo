LINE 1: Lin Ju-hai dies in the City of Yang Chou.
LINE 2: Chia Pao-y√º meets the Prince of Pei Ching on the way.
LINE 3: When Lai Sheng, be it noticed in continuing our story, the major-domo in
LINE 4: the Ning Kuo mansion, came to hear that from inside an invitation had
LINE 5: been extended to lady Feng to act as deputy, he summoned together his
LINE 6: co-workers and other servants. "Lady Secunda, of the western mansion,"
LINE 7: he harangued them, "has now been asked to take over the control of
LINE 8: internal affairs; and should she come we must, when we apply for
LINE 9: anything, or have anything to say, be circumspect in our service; we
LINE 10: should all every day come early and leave late; and it's better that we
LINE 11: should exert ourselves during this one month and take rest after it's
LINE 12: over. We mustn't throw away our old 'face,' for she's well known to be
LINE 13: an impetuous thing, with a soured face and a hard heart, who, when
LINE 14: angry, knows no distinction of persons."
LINE 15: The whole company unanimously admitted that he was right; and one of
LINE 16: their number too observed smilingly, "It's but right that for the inner
LINE 17: apartments, we should, in fact, get her to come and put things in proper
LINE 18: order, as everything is very much what it should not be."
LINE 19: But while he uttered these words, they saw Lai Wang's wife coming, with
LINE 20: an indent in hand, to fetch paper for the supplications and prayers, the
LINE 21: amount of which was mentioned on the order; and they one and all
LINE 22: hastened to press her into a seat, and to help her to a cup of tea;
LINE 23: while a servant was told to fetch the quantity of paper required. (When
LINE 24: it was brought,) Lai Wang carried it in his arms and came, the whole way
LINE 25: with his wife, as far as the ceremonial gate; when he, at length,
LINE 26: delivered it over to her and she clasped it, and walked into the room
LINE 27: all alone.
LINE 28: Lady Feng issued prompt directions to Ts'ai Ming to prepare a register;
LINE 29: and sending, there and then, for Lai Sheng's wife, she asked her to
LINE 30: submit, for her perusal, the roll with the servants' names. She
LINE 31: furthermore fixed upon an early hour of the following day to convene the
LINE 32: domestics and their wives in the mansion, in order that they should
LINE 33: receive their orders; but, after cursorily glancing over the number of
LINE 34: entries in the list, and making a few inquiries of Lai Sheng's wife, she
LINE 35: soon got into her curricle, and went home.
LINE 36: On the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over. The
LINE 37: matrons and married women of the Ning Kuo mansion assembled together, as
LINE 38: soon as they heard of her arrival; but, perceiving lady Feng, assisted
LINE 39: by Lai Sheng's wife, engaged in apportioning the duties of each servant,
LINE 40: they could not presume to intrude, but remained outside the window
LINE 41: listening to what was going on.
LINE 42: "As I've been asked to take over the charge," they heard lady Feng
LINE 43: explain to Lai Sheng's wife, "I'm, needless to say, sure to incur the
LINE 44: displeasure of you all, for I can't compare with your mistress, who has
LINE 45: such a sweet temper, and allows you to have your own way. But saying
LINE 46: nothing more of those ways, which prevailed hitherto among your people
LINE 47: in this mansion, you must now do as I tell you; for on the slightest
LINE 48: disregard of my orders, I shall, with no discrimination between those
LINE 49: who may be respectable and those who may not be, clearly and distinctly
LINE 50: call all alike to account."
LINE 51: Having concluded these remarks, she went on to order Ts'ai Ming to read
LINE 52: the roll; and, as their names were uttered, one by one was called in,
LINE 53: and passed under inspection. After this inspection, which was got over
LINE 54: in a short time, she continued giving further directions. "These
LINE 55: twenty," she said "should be divided into two companies; ten in each
LINE 56: company, whose sole daily duties should be to attend inside to the
LINE 57: guests, coming and going, and to serve tea for them; while with any
LINE 58: other matters, they needn't have anything to do. These other twenty
LINE 59: should also be divided into two companies, whose exclusive duties will
LINE 60: be, day after day, to look after the tea and eatables of the relatives
LINE 61: of our family; and these too will have no business to concern themselves
LINE 62: with outside matters. These forty will again be divided into two
LINE 63: companies, who will have nothing else to look to than to remain in front
LINE 64: of the coffin and offer incense, renew the oil, hang up the streamers,
LINE 65: watch the coffin, offer sacrifices of rice, and oblations of tea, and
LINE 66: mourn with the mourners; and neither need they mind anything outside
LINE 67: these duties. These four servants will be specially attached to the
LINE 68: inner tea-rooms to look after cups, saucers and the tea articles
LINE 69: generally; and in the event of the loss of any single thing, the four of
LINE 70: them will have to make it good between them. These other four servants
LINE 71: will have the sole charge of the articles required for eatables and
LINE 72: wine; and should any get mislaid compensation will have likewise to be
LINE 73: made by them. These eight servants will only have to attend to taking
LINE 74: over the sacrificial offerings; while these eight will have nothing more
LINE 75: to see to beyond keeping an eye over the lamps, oil, candles and paper
LINE 76: wanted everywhere. I'll have a whole supply served out and handed to you
LINE 77: eight to by and by apportion to the various places, in quantities which
LINE 78: I will determine. These thirty servants are each day, by rotation, to
LINE 79: keep watch everywhere during the night, looking after the gates and
LINE 80: windows, taking care of the fires and candles, and sweeping the grounds;
LINE 81: while the servants, who remain, are to be divided for duty in the houses
LINE 82: and rooms, each one having charge of a particular spot. And beginning
LINE 83: from the tables, chairs and curios in each place, up to the very
LINE 84: cuspidors and brooms, yea even to each blade of grass or sprout of herb,
LINE 85: which may be there, the servants looking after this part will be called
LINE 86: upon to make good anything that may be either mislaid or damaged. You,
LINE 87: Lai Sheng's wife, will every day have to exercise general supervision
LINE 88: and inspection; and should there be those who be lazy, any who may
LINE 89: gamble, drink, fight or wrangle, come at once and report the matter to
LINE 90: me; and you mustn't show any leniency, for if I come to find it out, I
LINE 91: shall have no regard to the good old name of three or four generations,
LINE 92: which you may enjoy. You now all have your fixed duties, so that
LINE 93: whatever batch of you after this acts contrary to these orders, I shall
LINE 94: simply have something to say to that batch and to no one else. The
LINE 95: servants, who have all along been in my service, carry watches on their
LINE 96: persons, and things, whether large or small, are invariably done at a
LINE 97: fixed time. But, in any case, you also have clocks in your master's
LINE 98: rooms, so that at 6.30, I shall come and read the roll, and at ten
LINE 99: you'll have breakfast. Whenever there is any indent of any permits to be
LINE 100: made or any report to be submitted, it should be done at 11.30 a.m. and
LINE 101: no later. At 7 p.m., after the evening paper has been burnt, I shall
LINE 102: come to each place in person to hold an inspection; and on my return,
LINE 103: the servants on watch for the night will hand over the keys. The next
LINE 104: day, I shall again come over at 6.30 in the morning; and needless to say
LINE 105: we must all do the best we can for these few days; and when the work has
LINE 106: been finished your master is sure to recompense you."
LINE 107: When she had done speaking, she went on to give orders that tea, oil,
LINE 108: candles, feather dusters, brooms and other necessaries should be issued,
LINE 109: according to the fixed quantities. She also had furniture, such as
LINE 110: table-covers, antimacassars, cushions, rugs, cuspidors, stools and the
LINE 111: like brought over and distributed; while, at the same time, she took up
LINE 112: the pencil and made a note of the names of the persons in charge of the
LINE 113: various departments, and of the articles taken over by the respective
LINE 114: servants, in entries remarkable for the utmost perspicacity.
LINE 115: The whole body of servants received their charge and left; but they all
LINE 116: had work to go and attend to; not as in former times, when they were at
LINE 117: liberty to select for themselves what was convenient to do, while the
LINE 118: arduous work, which remained over, no one could be found to take in
LINE 119: hand. Neither was it possible for them in the various establishments to
LINE 120: any longer avail themselves of the confusion to carelessly mislay
LINE 121: things. In fact, visitors came and guests left, but everything after all
LINE 122: went off quietly, unlike the disorderly way which prevailed hitherto,
LINE 123: when there was no clue to the ravel; and all such abuses as indolence,
LINE 124: and losses, and the like were completely eradicated.
LINE 125: Lady Feng, on her part, (perceiving) the weight her influence had in
LINE 126: enjoining the observance of her directions, was in her heart exceedingly
LINE 127: delighted. But as she saw, that Chia Chen was, in consequence of Mrs.
LINE 128: Yu's indisposition, even so much the more grieved as to take very little
LINE 129: to drink or to eat, she daily, with her own hands, prepared, in the
LINE 130: other mansion, every kind of fine congee and luscious small dishes,
LINE 131: which she sent over, in order that he might be tempted to eat.
LINE 132: And Chia Lien had likewise given additional directions that every day
LINE 133: the finest delicacies should be taken into the ante-chamber, for the
LINE 134: exclusive use of lady Feng.
LINE 135: Lady Feng was not one to shirk exertion and fatigue, so that, day after
LINE 136: day, she came over at the proper time, called the roll, and managed
LINE 137: business, sitting all alone in the ante-chamber, and not congregating
LINE 138: with the whole bevy of sisters-in-law. Indeed, even when relatives or
LINE 139: visitors came or went, she did not go to receive them, or see them off.
LINE 140: This day was the thirty-fifth day, the very day of the fifth seven, and
LINE 141: the whole company of bonzes had just (commenced the services) for
LINE 142: unclosing the earth, and breaking Hell open; for sending a light to show
LINE 143: the way to the departed spirit; for its being admitted to an audience by
LINE 144: the king of Hell; for arresting all the malicious devils, as well as for
LINE 145: soliciting the soul-saving Buddha to open the golden bridge and to lead
LINE 146: the way with streamers. The Taoist priests were engaged in reverently
LINE 147: reading the prayers; in worshipping the Three Pure Ones and in
LINE 148: prostrating themselves before the Gemmy Lord. The disciples of
LINE 149: abstraction were burning incense, in order to release the hungered
LINE 150: spirits, and were reading the water regrets manual. There was also a
LINE 151: company of twelve nuns of tender years, got up in embroidered dresses,
LINE 152: and wearing red shoes, who stood before the coffin, silently reading all
LINE 153: the incantations for the reception of the spirit (from the lower
LINE 154: regions,) with the result that the utmost bustle and stir prevailed.
LINE 155: Lady Feng, well aware that not a few guests would call on this day, was
LINE 156: quick to get out of bed at four sharp, to dress her hair and perform her
LINE 157: ablutions. After having completed every arrangement for the day, she
LINE 158: changed her costume, washed her hands, and swallowed a couple of
LINE 159: mouthfuls of milk. By the time she had rinsed her mouth, it was exactly
LINE 160: 6.30; and Lai Wang's wife, at the head of a company of servants, had
LINE 161: been waiting a good long while, when lady Feng appeared in front of the
LINE 162: Entrance Hall, mounted her carriage and betook herself, preceded by a
LINE 163: pair of transparent horn lanterns, on which were written, in large type,
LINE 164: the three characters, Jung Kuo mansion, to the main entrance gate of the
LINE 165: Ning Household. The door lanterns shed brilliant rays from where they
LINE 166: were suspended; while on either side the lanterns, of uniform colours,
LINE 167: propped upright, emitted a lustrous light as bright as day.
LINE 168: The servants of the family, got up in their mourning clothes, covered
LINE 169: the ground far and wide like a white sheet. They stood drawn in two
LINE 170: rows, and requested that the carriage should drive up to the main
LINE 171: entrance. The youths retired, and all the married women came forward,
LINE 172: and raising the curtain of the carriage, lady Feng alighted; and as with
LINE 173: one arm she supported herself on Feng Erh, two married women, with
LINE 174: lanterns in their hands, lighted the way. Pressed round by the servants,
LINE 175: lady Feng made her entry. The married women of the Ning mansion advanced
LINE 176: to greet her, and to pay their respects; and this over, lady Feng, with
LINE 177: graceful bearing, entered the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.
LINE 178: Ascending the Spirit Hall, where the tablet was laid, the tears, as soon
LINE 179: as she caught sight of the coffin, trickled down her eyes like pearls
LINE 180: whose string had snapped; while the youths in the court, and their
LINE 181: number was not small, stood in a reverent posture, with their arms
LINE 182: against their sides, waiting to burn the paper. Lady Feng uttered one
LINE 183: remark, by way of command: "Offer the tea and burn the paper!" when the
LINE 184: sound of two blows on the gong was heard and the whole band struck up
LINE 185: together. A servant had at an early period placed a large armchair in
LINE 186: front of the tablet, and lady Feng sat down, and gave way to loud
LINE 187: lamentations. Promptly all those, who stood inside or outside, whether
LINE 188: high or low, male or female, took up the note, and kept on wailing and
LINE 189: weeping until Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu, after a time, sent a message to
LINE 190: advise her to withhold her tears; when at length lady Feng desisted.
LINE 191: Lai Wang's wife served the tea; and when she had finished rinsing her
LINE 192: mouth, lady Feng got up; and, taking leave of all the members of the
LINE 193: clan, she walked all alone into the ante-chamber, where she ascertained,
LINE 194: in the order of their names, the number of the servants of every
LINE 195: denomination in there. They were all found to be present, with the
LINE 196: exception of one, who had failed to appear, whose duties consisted in
LINE 197: receiving and escorting the relatives and visitors. Orders were promptly
LINE 198: given to summon him, and the man appeared in a dreadful fright. "What!"
LINE 199: exclaimed lady Feng, as she forced a smile, "is it you who have been
LINE 200: remiss? Is it because you're more respectable than they that you don't
LINE 201: choose to listen to my words?"
LINE 202: "Your servant," he pleaded, "has come at an early hour every day; and
LINE 203: it's only to-day that I come late by one step; and I entreat your
LINE 204: ladyship to forgive this my first offence."
LINE 205: While yet he spoke, she perceived the wife of Wang Hsing, of the Jung
LINE 206: Kuo mansion, come forward and pop her head in to see what was going on;
LINE 207: but lady Feng did not let this man go, but went on to inquire of Wang
LINE 208: Hsing's wife what she had come for.
LINE 209: Wang Hsing's wife drew near. "I've come," she explained, "to get an
LINE 210: order, so as to obtain some thread to make tassels for the carriages and
LINE 211: chairs." Saying this, she produced the permit and handed it up,
LINE 212: whereupon lady Feng directed Ts'ai Ming to read the contents aloud. "For
LINE 213: two large, sedan chairs," he said, "four small sedan chairs and four
LINE 214: carriages, are needed in all so many large and small tassels, each
LINE 215: tassel requiring so many catties of beads and thread."
LINE 216: Lady Feng finding, after she had heard what was read, that the numbers
LINE 217: (and quantities) corresponded, forthwith bade Ts'ai Ming make the proper
LINE 218: entry; and when the order from the Jung Kuo mansion had been fetched,
LINE 219: and thrown at her, Wang Hsing's wife took her departure.
LINE 220: Lady Feng was on the very point of saying something, when she espied
LINE 221: four managers of the Jung Kuo mansion walk in; all of whom wanted
LINE 222: permits to indent for stores. Having asked them to read out the list of
LINE 223: what they required, she ascertained that they wanted four kinds of
LINE 224: articles in all. Drawing attention to two items: "These entries," she
LINE 225: remarked, "are wrong; and you had better go again and make out the
LINE 226: account clearly, and then come and fetch a permit."
LINE 227: With these words, she flung down the requisitions, and the two men went
LINE 228: their way in lower spirits than when they had come.
LINE 229: Lady Feng then caught sight of the wife of Chang Ts'ai standing by, and
LINE 230: asked her what was her business, whereupon Chang Ts'ai's wife promptly
LINE 231: produced an indent. "The covers of the carriages and sedan chairs," she
LINE 232: reported, "have just been completed, and I've come to fetch the amount
LINE 233: due to the tailors for wages."
LINE 234: Lady Feng, upon hearing her explanation, took over the indent, and
LINE 235: directed Ts'ai Ming to enter the items in the book. After Wang Hsing had
LINE 236: handed over the money, and obtained the receipt of the accountant, duly
LINE 237: signed, which tallied with the payment, he subsequently walked away in
LINE 238: company with Chang Ts'ai's wife. Lady Feng simultaneously proceeded to
LINE 239: give orders that another indent should be read, which was for money to
LINE 240: purchase paper with to paste on the windows of Pao-y√º's outer
LINE 241: school-room, the repairs to which had been brought to completion, and as
LINE 242: soon as lady Feng heard the nature of the application, she there and
LINE 243: then gave directions that the permit should be taken over and an entry
LINE 244: made, and that the money should be issued after Chang Ts'ai's wife had
LINE 245: delivered everything clearly.
LINE 246: "If to-morrow he were to come late," lady Feng then remarked, "and if
LINE 247: the day after, I were to come late; why by and by there'll be no one
LINE 248: here at all! I should have liked to have let you off, but if I be
LINE 249: lenient with you on this first instance, it will be hard for me, on the
LINE 250: occurrence of another offence, to exercise any control over the rest.
LINE 251: It's much better therefore that I should settle accounts with you."
LINE 252: The moment she uttered these words, she put on a serious look, and gave
LINE 253: orders that he should be taken out and administered twenty blows with
LINE 254: the bamboo. When the servants perceived that lady Feng was in an angry
LINE 255: mood, they did not venture to dilly-dally, but dragged him out, and gave
LINE 256: him the full number of blows; which done, they came in to report that
LINE 257: the punishment had been inflicted.
LINE 258: Lady Feng likewise threw down the Ning Mansion order and exclaimed,
LINE 259: addressing herself to Lai Sheng: "Cut him a month's wages and rice! and
LINE 260: tell them all to disperse, and have done with it!"
LINE 261: All the servants at length withdrew to attend to their respective
LINE 262: duties, while the man too, who had been flogged, walked away, as he did
LINE 263: all he could to conceal his shame and stifle his tears. About this time
LINE 264: arrived and went, in an incessant stream, servants from both the Jung
LINE 265: and Ning mansions, bent upon applying for permits and returning permits,
LINE 266: and with one by one again did lady Feng settle accounts. And, as in due
LINE 267: course, the inmates of the Ning mansion came to know how terrible lady
LINE 268: Feng was, each and all were ever since so wary and dutiful that they did
LINE 269: not venture to be lazy.
LINE 270: But without going into further details on this subject, we shall now
LINE 271: return to Pao-y√º. Seeing that there were a lot of people about and
LINE 272: fearing lest Ch'in Chung might receive some offence, he lost no time in
LINE 273: coming along with him to sit over at lady Feng's. Lady Feng was just
LINE 274: having her repast, and upon seeing them arrive: "Your legs are long
LINE 275: enough, and couldn't you have come somewhat quicker!" she laughingly
LINE 276: observed.
LINE 277: "We've had our rice, thanks," replied Pao-y√º.
LINE 278: "Have you had it," inquired lady Feng, "outside here, or over on the
LINE 279: other side?"
LINE 280: "Would we eat anything with all that riff-raff?" exclaimed Pao-y√º;
LINE 281: "we've really had it over there; in fact, I now come after having had
LINE 282: mine with dowager lady Chia."
LINE 283: As he uttered these words, they took their seats. Lady Feng had just
LINE 284: finished her meal, when a married woman from the Ning mansion came to
LINE 285: get an order to obtain an advance of money to purchase incense and
LINE 286: lanterns with.
LINE 287: "I calculated," observed lady Feng, "that you would come to-day to make
LINE 288: requisition, but I was under the impression that you had forgotten; had
LINE 289: you really done so you would certainly have had to get them on your own
LINE 290: account, and I would have been the one to benefit."
LINE 291: "Didn't I forget? I did," rejoined the married woman as she smiled; "and
LINE 292: it's only a few minutes back that it came to my mind; had I been one
LINE 293: second later I wouldn't have been in time to get the things."
LINE 294: These words ended, she took over the order and went off. Entries had, at
LINE 295: the time to be made in the books, and orders to be issued, and Ch'in
LINE 296: Chung was induced to interpose with a smirk, "In both these mansions of
LINE 297: yours, such orders are alike in use; but were any outsider stealthily to
LINE 298: counterfeit one and to abscond, after getting the money, what could ever
LINE 299: be done?"
LINE 300: "In what you say," replied lady Feng, "you take no account of the laws
LINE 301: of the land."
LINE 302: "How is it that from our house, no one comes to get any orders or to
LINE 303: obtain anything?" Pao-y√º having inquired: "At the time they come to
LINE 304: fetch them," rejoined lady Feng, "you're still dreaming; but let me ask
LINE 305: you one thing, when will you two at last begin your evening course of
LINE 306: studies?"
LINE 307: "Oh, I wish we were able to begin our studies this very day," Pao-y√º
LINE 308: added; "that would be the best thing, but they're very slow in putting
LINE 309: the school-room in order, so that there's no help for it!"
LINE 310: Lady Feng laughed. "Had you asked me," she remarked, "I can assure you
LINE 311: it would have been ready quick enough."
LINE 312: "You too would have been of no use," observed Pao-y√º, "for it will
LINE 313: certainly be ready by the time they ought to finish it in."
LINE 314: "But in order that they should do the work," suggested lady Feng, "it's
LINE 315: also necessary that they should have the material, they can't do without
LINE 316: them; and if I don't give them any permits, it will be difficult to
LINE 317: obtain them."
LINE 318: Pao-y√º at these words readily drew near to lady Feng, and there and then
LINE 319: applied for the permits. "My dear sister," he added, "do give them the
LINE 320: permits to enable them to obtain the material and effect the repairs."
LINE 321: "I feel quite sore from fatigue," ventured lady Feng, "and how can I
LINE 322: stand your rubbing against me? but compose your mind. They have this
LINE 323: very day got the paper, and gone to paste it; and would they, for
LINE 324: whatever they need, have still waited until they had been sent for? they
LINE 325: are not such fools after all!"
LINE 326: Pao-y√º would not believe it, and lady Feng at once called Ts'ai Ming to
LINE 327: look up the list, which she handed for Pao-y√º's inspection; but while
LINE 328: they were arguing a servant came in to announce that Chao Erh, who had
LINE 329: gone to Su Chow, had returned, and lady Feng all in a flurry directed
LINE 330: that he should be asked to walk in. Chao Erh bent one knee and paid his
LINE 331: obeisance.
LINE 332: "Why have you come back?" lady Feng readily inquired.
LINE 333: "Mr. Secundus (Chia Lien)," he reported, "sent me back to tell you that
LINE 334: Mr. Lin (our dowager lady's) son-in-law, died on the third of the ninth
LINE 335: moon; that Master Secundus is taking Miss Lin along with him to escort
LINE 336: the coffin of Mr. Lin as far as Su Chow; and that they hope to be back
LINE 337: some time about the end of the year. Master despatched me to come and
LINE 338: announce the news, to bring his compliments, and to crave our old lady's
LINE 339: instructions as well as to see how you are getting on in my lady's home.
LINE 340: He also bade me take back to him a few long fur pelisses."
LINE 341: "Have you seen any one else besides me?" lady Feng inquired.
LINE 342: "I've seen every one," rejoined Chao Erh; and withdrew hastily at the
LINE 343: conclusion of this remark, out of the apartment, while lady Feng turned
LINE 344: towards Pao-y√º with a smile and said, "Your cousin Lin can now live in
LINE 345: our house for ever."
LINE 346: "Poor thing!" exclaimed Pao-y√º. "I presume that during all these days
LINE 347: she has wept who knows how much;" and saying this he wrinkled his brow
LINE 348: and heaved a deep sigh.
LINE 349: Lady Feng saw Chao Erh on his return, but as she could not very well, in
LINE 350: the presence of third persons, make minute inquiries after Chia Lien,
LINE 351: she had to continue a prey to inward solicitude till it was time to go
LINE 352: home, for, not having got through what she had to do, she was compelled
LINE 353: to wait patiently until she went back in the evening, when she again
LINE 354: sent word for Chao Erh to come in, and asked him with all minuteness
LINE 355: whether the journey had been pleasant throughout, and for full
LINE 356: particulars. That very night, she got in readiness the long pelisses,
LINE 357: which she herself, with the assistance of P'ing Erh, packed up in a
LINE 358: bundle; and after careful thought as to what things he would require,
LINE 359: she put them in the same bundle and committed them to Chao Erh's care.
LINE 360: She went on to solicitously impress upon Chao Erh to be careful in his
LINE 361: attendance abroad. "Don't provoke your master to wrath," she said, "and
LINE 362: from time to time do advise him not to drink too much wine; and don't
LINE 363: entice him to make the acquaintance of any low people; for if you do,
LINE 364: when you come back I will cut your leg off."
LINE 365: The preparations were hurriedly and confusedly completed; and it was
LINE 366: already the fourth watch of the night when she went to sleep. But soon
LINE 367: again the day dawned, and after hastily performing her toilette and
LINE 368: ablutions, she came over to the Ning Mansion.
LINE 369: As Chia Chen realised that the day for escorting the body away was
LINE 370: drawing nigh, he in person went out in a curricle, along with
LINE 371: geomancers, to the Temple of the Iron Fence to inspect a suitable place
LINE 372: for depositing the coffin. He also, point by point, enjoined the
LINE 373: resident managing-bonze, Se K'ung, to mind and get ready brand-new
LINE 374: articles of decoration and furniture, and to invite a considerable
LINE 375: number of bonzes of note to be at hand to lend their services for the
LINE 376: reception of the coffin.
LINE 377: Se K'ung lost no time in getting ready the evening meal, but Chia Chen
LINE 378: had, in fact, no wish for any tea or rice; and, as the day was far
LINE 379: advanced and he was not in time to enter the city, he had, after all, to
LINE 380: rest during that night as best he could in a "chaste" room in the
LINE 381: temple. The next morning, as soon as it was day, he hastened to come
LINE 382: into the city and to make every preparation for the funeral. He likewise
LINE 383: deputed messengers to proceed ahead to the Temple of the Iron Fence to
LINE 384: give, that very night, additional decorative touches to the place where
LINE 385: the coffin was to be deposited, and to get ready tea and all the other
LINE 386: necessaries, for the use of the persons who would be present at the
LINE 387: reception of the coffin.
LINE 388: Lady Feng, seeing that the day was not far distant, also apportioned
LINE 389: duties and made provision for everything beforehand with circumspect
LINE 390: care; while at the same time she chose in the Jung mansion, such
LINE 391: carriages, sedan chairs and retinue as were to accompany the cortege, in
LINE 392: attendance upon madame Wang, and gave her mind furthermore to finding a
LINE 393: place where she herself could put up in at the time of the funeral.
LINE 394: About this very time, it happened that the consort of the Duke Shan Kuo
LINE 395: departed this life, and that mesdames Wang and Hsing had likewise to go
LINE 396: and offer sacrifices, and to follow the burial procession; that the
LINE 397: birthday occurred of the consort of Prince Hsi An; that presents had to
LINE 398: be forwarded on the occasion of this anniversary; and that the consort
LINE 399: of the Duke of Chen Kuo gave birth to a first child, a son, and
LINE 400: congratulatory gifts had, in like manner, to be provided. Besides, her
LINE 401: uterine brother Wang Jen was about to return south, with all his family,
LINE 402: and she had too to write her home letters, to send her reverent
LINE 403: compliments to her father and mother, as well as to get the things ready
LINE 404: that were to be taken along. There was also Ying Ch'un, who had
LINE 405: contracted some illness, and the doctor had every day to be sent for,
LINE 406: and medicines to be administered, the notes of the doctor to be looked
LINE 407: after, consisting of the bulletins of the diagnosis and the
LINE 408: prescriptions, with the result that the various things that had to be
LINE 409: attended to by lady Feng were so manifold that it would, indeed, be
LINE 410: difficult to give an exhaustive idea of them.
LINE 411: In addition to all this, the day for taking the coffin away was close at
LINE 412: hand, so that lady Feng was so hard pressed for time that she had even
LINE 413: no desire for any tea to drink or anything to eat, and that she could
LINE 414: not sit or rest in peace. As soon as she put her foot into the Ning
LINE 415: mansion, the inmates of the Jung mansion would follow close upon her
LINE 416: heels; and the moment she got back into the Jung mansion, the servants
LINE 417: again of the Ning mansion would follow her about. In spite however of
LINE 418: this great pressure, lady Feng, whose natural disposition had ever been
LINE 419: to try and excel, was urged to strain the least of her energies, as her
LINE 420: sole dread was lest she should incur unfavourable criticism from any
LINE 421: one; and so excellent were the plans she devised, that every one in the
LINE 422: clan, whether high or low, readily conceded her unlimited praise.
LINE 423: On the night of this day, the body had to be watched, and in the inner
LINE 424: suite of apartments two companies of young players as well as jugglers
LINE 425: entertained the relatives, friends and other visitors during the whole
LINE 426: of the night. Mrs. Yu was still laid up in the inside room, so that the
LINE 427: whole task of attending to and entertaining the company devolved upon
LINE 428: lady Feng alone, who had to look after everything; for though there
LINE 429: were, in the whole clan, many sisters-in-law, some there were too
LINE 430: bashful to speak, others too timid to stand on their feet; while there
LINE 431: were also those who were not accustomed to meeting company; and those
LINE 432: likewise who were afraid of people of high estate and shy of officials.
LINE 433: Of every kind there were, but the whole number of them could not come up
LINE 434: to lady Feng's standard, whose deportment was correct and whose speech
LINE 435: was according to rule. Hence it was that she did not even so much as
LINE 436: heed any of that large company, but gave directions and issued orders,
LINE 437: adopting any course of action which she fancied, just as if there were
LINE 438: no bystander.
LINE 439: The whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the fires
LINE 440: brilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out and
LINE 441: officials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle and
LINE 442: stir nothing need, of course, be said.
LINE 443: The next morning at the dawn of day, and at a propitious moment,
LINE 444: sixty-four persons, dressed all alike in blue, carried the coffin,
LINE 445: preceded by a streamer with the record in large characters: Coffin of
LINE 446: lady Ch'in, a lady of the fifth degree, (by marriage) of the Chia
LINE 447: mansion, deceased at middle age, consort of the grandson of the Ning Kuo
LINE 448: Duke with the first rank title of honour, (whose status is) a guard of
LINE 449: the Imperial antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner
LINE 450: Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City.
LINE 451: The various paraphernalia and ornaments were all brand-new, hurriedly
LINE 452: made for the present occasion, and the uniform lustrous brilliancy they
LINE 453: shed was sufficient to dazzle the eyes.
LINE 454: Pao-chu, of course, observed the rites prescribed for unmarried
LINE 455: daughters, and dashed the bowl and walked by the coffin, as she gave way
LINE 456: to most bitter lamentations.
LINE 457: At that time, among the officials who escorted the funeral procession,
LINE 458: were Niu Chi-tsung, the grandson of the Chen Kuo duke, who had now
LINE 459: inherited the status of earl of the first degree; Liu Fang, the grandson
LINE 460: of Liu Piao, duke of Li Kuo, who had recently inherited the rank of
LINE 461: viscount of the first class; Ch'en Jui-wen, a grandson of Ch'en Yi, duke
LINE 462: of Ch'i Kuo, who held the hereditary rank of general of the third
LINE 463: degree, with the prefix of majestic authority; Ma Shang, the grandson of
LINE 464: Ma K'uei, duke of Chih Kuo, by inheritance general of the third rank
LINE 465: with the prefix of majesty afar; Hou Hsiao-keng, an hereditary viscount
LINE 466: of the first degree, grandson of the duke of Hsiu Kuo, Hou Hsiao-ming by
LINE 467: name; while the death of the consort of the duke of Shan Kuo had obliged
LINE 468: his grandson Shih Kuang-chu to go into mourning so that he could not be
LINE 469: present. These were the six families which had, along with the two
LINE 470: households of Jung and Ning, been, at one time, designated the eight
LINE 471: dukes.
LINE 472: Among the rest, there were besides the grandson of the Prince of Nan An;
LINE 473: the grandson of the Prince of Hsi An; Shih Ting, marquis of Chung Ching;
LINE 474: Chiang Tzu-ning, an hereditary baron of the second grade, grandson of
LINE 475: the earl of P'ing Yuan; Hsieh K'un, an hereditary baron of the second
LINE 476: order and Captain of the Metropolitan camp, grandson of the marquis of
LINE 477: Ting Ch'ang: Hsi Chien-hui, an hereditary baron of the second rank, a
LINE 478: grandson of the marquis of Nang Yang; Ch'in Liang, in command of the
LINE 479: Five Cities, grandson of the marquis of Ching T'ien. The remainder were
LINE 480: Wei Chi, the son of the earl of Chin Hsiang; Feng Tzu-ying, the son of a
LINE 481: general, whose prefix was supernatural martial spirit; Ch'en Yeh-ch√ºn,
LINE 482: Wei Jo-lan and others, grandsons and sons of princes who could not be
LINE 483: enumerated.
LINE 484: In the way of ladies, there were also in all about ten large official
LINE 485: sedan chairs full of them, thirty or forty private chairs, and including
LINE 486: the official and non-official chairs, and carriages containing inmates
LINE 487: of the household, there must have been over a hundred and ten; so that
LINE 488: with the various kinds of paraphernalia, articles of decoration and
LINE 489: hundreds of nick-nacks, which preceded, the vast expanse of the cortege
LINE 490: covered a continuous line extending over three or four li.
LINE 491: They had not been very long on their way, when they reached variegated
LINE 492: sheds soaring high by the roadside, in which banquets were spread,
LINE 493: feasts laid out, and music discoursed in unison. These were the viatory
LINE 494: sacrificial offerings contributed by the respective families. The first
LINE 495: shed contained the sacrificial donations of the mansion of the Prince of
LINE 496: Tung P'ing; the second shed those of the Prince of Nan An; the third
LINE 497: those of the Prince of Hsi Ning, and the fourth those of the Prince of
LINE 498: Pei Ching.
LINE 499: Indeed of these four Princes, the reputation enjoyed in former days by
LINE 500: the Prince of Pei Ching had been the most exalted, and to this day his
LINE 501: sons and grandsons still succeeded to the inheritance of the princely
LINE 502: dignity. The present incumbent of the Princedom of Pei Ching, Shih Jung,
LINE 503: had not as yet come of age, but he was gifted with a presence of
LINE 504: exceptional beauty, and with a disposition condescending and genial. At
LINE 505: the demise, recently, of the consort of the eldest grandson of the
LINE 506: mansion of Ning Kuo, he, in consideration of the friendship which had
LINE 507: formerly existed between the two grandfathers, by virtue of which they
LINE 508: had been inseparable, both in adversity as well as in prosperity,
LINE 509: treating each other as if they had not been of different surnames, was
LINE 510: consequently induced to pay no regard to princely dignity or to his
LINE 511: importance, but having like the others paid, on the previous day, his
LINE 512: condolences and presented sacrificial offerings, he had further now
LINE 513: raised a shed wherein to offer libations. Having directed every one of
LINE 514: his subordinate officers to remain in this spot in attendance, he
LINE 515: himself went at the fifth watch to court, and when he acquitted himself
LINE 516: of his public duties he forthwith changed his attire for a mourning
LINE 517: costume, and came along, in an official sedan chair, preceded by gongs
LINE 518: and umbrellas. Upon reaching the front of the shed the chair was
LINE 519: deposited on the ground, and as his subordinate officers pressed on
LINE 520: either side and waited upon him, neither the military nor the populace,
LINE 521: which composed the mass of people, ventured to make any commotion. In a
LINE 522: short while, the long procession of the Ning mansion became visible,
LINE 523: spreading far and wide, covering in its course from the north, the whole
LINE 524: ground like a silver mountain. At an early hour, the forerunners,
LINE 525: messengers and other attendants on the staff of the Ning mansion
LINE 526: apprised Chia Chen (of the presence of the sheds), and Chia Chen with
LINE 527: all alacrity gave orders that the foremost part of the cortege should
LINE 528: halt. Attended by Chia She and Chia Chen, the three of them came with
LINE 529: hurried step to greet (the Prince of Pei Ching), whom they saluted with
LINE 530: due ceremony. Shih Jung, who was seated in his sedan chair, made a bow
LINE 531: and returned their salutations with a smile, proceeding to address them
LINE 532: and to treat them, as he had done hitherto, as old friends, without any
LINE 533: airs of self-importance.
LINE 534: "My daughter's funeral has," observed Chia Chen, "put your Highness to
LINE 535: the trouble of coming, an honour which we, though noble by birth, do not
LINE 536: deserve."
LINE 537: Shih Jung smiled. "With the terms of friendship," he added, "which have
LINE 538: existed for so many generations (between our families), is there any
LINE 539: need for such apologies?"
LINE 540: Turning his head round there and then, he gave directions to the senior
LINE 541: officer of his household to preside at the sacrifices and to offer
LINE 542: libations in his stead; and Chia She and the others stood together on
LINE 543: one side and made obeisance in return, and then came in person again and
LINE 544: gave expression to their gratitude for his bounty.
LINE 545: Shih Jung was most affable and complaisant. "Which is the gentleman," he
LINE 546: inquired of Chia Chen, "who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth?
LINE 547: I've long had a wish to have the pleasure of seeing him, and as he's
LINE 548: sure to be on the spot on an occasion like this, why shouldn't you
LINE 549: invite him to come round?"
LINE 550: Chia Chen speedily drew back, and bidding Pao-y√º change his mourning
LINE 551: clothes, he led him forward and presented him.
LINE 552: Pao-y√º had all along heard that Shih Jung was a worthy Prince, perfect
LINE 553: in ability as well as in appearance, pleasant and courteous, not bound
LINE 554: down by any official custom or state rite, so that he had repeatedly
LINE 555: felt a keen desire to meet him. With the sharp control, however, which
LINE 556: his father exercised over him, he had not been able to gratify his wish.
LINE 557: But on this occasion, he saw on the contrary that he came to call him,
LINE 558: and it was but natural that he should be delighted. Whilst advancing, he
LINE 559: scrutinised Shih Jung with the corner of his eye, who, seated as he was
LINE 560: in the sedan chair, presented an imposing sight.
LINE 561: But, reader, what occurred on his approach is not yet known, but listen
LINE 562: to the next chapter, which will divulge it.
