LINE 1: Pao-yü and Tai-yü make use of some beautiful passages from the Record
LINE 2: of the Western Side-building to bandy jokes.
LINE 3: The excellent ballads sung in the Peony Pavilion touch the tender
LINE 4: heart of Tai-yü.
LINE 5: Soon after the day on which Chia Yuan-ch'un honoured the garden of Broad
LINE 6: Vista with a visit, and her return to the Palace, so our story goes, she
LINE 7: forthwith desired that T'an-ch'un should make a careful copy, in
LINE 8: consecutive order, of the verses, which had been composed and read out
LINE 9: on that occasion, in order that she herself should assign them their
LINE 10: rank, and adjudge the good and bad. And she also directed that an
LINE 11: inscription should be engraved on a stone, in the Broad Vista park, to
LINE 12: serve in future years as a record of the pleasant and felicitous event;
LINE 13: and Chia Cheng, therefore, gave orders to servants to go far and wide,
LINE 14: and select skilful artificers and renowned workmen, to polish the stone
LINE 15: and engrave the characters in the garden of Broad Vista; while Chia Chen
LINE 16: put himself at the head of Chia Jung, Chia P'ing and others to
LINE 17: superintend the work. And as Chia Se had, on the other hand, the control
LINE 18: of Wen Kuan and the rest of the singing girls, twelve in all, as well as
LINE 19: of their costumes and other properties, he had no leisure to attend to
LINE 20: anything else, and consequently once again sent for Chia Ch'ang and Chia
LINE 21: Ling to come and act as overseers.
LINE 22: On a certain day, the works were taken in hand for rubbing the stones
LINE 23: smooth with wax, for carving the inscription, and tracing it with
LINE 24: vermilion, but without entering into details on these matters too
LINE 25: minutely, we will return to the two places, the Yu Huang temple and the
LINE 26: Ta Mo monastery. The company of twelve young bonzes and twelve young
LINE 27: Taoist priests had now moved out of the Garden of Broad Vista, and Chia
LINE 28: Cheng was meditating upon distributing them to various temples to live
LINE 29: apart, when unexpectedly Chia Ch'in's mother, née Chou,--who resided in
LINE 30: the back street, and had been at the time contemplating to pay a visit
LINE 31: to Chia Cheng on this side so as to obtain some charge, be it either
LINE 32: large or small, for her son to look after, that he too should be put in
LINE 33: the way of turning up some money to meet his expenses with,--came, as
LINE 34: luck would have it, to hear that some work was in hand in this mansion,
LINE 35: and lost no time in driving over in a curricle and making her appeal to
LINE 36: lady Feng. And as lady Feng remembered that she had all along not
LINE 37: presumed on her position to put on airs, she willingly acceded to her
LINE 38: request, and after calling to memory some suitable remarks, she at once
LINE 39: went to make her report to madame Wang: "These young bonzes and Taoist
LINE 40: priests," she said, "can by no means be sent over to other places; for
LINE 41: were the Imperial consort to come out at an unexpected moment, they
LINE 42: would then be required to perform services; and in the event of their
LINE 43: being scattered, there will, when the time comes to requisition their
LINE 44: help, again be difficulties in the way; and my idea is that it would be
LINE 45: better to send them all to the family temple, the Iron Fence Temple; and
LINE 46: every month all there will be to do will be to depute some one to take
LINE 47: over a few taels for them to buy firewood and rice with, that's all, and
LINE 48: when there's even a sound of their being required uttered, some one can
LINE 49: at once go and tell them just one word 'come,' and they will come
LINE 50: without the least trouble!"
LINE 51: Madame Wang gave a patient ear to this proposal, and, in due course,
LINE 52: consulted with Chia Cheng.
LINE 53: "You've really," smiled Chia Cheng at these words, "reminded me how I
LINE 54: should act! Yes, let this be done!" And there and then he sent for Chia
LINE 55: Lien.
LINE 56: Chia Lien was, at the time, having his meal with lady Feng, but as soon
LINE 57: as he heard that he was wanted, he put by his rice and was just walking
LINE 58: off, when lady Feng clutched him and pulled him back. "Wait a while,"
LINE 59: she observed with a smirk, "and listen to what I've got to tell you! if
LINE 60: it's about anything else, I've nothing to do with it; but if it be about
LINE 61: the young bonzes and young Taoists, you must, in this particular matter,
LINE 62: please comply with this suggestion of mine," after which, she went on in
LINE 63: this way and that way to put him up to a whole lot of hints.
LINE 64: "I know nothing about it," Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, "and as you
LINE 65: have the knack you yourself had better go and tell him!"
LINE 66: But as soon as lady Feng heard this remark, she stiffened her head and
LINE 67: threw down the chopsticks; and, with an expression on her cheeks, which
LINE 68: looked like a smile and yet not a smile, she glanced angrily at Chia
LINE 69: Lien. "Are you speaking in earnest," she inquired, "or are you only
LINE 70: jesting?"
LINE 71: "Yün Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law of the western porch, has
LINE 72: come and appealed to me two or three times, asking for something to look
LINE 73: after," Chia Lien laughed, "and I assented and bade him wait; and now,
LINE 74: after a great deal of trouble, this job has turned up; and there you are
LINE 75: once again snatching it away!"
LINE 76: "Compose your mind," lady Feng observed grinning, "for the Imperial
LINE 77: Consort has hinted that directions should be given for the planting, in
LINE 78: the north-east corner of the park, of a further plentiful supply of pine
LINE 79: and cedar trees, and that orders should also be issued for the addition,
LINE 80: round the base of the tower, of a large number of flowers and plants and
LINE 81: such like; and when this job turns up, I can safely tell you that Yun
LINE 82: Erh will be called to assume control of these works."
LINE 83: "Well if that be really so," Chia Lien rejoined, "it will after all do!
LINE 84: But there's only one thing; all I was up to last night was simply to
LINE 85: have some fun with you, but you obstinately and perversely wouldn't."
LINE 86: Lady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound of
LINE 87: Ch'ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head and
LINE 88: went on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedily
LINE 89: walked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, where
LINE 90: he saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lien
LINE 91: readily carried out lady Feng's suggestion. "As from all appearances,"
LINE 92: he continued, "Ch'in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this job
LINE 93: should, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and provided
LINE 94: that in observance with the inside custom Ch'in Erh were each day told
LINE 95: to receive the advances, things will go on all right." And as Chia Cheng
LINE 96: had never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, as
LINE 97: soon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified his
LINE 98: approval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters,
LINE 99: communicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sent
LINE 100: some one to go and notify dame Chou.
LINE 101: Chia Ch'in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and his
LINE 102: wife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Feng
LINE 103: bestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment,
LINE 104: an advance of the funds necessary for three months' outlay, for which
LINE 105: she bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque and
LINE 106: signed it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he came
LINE 107: out into the treasury where the sum specified for three months'
LINE 108: supplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots.
LINE 109: Chia Ch'in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, and
LINE 110: gave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them to
LINE 111: have a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take the
LINE 112: money to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, he
LINE 113: hired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke several
LINE 114: carriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; where
LINE 115: having called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages,
LINE 116: and sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the Iron
LINE 117: Fence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time.
LINE 118: But we will now notice Chia Yüan-ch'un, within the precincts of the
LINE 119: Palace. When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of Broad
LINE 120: Vista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sights
LINE 121: in the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to be
LINE 122: diligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; and
LINE 123: that by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to this
LINE 124: garden? "Besides," (she pondered), "in that household, there are at
LINE 125: present several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able to
LINE 126: write poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to go
LINE 127: and take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome persons
LINE 128: might not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willows
LINE 129: may not lack any one to admire them!"
LINE 130: But remembering likewise that Pao-yü had from his infancy grown up among
LINE 131: that crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of his
LINE 132: male cousins that were he not allowed to move into it, he would, she
LINE 133: also apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest his
LINE 134: grandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart, she thought it
LINE 135: imperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quarters
LINE 136: inside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; and
LINE 137: directing the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliver
LINE 138: her commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch'ai and the other girls
LINE 139: should live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, and
LINE 140: urged that Pao-yü should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, for
LINE 141: the prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, upon
LINE 142: receiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, to
LINE 143: explain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into the
LINE 144: garden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out the
LINE 145: portieres and bed-curtains. The tidings were heard by the rest even with
LINE 146: perfect equanimity, but Pao-yü was immoderately delighted; and he was
LINE 147: engaged in deliberation with dowager lady Chia as to this necessary and
LINE 148: to that requirement, when suddenly they descried a waiting-maid arrive,
LINE 149: who announced: "Master wishes to see Pao-yü."
LINE 150: Pao-yü gazed vacantly for a while. His spirits simultaneously were swept
LINE 151: away; his countenance changed colour; and clinging to old lady Chia, he
LINE 152: readily wriggled her about, just as one would twist the sugar (to make
LINE 153: sweetmeats with), and could not, for the very death of him, summon up
LINE 154: courage to go; so that her ladyship had no alternative but to try and
LINE 155: reassure him. "My precious darling" she urged, "just you go, and I'll
LINE 156: stand by you! He won't venture to be hard upon you; and besides, you've
LINE 157: devised these excellent literary compositions; and I presume as Her
LINE 158: Majesty has desired that you should move into the garden, his object is
LINE 159: to give you a few words of advice; simply because he fears that you
LINE 160: might be up to pranks in those grounds. But to all he tells you,
LINE 161: whatever you do, mind you acquiesce and it will be all right!"
LINE 162: And as she tried to compose him, she at the same time called two old
LINE 163: nurses and enjoined them to take Pao-yü over with due care, "And don't
LINE 164: let his father," she added, "frighten him!"
LINE 165: The old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-yü felt constrained to
LINE 166: walk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, he
LINE 167: leisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was in
LINE 168: madame Wang's apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other,
LINE 169: and Chin Ch'uan-erh, Ts'ai Yun, Ts'ai Feng, Ts'ai Luan, Hsiu Feng and
LINE 170: the whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under the
LINE 171: verandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they puckered up their
LINE 172: mouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch'uan grasped Pao-yü with one
LINE 173: hand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: "On these lips of mine has
LINE 174: just been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclined
LINE 175: to lick it or not?" whereupon Ts'ai Yün pushed off Chin Ch'uan with one
LINE 176: shove, as she interposed laughingly, "A person's heart is at this moment
LINE 177: in low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But avail
LINE 178: yourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make haste
LINE 179: and get in!"
LINE 180: Pao-yü had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Cheng
LINE 181: and madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chou
LINE 182: raised the portière. Pao-yü stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Cheng
LINE 183: and madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch,
LINE 184: engaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch'un,
LINE 185: T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them were
LINE 186: seated in there only T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan rose to their
LINE 187: feet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and when
LINE 188: Chia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-yü standing in front of him,
LINE 189: with a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, so
LINE 190: captivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, and
LINE 191: how coarse his deportment. But suddenly he also bethought himself of
LINE 192: Chia Chu, and as he reflected too that madame Wang had only this son of
LINE 193: her own flesh and blood, upon whom she ever doated as upon a gem, and
LINE 194: that his own beard had already begun to get hoary, the consequence was
LINE 195: that he unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, the feeling of hatred
LINE 196: and dislike, which, during the few recent years he had ordinarily
LINE 197: fostered towards Pao-yü. And after a long pause, "Her Majesty," he
LINE 198: observed, "bade you day after day ramble about outside to disport
LINE 199: yourself, with the result that you gradually became remiss and lazy; but
LINE 200: now her desire is that we should keep you under strict control, and that
LINE 201: in prosecuting your studies in the company of your cousins in the
LINE 202: garden, you should carefully exert your brains to learn; so that if you
LINE 203: don't again attend to your duties, and mind your regular tasks, you had
LINE 204: better be on your guard!" Pao-yü assented several consecutive yes's;
LINE 205: whereupon madame Wang drew him by her side and made him sit down, and
LINE 206: while his three cousins resumed the seats they previously occupied:
LINE 207: "Have you finished all the pills you had been taking a short while
LINE 208: back?" madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-yü's neck.
LINE 209: "There's still one pill remaining," Pao-yü explained by way of reply.
LINE 210: "You had better," madame Wang added, "fetch ten more pills tomorrow
LINE 211: morning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you;
LINE 212: and when you've had one you can go to sleep!"
LINE 213: "Ever since you, mother, bade me take them," Pao-yü rejoined, "Hsi Jen
LINE 214: has daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in."
LINE 215: "Who's this called Hsi Jen?" Chia Chen thereupon ascertained.
LINE 216: "She's a waiting-maid!" madame Wang answered.
LINE 217: "A servant girl," Chia Cheng remonstrated, "can be called by whatever
LINE 218: name one chooses; anything is good enough; but who's it who has started
LINE 219: this kind of pretentious name!"
LINE 220: Madame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, so
LINE 221: that she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-yü, by saying: "It's
LINE 222: our old lady who has originated it!"
LINE 223: "How can it possibly be," Chia Cheng exclaimed, "that her ladyship knows
LINE 224: anything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, be
LINE 225: Pao-yü!"
LINE 226: Pao-yü perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, was
LINE 227: under the necessity of standing up and of explaining; "As I have all
LINE 228: along read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet:
LINE 229: "What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the
LINE 230: day is warm.
LINE 231: "And as this waiting-maid's surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her
LINE 232: the name, on the strength of this sentiment."
LINE 233: "When you get back," madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-yü,
LINE 234: "change it and have done; and you, sir, needn't lose your temper over
LINE 235: such a trivial matter!"
LINE 236: "It doesn't really matter in the least," Chia Cheng continued; "so that
LINE 237: there's no necessity of changing it; but it's evident that Pao-yü
LINE 238: doesn't apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his
LINE 239: energies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!" And as he
LINE 240: finished these words, he abruptly shouted out: "You brute-like child of
LINE 241: retribution! Don't you yet get out of this?"
LINE 242: "Get away, off with you!" madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge;
LINE 243: "our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!"
LINE 244: Pao-yü assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room,
LINE 245: laughing at Chin Ch'uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading off
LINE 246: the two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke. But no
LINE 247: sooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jen
LINE 248: standing leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-yü come back safe
LINE 249: and sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: "What did he want you
LINE 250: for?"
LINE 251: "There was nothing much," Pao-yü explained, "he simply feared that I
LINE 252: would, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all
LINE 253: sorts of advice;" and, as while he explained matters, they came into the
LINE 254: presence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last,
LINE 255: of what had transpired. But when he saw that Lin Tai-yü was at the
LINE 256: moment in the room, Pao-yü speedily inquired of her: "Which place do you
LINE 257: think best to live in?"
LINE 258: Tai-yü had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she
LINE 259: unexpectedly heard Pao-yü's inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a
LINE 260: smile: "My own idea is that the Hsio Hsiang Kuan is best; for I'm fond
LINE 261: of those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous
LINE 262: balustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any
LINE 263: other!"
LINE 264: Pao-yü at these words clapped his hands and smiled. "That just meets
LINE 265: with my own views!" he remarked; "I too would like you to go and live in
LINE 266: there; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in the
LINE 267: first place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secluded
LINE 268: spots."
LINE 269: While the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by Chia
LINE 270: Cheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: "The 22nd of the second moon
LINE 271: was a propitious day for Pao-yü and the young ladies to shift their
LINE 272: quarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should be
LINE 273: sent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that Hsueh
LINE 274: Pao-ch'ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-yü was to
LINE 275: live in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch'un should move into
LINE 276: the Cho Chin two-storied building; that T'an Ch'un should put up in the
LINE 277: Ch'iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch'un should take up her quarters in the
LINE 278: Liao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village,
LINE 279: and that Pao-yü was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place two
LINE 280: old nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of the
LINE 281: nurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, be
LINE 282: servants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and to
LINE 283: sweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, move
LINE 284: into the garden."
LINE 285: When this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with the
LINE 286: flowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by the
LINE 287: fragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been in
LINE 288: previous days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details,
LINE 289: we shall now go back to Pao-yü.
LINE 290: Ever since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full of
LINE 291: joy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinary
LINE 292: ideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings.
LINE 293: Day after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousins
LINE 294: and the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writing
LINE 295: characters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing pictures
LINE 296: and scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, in
LINE 297: embroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strange
LINE 298: plants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone,
LINE 299: singing ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playing
LINE 300: at mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was of
LINE 301: course completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the times
LINE 302: of the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon as
LINE 303: first-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a true
LINE 304: account of the scenery.
LINE 305: The ballad on the spring night runs as follows:
LINE 306: The silken curtains, thin as russet silk, at random are spread out.
LINE 307: The croak of frogs from the adjoining lane but faintly strikes the
LINE 308: ear.
LINE 309: The pillow a slight chill pervades, for rain outside the window falls.
LINE 310: The landscape, which now meets the eye, is like that seen in dreams by
LINE 311: man.
LINE 312: In plenteous streams the candles' tears do drop, but for whom do they
LINE 313: weep?
LINE 314: Each particle of grief felt by the flowers is due to anger against me.
LINE 315: It's all because the maids have by indulgence indolent been made.
LINE 316: The cover over me I'll pull, as I am loth to laugh and talk for long.
LINE 317: This is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night:
LINE 318: The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long
LINE 319: dream.
LINE 320: The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to
LINE 321: brew.
LINE 322: The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors
LINE 323: look;
LINE 324: The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial
LINE 325: scents.
LINE 326: From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the
LINE 327: lotus.
LINE 328: The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow
LINE 329: trees.
LINE 330: In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time
LINE 331: do wave.
LINE 332: In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made
LINE 333: the night's toilette.
LINE 334: The landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted:
LINE 335: In the interior of the Chiang Yün house are hushed all clamorous din
LINE 336: and noise.
LINE 337: The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation
LINE 338: gauze.
LINE 339: The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged
LINE 340: in sleep.
LINE 341: The dew, blown on the t'ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting
LINE 342: rooks.
LINE 343: Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to
LINE 344: spread.
LINE 345: The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the
LINE 346: kingfisher flowers!
LINE 347: This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long
LINE 348: for wine.
LINE 349: The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to
LINE 350: be brewed.
LINE 351: The picture of a winter night is in this strain:
LINE 352: The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch
LINE 353: have already reached.
LINE 354: Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can't
LINE 355: sleep for the cold.
LINE 356: The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that
LINE 357: meet the eye.
LINE 358: Both far and wide the pear blossom covers the ground, but yet the hawk
LINE 359: cannot be heard.
LINE 360: The wish, verses to write, fostered by the damsel with the green
LINE 361: sleeves, has waxéd cold.
LINE 362: The master, with the gold sable pelisse, cannot endure much wine.
LINE 363: But yet he doth rejoice that his attendant knows the way to brew the
LINE 364: tea.
LINE 365: The newly-fallen snow is swept what time for tea the water must be
LINE 366: boiled.
LINE 367: But putting aside Pao-yü, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning some
LINE 368: verses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at that
LINE 369: time, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court the
LINE 370: influential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses were
LINE 371: composed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve or
LINE 372: thirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sang
LINE 373: their praise far and wide. There were besides another sort of
LINE 374: light-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious and
LINE 375: seductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls,
LINE 376: and time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to the
LINE 377: above reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came in
LINE 378: search of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches and
LINE 379: to beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction of
LINE 380: Pao-yü, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attention
LINE 381: to these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that he
LINE 382: could ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit of
LINE 383: restlessness? Of a sudden, one day he began to feel discontent, finding
LINE 384: fault with this and turning up his nose at that; and going in and coming
LINE 385: out he was simply full of ennui. And as all the girls in the garden were
LINE 386: just in the prime of youth, and at a time of life when, artless and
LINE 387: unaffected, they sat and reclined without regard to retirement, and
LINE 388: disported themselves and joked without heed, how could they ever have
LINE 389: come to read the secrets which at this time occupied a place in the
LINE 390: heart of Pao-yü? But so unhappy was Pao-yü within himself that he soon
LINE 391: felt loth to stay in the garden, and took to gadding about outside like
LINE 392: an evil spirit; but he behaved also the while in an idiotic manner.
LINE 393: Ming Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with the
LINE 394: idea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and to
LINE 395: devise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeit
LINE 396: by Pao-yü, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself to
LINE 397: him,) of which Pao-yü had not as yet had any experience. Bringing his
LINE 398: reflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, and
LINE 399: selecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditions
LINE 400: intended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t'ien, and
LINE 401: Yang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting of
LINE 402: strange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the express
LINE 403: purpose of enticing Pao-yü to read them. As soon as Pao-yü caught sight
LINE 404: of them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. "But you
LINE 405: mustn't," Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, "take them into the garden;
LINE 406: for if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall then
LINE 407: suffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hide
LINE 408: them in your clothes!"
LINE 409: But would Pao-yü agree to not introducing them into the garden? So after
LINE 410: much wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose style
LINE 411: was more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of his
LINE 412: bed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse and
LINE 413: very indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.
LINE 414: On one day, which happened to be the middle decade of the third moon,
LINE 415: Pao-yü, after breakfast, took a book, the "Hui Chen Chi," in his hand
LINE 416: and walked as far as the bridge of the Hsin Fang lock. Seating himself
LINE 417: on a block of rock, that lay under the peach trees in that quarter, he
LINE 418: opened the Hui Chen Chi and began to read it carefully from the
LINE 419: beginning. But just as he came to the passage: "the falling red
LINE 420: (flowers) have formed a heap," he felt a gust of wind blow through the
LINE 421: trees, bringing down a whole bushel of peach blossoms; and, as they
LINE 422: fell, his whole person, the entire surface of the book as well as a
LINE 423: large extent of ground were simply bestrewn with petals of the blossoms.
LINE 424: Pao-yü was bent upon shaking them down; but as he feared lest they
LINE 425: should be trodden under foot, he felt constrained to carry the petals in
LINE 426: his coat and walk to the bank of the pond and throw them into the
LINE 427: stream. The petals floated on the surface of the water, and, after
LINE 428: whirling and swaying here and there, they at length ran out by the Hsin
LINE 429: Fang lock. But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground again
LINE 430: one mass of petals, and Pao-yü was just hesitating what to do, when he
LINE 431: heard some one behind his back inquire, "What are you up to here?" and
LINE 432: as soon as Pao-yü turned his head round, he discovered that it was Lin
LINE 433: Tai-yü, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for raking
LINE 434: flowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in her
LINE 435: hand she held a broom.
LINE 436: "That's right, well done!" Pao-yü remarked smiling; "come and sweep
LINE 437: these flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I've just thrown a
LINE 438: lot in there myself!"
LINE 439: "It isn't right," Lin Tai-yü rejoined, "to throw them into the water.
LINE 440: The water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it finds
LINE 441: its way out, where are situated other people's grounds, what isn't there
LINE 442: in it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as if
LINE 443: you left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers,
LINE 444: and I'll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury them
LINE 445: in there; and, in course of many days, they will also become converted
LINE 446: into earth, and won't this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?"
LINE 447: Pao-yü, after listening to these words, felt inexpressibly delighted.
LINE 448: "Wait!" he smiled, "until I put down my book, and I'll help you to clear
LINE 449: them up!"
LINE 450: "What's the book?" Tai-yü inquired.
LINE 451: Pao-yü at this question was so taken aback that he had no time to
LINE 452: conceal it. "It's," he replied hastily, "the Chung Yung and the Ta
LINE 453: Hsüeh!"
LINE 454: "Are you going again to play the fool with me? Be quick and give it to
LINE 455: me to see; and this will be ever so much better a way!"
LINE 456: "Cousin," Pao-yü replied, "as far as you yourself are concerned I don't
LINE 457: mind you, but after you've seen it, please don't tell any one else. It's
LINE 458: really written in beautiful style; and were you to once begin reading
LINE 459: it, why even for your very rice you wouldn't have a thought?"
LINE 460: As he spoke, he handed it to her; and Tai-yü deposited all the flowers
LINE 461: on the ground, took over the book, and read it from the very first page;
LINE 462: and the more she perused it, she got so much the more fascinated by it,
LINE 463: that in no time she had finished reading sixteen whole chapters. But
LINE 464: aroused as she was to a state of rapture by the diction, what remained
LINE 465: even of the fascination was enough to overpower her senses; and though
LINE 466: she had finished reading, she nevertheless continued in a state of
LINE 467: abstraction, and still kept on gently recalling the text to mind, and
LINE 468: humming it to herself.
LINE 469: "Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?" Pao-yü grinned.
LINE 470: "It is indeed full of zest!" Lin Tai-yü replied exultingly.
LINE 471: "I'm that very sad and very sickly person," Pao-yü explained laughing,
LINE 472: "while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrow
LINE 473: the city."
LINE 474: Lin Tai-yü became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over her
LINE 475: cheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, her
LINE 476: two eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening wide
LINE 477: those eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while her
LINE 478: peach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurked
LINE 479: displeasure, she pointed at Pao-yü and exclaimed: "You do deserve death,
LINE 480: for the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up these
LINE 481: licentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all this
LINE 482: insolent rot, in order to insult me; but I'll go and tell uncle and
LINE 483: aunt."
LINE 484: As soon as she pronounced the two words "insult me," her eyeballs at
LINE 485: once were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there and
LINE 486: then walked away; which filled Pao-yü with so much distress that he
LINE 487: jumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: "My dear cousin, I
LINE 488: earnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I've indeed said what I
LINE 489: shouldn't; but if I had any intention to insult you, I'll throw myself
LINE 490: to-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so
LINE 491: that I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have
LINE 492: by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you
LINE 493: shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I'll come
LINE 494: to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!"
LINE 495: As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of
LINE 496: "pu ch'ih," and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: "I too can
LINE 497: come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking
LINE 498: nonsense? Pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)
LINE 499: like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!"
LINE 500: "Go on, go on!" Pao-yü smiled after this remark; "and what you've said,
LINE 501: I too will go and tell!"
LINE 502: "You maintain," Lin Tai-yü rejoined sarcastically, "that after glancing
LINE 503: at anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that I
LINE 504: can't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?"
LINE 505: Pao-yü smiled and put his book away, urging: "Let's do what's right and
LINE 506: proper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let us
LINE 507: allude to these things!"
LINE 508: Forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner
LINE 509: had they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, who
LINE 510: went on to observe: "Where haven't I looked for you? What! have you
LINE 511: found your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, over
LINE 512: there isn't well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay their
LINE 513: respects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so go
LINE 514: back at once and change your clothes!"
LINE 515: When Pao-yü heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, and
LINE 516: saying good bye to Tai-yü, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into his
LINE 517: room, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in his
LINE 518: costume. But during this while, Lin Tai-yü was, after having seen Pao-yü
LINE 519: walk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in their
LINE 520: rooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towards
LINE 521: her apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of the
LINE 522: Pear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, the
LINE 523: harmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voices
LINE 524: singing. Lin Tai-yü readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girls
LINE 525: rehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go and
LINE 526: listen, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, and
LINE 527: with such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden was
LINE 528: this:
LINE 529: These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in
LINE 530: this way all round do bloom,
LINE 531: And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the
LINE 532: dilapidated wall!
LINE 533: But the moment Lin Tai-yü heard these lines, she was, in fact, so
LINE 534: intensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending an
LINE 535: ear listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus:
LINE 536: A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart!
LINE 537: Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts?
LINE 538: After overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head,
LINE 539: and sighed, and mused in her own mind. "Really," she thought, "there is
LINE 540: fine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this world
LINE 541: simply know is to see a play, and they don't seem to be able to enjoy
LINE 542: the beauties contained in them."
LINE 543: At the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again a
LINE 544: sting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to such
LINE 545: idle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she once
LINE 546: more came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus:
LINE 547: It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely
LINE 548: spring,
LINE 549: That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.
LINE 550: When this couplet struck Tai-yu's ear, her heart felt suddenly a prey to
LINE 551: excitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words:
LINE 552: Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving
LINE 553: way.
LINE 554: --and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and like
LINE 555: as if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedily
LINE 556: stooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutely
LINE 557: pondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters:
LINE 558: It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely
LINE 559: spring,
LINE 560: That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.
LINE 561: Of a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line:
LINE 562: Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have.
LINE 563: --which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, and
LINE 564: also of the passage:
LINE 565: When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past
LINE 566: and gone;
LINE 567: --and of:
LINE 568: Heaven (differs from) the human race,
LINE 569: --which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, which
LINE 570: she had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi:
LINE 571: The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow!
LINE 572: Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!)
LINE 573: both simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them all
LINE 574: together, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart was
LINE 575: stricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyes
LINE 576: trickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her present
LINE 577: state of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gave
LINE 578: her a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was a
LINE 579: young girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known.
