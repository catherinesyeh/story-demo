LINE 1: The eminent Hsi Jen, with winsome ways, rails at Pao-yü, with a view
LINE 2: to exhortation.
LINE 3: The beauteous P'ing Erh, with soft words, screens Chia Lien.
LINE 4: But to resume our story. When Shih Hsiang-yün ran out of the room, she
LINE 5: was all in a flutter lest Lin Tai-yü should catch her up; but Pao-yü,
LINE 6: who came after her, readily shouted out, "You'll trip and fall. How ever
LINE 7: could she come up to you?"
LINE 8: Lin Tai-yü went in pursuit of her as far as the entrance, when she was
LINE 9: impeded from making further progress by Pao-yü, who stretched his arms
LINE 10: out against the posts of the door.
LINE 11: "Were I to spare Yün Erh, I couldn't live!" Lin Tai-yü exclaimed, as she
LINE 12: tugged at his arms. But Hsiang-yün, perceiving that Pao-yü obstructed
LINE 13: the door, and surmising that Tai-yü could not come out, speedily stood
LINE 14: still. "My dear cousin," she smilingly pleaded, "do let me off this
LINE 15: time!"
LINE 16: But it just happened that Pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at the
LINE 17: back of Hsiang-yün, and with a face also beaming with smiles: "I advise
LINE 18: you both," she said, "to leave off out of respect for cousin Pao-yü, and
LINE 19: have done."
LINE 20: "I don't agree to that," Tai-yü rejoined; "are you people, pray, all of
LINE 21: one mind to do nothing but make fun of me?"
LINE 22: "Who ventures to make fun of you?" Pao-yü observed advisingly; "and
LINE 23: hadn't you made sport of her, would she have presumed to have said
LINE 24: anything about you?"
LINE 25: While this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand one
LINE 26: another, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and they
LINE 27: eventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already time
LINE 28: for the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying
LINE 29: Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and the other cousins, adjourned in a body
LINE 30: to dowager lady Chia's apartments on this side, where the whole company
LINE 31: spent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they each
LINE 32: returned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-yün, as of old,
LINE 33: betook herself to Tai-yü's quarters to rest, and Pao-yü escorted them
LINE 34: both into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already past
LINE 35: the second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times,
LINE 36: that he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. The
LINE 37: next morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him,
LINE 38: put on his low shoes and came over into Tai-yü's room, where he however
LINE 39: saw nothing of the two girls Tzu Chüan and Ts'ui Lu, as there was no one
LINE 40: else here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under the
LINE 41: coverlets. Tai-yü was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, and
LINE 42: lying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-yün, with
LINE 43: her handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, was
LINE 44: covered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curved
LINE 45: snow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on.
LINE 46: At the sight of her, Pao-yü heaved a sigh. "Even when asleep," he
LINE 47: soliloquised, "she can't be quiet! but by and by, when the wind will
LINE 48: have blown on her, she'll again shout that her shoulder is sore!" With
LINE 49: these words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-yü had already awoke out
LINE 50: of her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, she
LINE 51: promptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-yü, and turning
LINE 52: herself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truth
LINE 53: was not beyond her conjectures, she observed: "What have you run over to
LINE 54: do at this early hour?" to which question Pao-yü replied: "Do you call
LINE 55: this early? but get up and see for yourself!"
LINE 56: "First quit the room," Tai-yü suggested, "and let us get up!"
LINE 57: Pao-yü thereupon made his exit into the ante-chamber, and Tai-yü jumped
LINE 58: out of bed, and awoke Hsiang-yün. When both of them had put on their
LINE 59: clothes, Pao-yü re-entered and took a seat by the side of the toilet
LINE 60: table; whence he beheld Tzu-chüan and Hsüeh Yen walk in and wait upon
LINE 61: them, as they dressed their hair and performed their ablutions.
LINE 62: Hsiang-yün had done washing her face, and Ts'üi Lü at once took the
LINE 63: remaining water and was about to throw it away, when Pao-yü interposed,
LINE 64: saying: "Wait, I'll avail myself of this opportunity to wash too and
LINE 65: finish with it, and thus save myself the trouble of having again to go
LINE 66: over!" Speaking the while, he hastily came forward, and bending his
LINE 67: waist, he washed his face twice with two handfuls of water, and when Tzu
LINE 68: Chüan went over to give him the scented soap, Pao-yü added: "In this
LINE 69: basin, there's a good deal of it, and there's no need of rubbing any
LINE 70: more!" He then washed his face with two more handfuls, and forthwith
LINE 71: asked for a towel, and Ts'üi Lü exclaimed: "What! have you still got
LINE 72: this failing? when will you turn a new leaf?" But Pao-yü paid not so
LINE 73: much as any heed to her, and there and then called for some salt, with
LINE 74: which he rubbed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth. When he had done, he
LINE 75: perceived that Hsiang-yün had already finished combing her hair, and
LINE 76: speedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: "My dear cousin,
LINE 77: comb my hair for me!"
LINE 78: "This can't be done!" Hsiang-yün objected.
LINE 79: "My dear cousin," Pao-yü continued smirkingly, "how is it that you
LINE 80: combed it for me in former times?"
LINE 81: "I've forgotten now how to comb it!" Hsiang-yün replied.
LINE 82: "I'm not, after all, going out of doors," Pao-yü observed, "nor will I
LINE 83: wear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a few
LINE 84: queues, that's all!" Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in a
LINE 85: thousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-yün had no alternative,
LINE 86: but to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another,
LINE 87: and as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, any
LINE 88: tufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all four
LINE 89: sides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together over
LINE 90: the hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding it
LINE 91: fast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of the
LINE 92: queue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, was
LINE 93: suspended a golden pendant.
LINE 94: "Of these pearls there are only three," Hsiang-yün remarked as she went
LINE 95: on plaiting; "this isn't one like them; I remember these were all of one
LINE 96: kind, and how is it that there's one short?"
LINE 97: "I've lost one," Pao-yü rejoined.
LINE 98: "It must have dropped," Hsiang-yün added, "when you went out of doors,
LINE 99: and been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he's
LINE 100: now, instead of you, the richer for it."
LINE 101: "One can neither tell whether it has been really lost," Tai-yü, who
LINE 102: stood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; "nor could one
LINE 103: say whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in some
LINE 104: trinket or other and worn!"
LINE 105: Pao-yü made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the
LINE 106: dressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,
LINE 107: taking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Grasping
LINE 108: unawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would have
LINE 109: liked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lest
LINE 110: Hsiang-yün should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so or
LINE 111: not, Hsiang-yün, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him a
LINE 112: smack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out:
LINE 113: "You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!"
LINE 114: But hardly had she had time to complete this remark, when she caught
LINE 115: sight of Hsi Jen walk in, who upon perceiving this state of things,
LINE 116: became aware that he was already combed and washed, and she felt
LINE 117: constrained to go back and attend to her own coiffure and ablutions. But
LINE 118: suddenly, she saw Pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: "Where's cousin Pao-yü
LINE 119: gone?"
LINE 120: "Do you mean to say," Hsi Jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, "that
LINE 121: your cousin Pao-yü has leisure to stay at home?"
LINE 122: When Pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,
LINE 123: and when she further heard Hsi Jen remark with a sigh: "Cousins may well
LINE 124: be on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of
LINE 125: propriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matter
LINE 126: how people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past the
LINE 127: ears." Pao-ch'ai began, at these remarks, to cogitate within her mind:
LINE 128: "May I not, possibly, have been mistaken in my estimation of this girl;
LINE 129: for to listen to her words, she would really seem to have a certain
LINE 130: amount of _savoir faire_!"
LINE 131: Pao-ch'ai thereupon took a seat on the stove-couch, and quietly, in the
LINE 132: course of their conversation on one thing and another, she managed to
LINE 133: ascertain her age, her native village and other such particulars, and
LINE 134: then setting her mind diligently to put, on the sly, her conversation
LINE 135: and mental capacity to the test, she discovered how deeply worthy she
LINE 136: was to be respected and loved. But in a while Pao-yü arrived, and
LINE 137: Pao-ch'ai at once quitted the apartment.
LINE 138: "How is it," Pao-yü at once inquired, "that cousin Pao-ch'ai was
LINE 139: chatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me
LINE 140: enter, she promptly ran away?"
LINE 141: Hsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only
LINE 142: when he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: "Do you ask me? How can I
LINE 143: know what goes on between you two?"
LINE 144: When Pao-yü heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face
LINE 145: was so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile
LINE 146: and asking: "Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?"
LINE 147: "How could I presume to get angry!" Hsi Jen rejoined smiling
LINE 148: indifferently; "but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot into
LINE 149: this room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn't
LINE 150: come again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend to
LINE 151: our old mistress, as in days of old."
LINE 152: With this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on the
LINE 153: stove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-yü perceived the state of mind
LINE 154: she was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from coming
LINE 155: forward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed and
LINE 156: paid no heed to him, so that Pao-yü was quite at a loss how to act. But
LINE 157: espying She Yüeh enter the room, he said with alacrity: "What's up with
LINE 158: your sister?"
LINE 159: "Do I know?" answered She Yüeh, "examine your own self and you'll
LINE 160: readily know!"
LINE 161: After these words had been heard by Pao-yü, he gazed vacantly for some
LINE 162: time, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously:
LINE 163: "Well!" he exclaimed, "if you don't notice me, all right, I too will go
LINE 164: to sleep," and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, he
LINE 165: betook himself to his own bed and went to sleep. Hsi Jen noticing that
LINE 166: he had not budged for ever so long, and that he faintly snored, presumed
LINE 167: that he must have fallen fast asleep, so she speedily rose to her feet,
LINE 168: and, taking a wrapper, came over and covered him. But a sound of "hu"
LINE 169: reached her ear, as Pao-yü promptly threw it off and once again closed
LINE 170: his eyes and feigned sleep. Hsi Jen distinctly grasped his idea and,
LINE 171: forthwith nodding her head, she smiled coldly. "You really needn't lose
LINE 172: your temper! but from this time forth, I'll become mute, and not say one
LINE 173: word to you; and what if I do?"
LINE 174: Pao-yü could not restrain himself from rising. "What have I been up to
LINE 175: again," he asked, "that you're once more at me with your advice? As far
LINE 176: as your advice goes, it's all well and good; but just now without one
LINE 177: word of counsel, you paid no heed to me when I came in, but, flying into
LINE 178: a huff, you went to sleep. Nor could I make out what it was all about,
LINE 179: and now here you are again maintaining that I'm angry. But when did I
LINE 180: hear you, pray, give me a word of advice of any kind?"
LINE 181: "Doesn't your mind yet see for itself?" Hsi Jen replied; "and do you
LINE 182: still expect me to tell you?"
LINE 183: While they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call him
LINE 184: to his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after he
LINE 185: had hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his own
LINE 186: apartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outer
LINE 187: stove-couch, while She Yüeh was playing with the dominoes by her side.
LINE 188: Pao-yü had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between She
LINE 189: Yüeh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even She
LINE 190: Yüeh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone into
LINE 191: the inner apartment. She Yüeh felt constrained to follow him in, but
LINE 192: Pao-yü at once pushed her out, saying: "I don't venture to disturb you
LINE 193: two;" so that She Yüeh had no alternative but to leave the room with a
LINE 194: smiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-yü
LINE 195: took hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a reclining
LINE 196: position; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sight
LINE 197: of a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightly
LINE 198: older than the other, was exceedingly winsome.
LINE 199: "What's your name?" Pao-yü eagerly inquired.
LINE 200: "I'm called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)," that waiting-maid rejoined
LINE 201: simperingly.
LINE 202: "Who gave you this name?" Pao-yü went on to ask.
LINE 203: "I went originally under the name of Yün Hsiang (Gum Sandarac)," added
LINE 204: Hui Hsiang, "but Miss Hua it was who changed it."
LINE 205: "You should really be called Hui Ch'i, (latent fragrance), that would be
LINE 206: proper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?"
LINE 207: "How many sisters have you got?" he further went on to ask of her.
LINE 208: "Four," replied Hui Hsiang.
LINE 209: "Which of them are you?" Pao-yü asked.
LINE 210: "The fourth," answered Hui Hsiang.
LINE 211: "By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child)," Pao-yü
LINE 212: suggested, "for there's no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang
LINE 213: (orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch'i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girl
LINE 214: deserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning pretty
LINE 215: names and fine surnames!"
LINE 216: As he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which he
LINE 217: drank; while Hsi Jen and She Yüeh, who were in the outer apartment, had
LINE 218: been listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.
LINE 219: Pao-yü did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door of
LINE 220: his room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up his
LINE 221: books, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself with
LINE 222: his writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of the
LINE 223: services of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answer
LINE 224: his calls.
LINE 225: This Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted with
LINE 226: matchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-yü had requisitioned her
LINE 227: services, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means to
LINE 228: inveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-yü's eyes were
LINE 229: scorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of wine
LINE 230: that he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had Hsi
LINE 231: Jen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer and
LINE 232: laughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on this
LINE 233: occasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with an
LINE 234: absolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go after
LINE 235: them, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in the
LINE 236: future, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were he
LINE 237: to put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear to
LINE 238: be too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say,
LINE 239: thwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they were
LINE 240: dead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though he
LINE 241: was, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, and
LINE 242: did not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary,
LINE 243: he was able to feel happy and contented with his own society. Hence it
LINE 244: was that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himself
LINE 245: perused for a time the "Nan Hua Ching," and upon reaching the precept:
LINE 246: "On thieves," given on some additional pages, the burden of which was:
LINE 247: "Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discarding
LINE 248: knowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off the
LINE 249: jade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring to
LINE 250: existence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, by
LINE 251: smashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be that
LINE 252: the people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wise
LINE 253: rules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to take
LINE 254: part in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, and
LINE 255: destroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang,
LINE 256: then, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense of
LINE 257: hearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the five
LINE 258: colours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankind
LINE 259: under the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. By
LINE 260: destroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the
LINE 261: compasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui's fingers, the human
LINE 262: race will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,"--his high
LINE 263: spirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking
LINE 264: advantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen,
LINE 265: for he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise:
LINE 266: "By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She
LINE 267: Yüeh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers
LINE 268: will, eventually, keep advice to themselves. By obliterating Pao-ch'ai's
LINE 269: supernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-yü's spiritual perception,
LINE 270: and by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, the
LINE 271: beautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, at
LINE 272: length, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice to
LINE 273: themselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliterating
LINE 274: her supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violent
LINE 275: affection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have no
LINE 276: feelings with which to foster the memory of her talents. The hair-pin,
LINE 277: jade, flower and musk (Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yü, Hsi Jen and She Yüeh) do each
LINE 278: and all spread out their snares and dig mines, and thus succeed in
LINE 279: inveigling and entrapping every one in the world."
LINE 280: At the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himself
LINE 281: down to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at once
LINE 282: fell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconscious
LINE 283: of everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking and
LINE 284: turning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else than
LINE 285: Hsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet.
LINE 286: Pao-yü had already banished from his mind every thought of what had
LINE 287: transpired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push:
LINE 288: "Get up!" he said, "and be careful where you sleep, as you may catch
LINE 289: cold."
LINE 290: The fact is that Hsi Jen was aware that he was, without regard to day or
LINE 291: night, ever up to mischief with his female cousins; but presuming that
LINE 292: if she earnestly called him to account, he would not mend his ways, she
LINE 293: had, for this reason, had recourse to tender language to exhort him, in
LINE 294: the hope that, in a short while, he would come round again to his better
LINE 295: self. But against all her expectations Pao-yü had, after the lapse of a
LINE 296: whole day and night, not changed the least in his manner, and as she
LINE 297: really was in her heart quite at a loss what to do, she failed to find
LINE 298: throughout the whole night any proper sleep. But when on this day, she
LINE 299: unexpectedly perceived Pao-yü in this mood, she flattered herself that
LINE 300: he had made up his mind to effect a change, and readily thought it best
LINE 301: not to notice him. Pao-yü, seeing that she made no reply, forthwith
LINE 302: stretched out his hand and undid her jacket; but he had just unclasped
LINE 303: the button, when his arm was pushed away by Hsi Jen, who again made it
LINE 304: fast herself.
LINE 305: Pao-yü was so much at his wit's ends that he had no alternative but to
LINE 306: take her hand and smilingly ask: "What's the matter with you, after all,
LINE 307: that I've had to ask you something time after time?"
LINE 308: Hsi Jen opened her eyes wide. "There's nothing really the matter with
LINE 309: me!" she observed; "but as you're awake, you surely had better be going
LINE 310: over into the opposite room to comb your hair and wash; for if you
LINE 311: dilly-dally any longer, you won't be in time."
LINE 312: "Where shall I go over to?" Pao-yü inquired.
LINE 313: Hsi Jen gave a sarcastic grin. "Do you ask me?" she rejoined; "do I
LINE 314: know? you're at perfect liberty to go over wherever you like; from this
LINE 315: day forth you and I must part company so as to avoid fighting like cocks
LINE 316: or brawling like geese, to the amusement of third parties. Indeed, when
LINE 317: you get surfeited on that side, you come over to this, where there are,
LINE 318: after all, such girls as Fours and Fives (Ssu Erh and Wu Erh) to dance
LINE 319: attendance upon you. But such kind of things as ourselves uselessly
LINE 320: defile fine names and fine surnames."
LINE 321: "Do you still remember this to-day!" Pao-yü asked with a smirk.
LINE 322: "Hundred years hence I shall still bear it in mind," Hsi Jen protested;
LINE 323: "I'm not like you, who treat my words as so much wind blowing by the
LINE 324: side of your ears, that what I've said at night, you've forgotten early
LINE 325: in the morning."
LINE 326: Pao-yü perceiving what a seductive though angry air pervaded her face
LINE 327: found it difficult to repress his feelings, and speedily taking up, from
LINE 328: the side of the pillow, a hair-pin made of jade, he dashed it down
LINE 329: breaking it into two exclaiming: "If I again don't listen to your words,
LINE 330: may I fare like this hair-pin."
LINE 331: Hsi Jen immediately picked up the hair-pin, as she remarked: "What's up
LINE 332: with you at this early hour of the morning? Whether you listen or not is
LINE 333: of no consequence; and is it worth while that you should behave as you
LINE 334: do?"
LINE 335: "How can you know," Pao-yü answered, "the anguish in my heart!"
LINE 336: "Do you also know what anguish means?" Hsi Jen observed laughing; "if
LINE 337: you do, then you can judge what the state of my heart is! But be quick
LINE 338: and get up, and wash your face and be off!"
LINE 339: As she spoke, they both got out of bed and performed their toilette; but
LINE 340: after Pao-yü had gone to the drawing rooms, and at a moment least
LINE 341: expected by any one, Tai-yü walked into his apartment. Noticing that
LINE 342: Pao-yü was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table and
LINE 343: examining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the Chuang
LINE 344: Tzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-yü,
LINE 345: she could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could she
LINE 346: restrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to this
LINE 347: effect:
LINE 348: Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use,
LINE 349: A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal,
LINE 350: Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel,
LINE 351: But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse?
LINE 352: At the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into the
LINE 353: drawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, she
LINE 354: walked over to madame Wang's quarters.
LINE 355: Contrary to everybody's expectations, lady Feng's daughter, Ta Chieh
LINE 356: Erh, had fallen ill, and a great fuss was just going on as the doctor
LINE 357: had been sent for to diagnose her ailment.
LINE 358: "My congratulations to you, ladies," the doctor explained; "this young
LINE 359: lady has fever, as she has small-pox; indeed it's no other complaint!"
LINE 360: As soon as madame Wang and lady Feng heard the tidings, they lost no
LINE 361: time in sending round to ascertain whether she was getting on all right
LINE 362: or not, and the doctor replied: "The symptoms are, it is true, serious,
LINE 363: but favourable; but though after all importing no danger, it's necessary
LINE 364: to get ready the silkworms and pigs' tails."
LINE 365: When lady Feng received this report, she, there and then, hastened to
LINE 366: make the necessary preparations, and while she had the rooms swept and
LINE 367: oblations offered to the goddess of small-pox, she, at the same time,
LINE 368: transmitted orders to her household to avoid viands fried or roasted in
LINE 369: fat, or other such heating things; and also bade P'ing Erh get ready the
LINE 370: bedding and clothes for Chia Lien in a separate room, and taking pieces
LINE 371: of deep red cotton material, she distributed them to the nurses,
LINE 372: waiting-maids and all the servants, who were in close attendance, to cut
LINE 373: out clothes for themselves. And having had likewise some apartments
LINE 374: outside swept clean, she detained two doctors to alternately deliberate
LINE 375: on the treatment, feel the pulse and administer the medicines; and for
LINE 376: twelve days, they were not at liberty to return to their homes; while
LINE 377: Chia Lien had no help but to move his quarters temporarily into the
LINE 378: outer library, and lady Feng and P'ing Erh remained both in daily
LINE 379: attendance upon madame Wang in her devotions to the goddess.
LINE 380: Chia Lien, now that he was separated from lady Feng, soon felt disposed
LINE 381: to look round for a flame. He had only slept alone for a couple of
LINE 382: nights, but these nights had been so intensely intolerable that he had
LINE 383: no option than to choose, for the time being, from among the young
LINE 384: pages, those who were of handsome appearance, and bring them over to
LINE 385: relieve his monotony. In the Jung Kuo mansion, there was, it happened, a
LINE 386: cook, a most useless, good-for-nothing drunkard, whose name was To Kuan,
LINE 387: in whom people recognised an infirm and a useless husband so that they
LINE 388: all dubbed him with the name of To Hun Ch'ung, the stupid worm To. As
LINE 389: the wife given to him in marriage by his father and mother was this year
LINE 390: just twenty, and possessed further several traits of beauty, and was
LINE 391: also naturally of a flighty and frivolous disposition, she had an
LINE 392: extreme penchant for violent flirtations. But To Hun-ch'ung, on the
LINE 393: other hand, did not concern himself (with her deportment), and as long
LINE 394: as he had wine, meat and money he paid no heed whatever to anything. And
LINE 395: for this reason it was that all the men in the two mansions of Ning and
LINE 396: Jung had been successful in their attentions; and as this woman was
LINE 397: exceptionally fascinating and incomparably giddy, she was generally
LINE 398: known by all by the name To Ku Ning (Miss To).
LINE 399: Chia Lien, now that he had his quarters outside, chafed under the pangs
LINE 400: of irksome ennui, yet he too, in days gone by, had set his eyes upon
LINE 401: this woman, and had for long, watered in the mouth with admiration; but
LINE 402: as, inside, he feared his winsome wife, and outside, he dreaded his
LINE 403: beloved lads, he had not made any advances. But this To Ku Niang had
LINE 404: likewise a liking for Chia Lien, and was full of resentment at the
LINE 405: absence of a favourable opportunity; but she had recently come to hear
LINE 406: that Chia Lien had shifted his quarters into the outer library, and her
LINE 407: wont was, even in the absence of any legitimate purpose, to go over
LINE 408: three and four times to entice him on; but though Chia Lien was, in
LINE 409: every respect, like a rat smitten with hunger, he could not dispense
LINE 410: with holding consultation with the young friends who enjoyed his
LINE 411: confidence; and as he struck a bargain with them for a large amount of
LINE 412: money and silks, how could they ever not have come to terms (with him to
LINE 413: speak on his behalf)? Besides, they were all old friends of this woman,
LINE 414: so that, as soon as they conveyed the proposal, she willingly accepted
LINE 415: it. When night came To Hun Ch'ung was lying on the couch in a state of
LINE 416: drunkenness, and at the second watch, when every one was quiet, Chia
LINE 417: Lien at once slipped in, and they had their assignation. As soon as he
LINE 418: gazed upon her face, he lost control over his senses, and without even
LINE 419: one word of ordinary greeting or commonplace remark, they forthwith,
LINE 420: fervently indulged in a most endearing tête-à-tête.
LINE 421: This woman possessed, who could have thought it, a strange natural
LINE 422: charm; for, as soon as any one of her lovers came within any close
LINE 423: distance of her, he speedily could not but notice that her very tendons
LINE 424: and bones mollified, paralysed-like from feeling, so that his was the
LINE 425: sensation of basking in a soft bower of love. What is more, her
LINE 426: demonstrative ways and free-and-easy talk put even those of a born
LINE 427: coquette to shame, with the result that while Chia Lien, at this time,
LINE 428: longed to become heart and soul one with her, the woman designedly
LINE 429: indulged in immodest innuendoes.
LINE 430: "Your daughter is at home," she insinuated in her recumbent position,
LINE 431: "ill with the small-pox, and prayers are being offered to the goddess;
LINE 432: and your duty too should be to abstain from love affairs for a couple of
LINE 433: days, but on the contrary, by flirting with me, you've contaminated
LINE 434: yourself! but, you'd better be off at once from me here!"
LINE 435: "You're my goddess!" gaspingly protested Chia Lien, as he gave way to
LINE 436: demonstrativeness; "what do I care about any other goddess!"
LINE 437: The woman began to be still more indelicate in her manner, so that Chia
LINE 438: Lien could not refrain himself from making a full exhibition of his warm
LINE 439: sentiments. When their tête-à-tête had come to a close, they both went
LINE 440: on again to vow by the mountains and swear by the seas, and though they
LINE 441: found it difficult to part company and hard to tear themselves away,
LINE 442: they, in due course, became, after this occasion, mutual sworn friends.
LINE 443: But by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh's system had become
LINE 444: exhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days the
LINE 445: goddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices to
LINE 446: heaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense,
LINE 447: exchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And these
LINE 448: formalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his own
LINE 449: bedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed true
LINE 450: which says: "That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation," for
LINE 451: there ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still more
LINE 452: numerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer with
LINE 453: any minuteness.
LINE 454: The next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upper
LINE 455: rooms, P'ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding,
LINE 456: which had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation,
LINE 457: a tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intent
LINE 458: upon shaking it. P'ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once the
LINE 459: hair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over into
LINE 460: the room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly asked
LINE 461: Chia Lien, "What's this?"
LINE 462: Chia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with the
LINE 463: idea of depriving her of it; and when P'ing Erh speedily endeavoured to
LINE 464: run away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on the
LINE 465: stove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand.
LINE 466: "You heartless fellow!" P'ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, "I conceal this,
LINE 467: with every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you about
LINE 468: it, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comes
LINE 469: back, and I'll tell her, and we'll see what will happen."
LINE 470: At these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. "Dear girl!" he
LINE 471: entreated, "give it to me, and I won't venture again to fly into a
LINE 472: passion."
LINE 473: But hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of lady
LINE 474: Feng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of Chia
LINE 475: Lien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatch
LINE 476: it away, and kept on shouting, "My dear girl! don't let her know."
LINE 477: P'ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already entered
LINE 478: the room; and she went on to bid P'ing Erh be quick and open a box and
LINE 479: find a pattern for madame Wang. P'ing Erh expressed her obedience with
LINE 480: alacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of Chia
LINE 481: Lien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P'ing Erh
LINE 482: about it.
LINE 483: "The other day," she observed, "some things were taken out, and have you
LINE 484: brought them all in or not?"
LINE 485: "I have!" P'ing Erh assented.
LINE 486: "Is there anything short or not?" lady Feng inquired.
LINE 487: "I've carefully looked at them," P'ing Erh added, "and haven't found
LINE 488: even one single thing short."
LINE 489: "Is there anything in excess?" lady Feng went on to ascertain.
LINE 490: P'ing Erh laughed. "It's enough," she rejoined, "that there's nothing
LINE 491: short; and how could there really turn out to be anything over and
LINE 492: above?"
LINE 493: "That this half month," lady Feng continued still smiling, "things have
LINE 494: gone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friend
LINE 495: there may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in the
LINE 496: shape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there's no saying
LINE 497: for certain!"
LINE 498: While these words were being spoken, Chia Lien's face turned perfectly
LINE 499: sallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing at
LINE 500: P'ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat as
LINE 501: a chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) and
LINE 502: entreating her to screen him; but P'ing Erh pretended not to notice him,
LINE 503: and consequently observed smiling: "How is it that my ideas should
LINE 504: coincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there may
LINE 505: have been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but I
LINE 506: didn't find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don't
LINE 507: believe me, my lady, you can search for your own self."
LINE 508: "You fool!" lady Feng laughed, "had he any things of the sort, would he
LINE 509: be likely to let you and I discover them!"
LINE 510: With these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went her
LINE 511: way; whereupon P'ing Erh pointed at her nose, and shook her head to and
LINE 512: fro. "In this matter," she smiled, "how much you should be grateful to
LINE 513: me!" A remark which so delighted Chia Lien that his eyebrows distended,
LINE 514: and his eyes smiled, and running over, he clasped her in his embrace,
LINE 515: and called her promiscuously: "My darling, my pet, my own treasure!"
LINE 516: "This," observed P'ing Erh, with the tress in her hand, "will be my
LINE 517: source of power, during all my lifetime! if you treat me kindly, then
LINE 518: well and good! but if you behave unkindly, then we'll at once produce
LINE 519: this thing!"
LINE 520: "Do put it away, please," Chia Lien entreated smirkingly, "and don't, on
LINE 521: an any account, let her know about it!" and as he uttered these words,
LINE 522: he noticed that she was off her guard, and, with a snatch, readily
LINE 523: grabbed it adding laughingly: "In your hands, it would be a source of
LINE 524: woe, so that it's better that I should burn it, and have done with it!"
LINE 525: Saying this he simultaneously shoved it down the sides of his boot,
LINE 526: while P'ing Erh shouted as she set her teeth close: "You wicked man! you
LINE 527: cross the river and then demolish the bridge! but do you imagine that
LINE 528: I'll by and by again tell lies on your behalf!"
LINE 529: Chia Lien perceiving how heart-stirring her seductive charms were,
LINE 530: forthwith clasped her in his arms, and begged her to be his; but P'ing
LINE 531: Erh snatched her hands out of his grasp and ran away out of the room;
LINE 532: which so exasperated Chia Lien that as he bent his body, he exclaimed,
LINE 533: full of indignation: "What a dreadful niggardly young wench! she
LINE 534: actually sets her mind to stir up people's affections with her wanton
LINE 535: blandishments, and then, after all, she runs away!"
LINE 536: "If I be wanton, it's my own look-out;" P'ing Erh answered, from outside
LINE 537: the window, with a grin, "and who told you to arouse your affections? Do
LINE 538: you forsooth mean to imply that my wish is to become your tool? And did
LINE 539: she come to know about it would she again ever forgive me?"
LINE 540: "You needn't dread her!" Chia Lien urged; "wait till my monkey is up,
LINE 541: and I'll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she'll then
LINE 542: know what stuff I'm made of. She watches me just as she would watch a
LINE 543: thief! and she's only to hobnob with men, and I'm not to say a word to
LINE 544: any girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, she
LINE 545: must at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to younger
LINE 546: brothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles with
LINE 547: them, and doesn't entertain any fear that I may be jealous; but
LINE 548: henceforward I too won't allow her to set eyes upon any man."
LINE 549: "If she be jealous, there's every reason," P'ing Erh answered, "but for
LINE 550: you to be jealous on her account isn't right. Her conduct is really
LINE 551: straightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct is
LINE 552: actuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don't feel my heart at
LINE 553: ease, not to say anything of her."
LINE 554: "You two," continued Chia Lien, "have a mouth full of malicious breath!
LINE 555: Everything the couple of you do is invariably proper, while whatever I
LINE 556: do is all from an evil heart! But some time or other I shall bring you
LINE 557: both to your end with my own hands!"
LINE 558: This sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into the
LINE 559: court. "If you're bent upon chatting," she urgently inquired, upon
LINE 560: seeing P'ing Erh outside the window, "why don't you go into the room?
LINE 561: and what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with the
LINE 562: window between?"
LINE 563: Chia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. "You
LINE 564: should ask her," he said. "It would verily seem as if there were a tiger
LINE 565: in the room to eat her up."
LINE 566: "There's not a single person in the room," P'ing Erh rejoined, "and what
LINE 567: shall I stay and do with him?"
LINE 568: "It's just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn't it?"
LINE 569: lady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically.
LINE 570: "Do these words allude to me?" P'ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as she
LINE 571: had heard what she said.
LINE 572: Lady Feng forthwith laughed. "If they don't allude to you," she
LINE 573: continued, "to whom do they?"
LINE 574: "Don't press me to come out with some nice things!" P'ing Erh
LINE 575: insinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (for
LINE 576: lady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the opposite
LINE 577: side.
LINE 578: Lady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into the
LINE 579: room. "That girl P'ing Erh," she exclaimed, "has gone mad, and if this
LINE 580: hussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, it
LINE 581: would be well for you to mind your skin."
LINE 582: Chia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. "I never
LINE 583: in the least knew," he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, "that
LINE 584: P'ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth look
LINE 585: up to her with respect!"
LINE 586: "It's all through your humouring her," lady Feng rejoined; "so I'll
LINE 587: simply settle scores with you and finish with it."
LINE 588: "Ts'ui!" ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, "because you two can't
LINE 589: agree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I'll get out of
LINE 590: the way of both of you!"
LINE 591: "I'll see where you'll go and hide," lady Feng observed.
LINE 592: "I've got somewhere to go!" Chia Lien added; and with these words, he
LINE 593: was about to go, when lady Feng urged: "Don't be off! I have something
LINE 594: to tell you."
LINE 595: What it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account given
LINE 596: in the next chapter.
