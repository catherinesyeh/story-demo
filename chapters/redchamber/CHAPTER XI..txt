LINE 1: In honour of Chia Ching's birthday, a family banquet is spread in the
LINE 2: Ning Mansion.
LINE 3: At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious
LINE 4: love.
LINE 5: We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of
LINE 6: Chia Ching's birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious
LINE 7: delicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present
LINE 8: boxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging
LINE 9: to the household, over to Chia Ching.
LINE 10: Turning round towards Chia Jung: "Mind," he said, "that you observe
LINE 11: whether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and
LINE 12: pay your obeisance! 'My father,' tell him, 'has complied with your
LINE 13: directions, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has
LINE 14: at home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into
LINE 15: your apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of
LINE 16: honour.'"
LINE 17: After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off
LINE 18: the family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, one
LINE 19: by one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to
LINE 20: see whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). "Is there
LINE 21: to be any entertainment or not?" they also inquired.
LINE 22: "Our master," replied the servants, "had, at one time, intended to
LINE 23: invite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home,
LINE 24: and hadn't for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But
LINE 25: when the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not
LINE 26: coming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young
LINE 27: actors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now
LINE 28: engaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden."
LINE 29: Next came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-yü,
LINE 30: followed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu's mother
LINE 31: having already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutations
LINE 32: were exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one another
LINE 33: to take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.
LINE 34: "Our venerable lady," they explained, as they smiled, "is a worthy
LINE 35: senior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so that
LINE 36: on a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had the
LINE 37: audacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, is
LINE 38: cool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriant
LINE 39: blossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a little
LINE 40: distraction, and to see the whole number of her children and
LINE 41: grand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view,
LINE 42: but, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not again
LINE 43: conferred upon us the lustre of her countenance."
LINE 44: Lady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but took
LINE 45: the initiative to reply. "Our venerable lady," she urged, "had, even so
LINE 46: late as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening,
LINE 47: upon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady once
LINE 48: again began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the half
LINE 49: of one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed two
LINE 50: consecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, she
LINE 51: felt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform our
LINE 52: worthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day;
LINE 53: adding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a few
LINE 54: kinds, but that they should be very tender."
LINE 55: When Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. "Our dowager lady," he
LINE 56: replied, "is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn't come
LINE 57: to-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that's
LINE 58: exactly what happens to be the case."
LINE 59: "The other day I heard your eldest sister explain," interposed madame
LINE 60: Wang, "that Chia Jung's wife was anything but well; but what's after all
LINE 61: the matter with her?"
LINE 62: "She has," observed Mrs. Yu, "contracted this illness verily in a
LINE 63: strange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she
LINE 64: was still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the
LINE 65: night, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return,
LINE 66: she continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began
LINE 67: to feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat
LINE 68: anything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and
LINE 69: more; she hasn't besides been anything like her old self for two
LINE 70: months."
LINE 71: "May she not," remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the
LINE 72: conversation, "be ailing for some happy event?"
LINE 73: But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:
LINE 74: "Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the family
LINE 75: have come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!" Whereupon Chia Chen
LINE 76: and Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this
LINE 77: while, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also
LINE 78: expressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that
LINE 79: the previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying--a
LINE 80: doctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very
LINE 81: proficient in the treatment of diseases,--who asserted, after he had
LINE 82: seen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave
LINE 83: complaint. "It was only yesterday," (she explained,) "that he wrote his
LINE 84: prescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day
LINE 85: the giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other
LINE 86: symptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement."
LINE 87: "I maintain," remarked lady Feng, "that, were she not quite unfit to
LINE 88: stand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling
LINE 89: to strain every nerve and come round."
LINE 90: "You saw her," observed Mrs. Yu, "on the third in here; how that she
LINE 91: bore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because
LINE 92: of the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for
LINE 93: your society, and couldn't brook the idea of tearing herself away."
LINE 94: When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a
LINE 95: time she at length exclaimed: "In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and
LINE 96: rain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But
LINE 97: with her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any
LINE 98: risk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to
LINE 99: sojourn in the world?"
LINE 100: She was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; and
LINE 101: after paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng,
LINE 102: he then observed to Mrs. Yu: "I have just taken over the eatables to our
LINE 103: venerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father was
LINE 104: at home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemen
LINE 105: of the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather's orders,
LINE 106: he did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted by
LINE 107: what he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order,
LINE 108: bade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in your
LINE 109: attendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me to
LINE 110: entertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He also
LINE 111: went on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, the
LINE 112: blocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousand
LINE 113: copies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to my
LINE 114: father, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatables
LINE 115: for the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entire
LINE 116: household."
LINE 117: "Brother Jung Erh," exclaimed lady Feng, "wait a moment. How is your
LINE 118: wife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?"
LINE 119: "Not well," replied Chia Jung. "But were you, aunt, on your return to go
LINE 120: in and see her, you will find out for yourself."
LINE 121: Chia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yu
LINE 122: addressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; "My ladies," she asked,
LINE 123: "will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for
LINE 124: it? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making
LINE 125: their preparations?"
LINE 126: "It's better in here," madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards
LINE 127: madame Hsing.
LINE 128: Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to
LINE 129: be quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the
LINE 130: door, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went
LINE 131: off to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were
LINE 132: all laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as
LINE 133: her mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and
LINE 134: Pao-yü, sat at a side table.
LINE 135: "We've come," observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, "with the original idea
LINE 136: of paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of
LINE 137: his birthday; and isn't this as if we had come for our own birthdays?"
LINE 138: "The old gentleman," answered lady Feng, "is a man fond of a quiet life;
LINE 139: and as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well
LINE 140: be looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which
LINE 141: your ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to
LINE 142: his spirit, upon the very advent of the intention."
LINE 143: As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out
LINE 144: laughing. Mrs. Yu's mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng
LINE 145: having one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths and
LINE 146: washed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into the
LINE 147: garden.
LINE 148: Chia Jung entered the room. "The senior gentlemen," he said to Mrs. Yu,
LINE 149: "as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; but
LINE 150: the elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score of
LINE 151: having at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng),
LINE 152: who is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid that
LINE 153: people will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of them
LINE 154: taken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been taken
LINE 155: over by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listen
LINE 156: to the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P'ing, Prince
LINE 157: Hsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of Chen
LINE 158: Kuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching,
LINE 159: and other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers with
LINE 160: their cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; but
LINE 161: before I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, the
LINE 162: lists of presents were all entered in the book, and the 'received with
LINE 163: thanks' cards were handed to the respective messengers of the various
LINE 164: mansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner,
LINE 165: and all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went on
LINE 166: their way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your mother
LINE 167: and my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden."
LINE 168: "Just so!" observed Mrs. Yu, "but we've only now finished our repast,
LINE 169: and were about to go over."
LINE 170: "I wish to tell you, madame," interposed lady Feng, "that I shall go
LINE 171: first and see brother Jung's wife and then come and join you."
LINE 172: "All right," replied madame Wang; "we should all have been fain to have
LINE 173: paid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our
LINE 174: disturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to
LINE 175: know how she is getting on!"
LINE 176: "My dear sister," remarked Mrs. Yu, "as our son's wife has a ready ear
LINE 177: for all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will
LINE 178: besides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you
LINE 179: can into the garden."
LINE 180: Pao-yü being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady
LINE 181: Ch'in, madame Wang remarked, "Go and see her just for a while, and then
LINE 182: come over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew's
LINE 183: wife, (and you couldn't sit in there long)."
LINE 184: Mrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her own
LINE 185: mother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked into
LINE 186: the garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-yü betook
LINE 187: themselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.
LINE 188: Having entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as the
LINE 189: entrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch'in, upon catching sight of them,
LINE 190: was bent upon getting up; but "Be quick," remonstrated lady Feng, "and
LINE 191: give up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feel
LINE 192: dizzy."
LINE 193: Lady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs.
LINE 194: Ch'in's hand in hers. "My dear girl!" she exclaimed; "How is it that
LINE 195: during the few days I've not seen you, you have grown so thin?"
LINE 196: Readily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch'in was seated,
LINE 197: while Pao-yü, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair on
LINE 198: the opposite side.
LINE 199: "Bring the tea in at once," called out Chia Jung, "for aunt and uncle
LINE 200: Secundus have not had any tea in the drawing room."
LINE 201: Mrs. Ch'in took lady Feng's hand in her own and forced a smile. "This is
LINE 202: all due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, my
LINE 203: father and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of their
LINE 204: own flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it is
LINE 205: true, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me,
LINE 206: as I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstanding
LINE 207: between us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of the
LINE 208: same age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, about
LINE 209: whom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever had
LINE 210: anything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anything
LINE 211: but kindness! But since I've fallen ill with this complaint, all my
LINE 212: energy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I've been
LINE 213: unable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filial
LINE 214: attention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt,
LINE 215: with all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutiful
LINE 216: to the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I'm really not equal to
LINE 217: it; my own idea is, that it isn't likely that I shall last through this
LINE 218: year."
LINE 219: Pao-yü kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture
LINE 220: on the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring
LINE 221: time, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch'in
LINE 222: Tai-hsü:
LINE 223: A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring
LINE 224: is cold!
LINE 225: The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume
LINE 226: of wine!
LINE 227: And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when
LINE 228: he had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited
LINE 229: the confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of
LINE 230: abstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch'in give utterance to these
LINE 231: sentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows,
LINE 232: (with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.
LINE 233: Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within
LINE 234: herself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the
LINE 235: patient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of
LINE 236: benefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite
LINE 237: the purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and
LINE 238: consolation. "Pao-yü," she therefore exclaimed, "you are like an old
LINE 239: woman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever
LINE 240: could things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so
LINE 241: that after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!"
LINE 242: "Don't," she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch'in, "give way to silly
LINE 243: thoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won't you yourself be
LINE 244: aggravating your ailment?"
LINE 245: "All that her sickness in fact needs," observed Chia Jung, "is, that she
LINE 246: should be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothing
LINE 247: to fear."
LINE 248: "Brother Pao," urged lady Feng, "your mother told you to go over, as
LINE 249: soon as you could, so that don't stay here, and go on in the way you're
LINE 250: doing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart.
LINE 251: Besides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account." "You had
LINE 252: better go ahead with your uncle Pao," she consequently continued,
LINE 253: addressing herself to Chia Jung, "while I sit here a little longer."
LINE 254: When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-yü
LINE 255: into the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both
LINE 256: to cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a
LINE 257: good deal of confidential advice.
LINE 258: Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry
LINE 259: lady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch'in: "Do all you can to take good
LINE 260: care of yourself, and I'll come and see you again. You're bound to get
LINE 261: over this illness; and now, in fact, that you've come across that
LINE 262: renowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear."
LINE 263: "He might," observed Mrs. Ch'in as she smiled, "even be a supernatural
LINE 264: being and succeed in healing my disease, but he won't be able to remedy
LINE 265: my destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of
LINE 266: mine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day."
LINE 267: "If you encourage such ideas," remonstrated lady Feng, "how can this
LINE 268: illness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all
LINE 269: these notions, and then you'll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor
LINE 270: asserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the
LINE 271: worse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a
LINE 272: family that hadn't the means to afford any ginseng, it would be
LINE 273: difficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and
LINE 274: mother-in-law to hear that it's good for your recovery, why not to speak
LINE 275: of two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within
LINE 276: their means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I'm now off
LINE 277: on my way into the garden."
LINE 278: "Excuse me, my dear aunt," added Mrs. Ch'in, "that I can't go with you;
LINE 279: but when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me!
LINE 280: and you and I can sit and have a long chat."
LINE 281: After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite
LINE 282: red again. "When I'm at leisure I shall, of course," she rejoined, "come
LINE 283: often to see you;" and forthwith leading off the matrons and married
LINE 284: women, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of
LINE 285: the Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and
LINE 286: entered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she
LINE 287: perceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking
LINE 288: the slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh;
LINE 289: zigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid
LINE 290: springs dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges
LINE 291: emitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves
LINE 292: on the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped
LINE 293: of foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of
LINE 294: the oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the
LINE 295: cicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a
LINE 296: distance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting
LINE 297: against the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west,
LINE 298: stretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of
LINE 299: music filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and
LINE 300: maidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional
LINE 301: spell to the scene.
LINE 302: Lady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot,
LINE 303: advanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy,
LINE 304: when suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed a
LINE 305: person, who approached her and facing her said, "My respects to you,
LINE 306: sister-in-law."
LINE 307: Lady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drew
LINE 308: back. "Isn't this Mr. Jui?" she ventured.
LINE 309: "What! sister-in-law," exclaimed Chia Jui, "don't you recognise even
LINE 310: me?"
LINE 311: "It isn't that I didn't recognise you," explained lady Feng, "but at the
LINE 312: sudden sight of you, I couldn't conceive that it would possibly be you,
LINE 313: sir, in this place!"
LINE 314: "This was in fact bound to be," replied Chia Jui; "for there's some
LINE 315: subtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I just
LINE 316: stealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while in
LINE 317: this solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you,
LINE 318: sister-in-law; and isn't this a subtle sympathy?"
LINE 319: As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an
LINE 320: intelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at
LINE 321: the whole truth in her surmises. "It isn't to be wondered at," she
LINE 322: consequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, "that your eldest
LINE 323: brother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after
LINE 324: seeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I
LINE 325: have readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I
LINE 326: am just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no
LINE 327: leisure to converse with you; but wait until I've nothing to attend to,
LINE 328: when we can meet again."
LINE 329: "I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you,
LINE 330: sister-in-law," pleaded Chia Jui, "but I was afraid lest a person of
LINE 331: tender years like yourself mightn't lightly receive any visitors!"
LINE 332: Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. "Relatives," she continued, "of
LINE 333: one family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender
LINE 334: years?"
LINE 335: After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him
LINE 336: with such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: "I have at length
LINE 337: to-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter
LINE 338: with her!"
LINE 339: But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng
LINE 340: urged him to go. "Be off at once," she remarked, "and join the
LINE 341: entertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so
LINE 342: many glasses of wine!"
LINE 343: By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui's ears, half of his
LINE 344: body had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away,
LINE 345: with lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. Lady
LINE 346: Feng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had
LINE 347: gone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. "This is indeed,"
LINE 348: she thought, "knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart!
LINE 349: Can there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to
LINE 350: behave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my
LINE 351: own hands, and he'll then know what stuff I'm made of."
LINE 352: Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a
LINE 353: chain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along
LINE 354: with all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile.
LINE 355: "Our mistress," they said, "perceiving that your ladyship was not
LINE 356: forthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your
LINE 357: servants come again to request you to come over.
LINE 358: "Is your mistress," observed lady Feng, "so like a quick-footed demon?"
LINE 359: While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, "How many plays have
LINE 360: been recited?" to which question one of the matrons replied, "They have
LINE 361: gone through eight or nine." But while engaged in conversation, they had
LINE 362: already reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where
LINE 363: she caught sight of Pao-yü playing with a company of waiting-maids and
LINE 364: pages. "Brother Pao," lady Feng exclaimed, "don't be up to too much
LINE 365: mischief!" "The ladies are all sitting upstairs," interposed one of the
LINE 366: maids. "Please, my lady, this is the way up."
LINE 367: At these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, and
LINE 368: walked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of the
LINE 369: landing waiting for her.
LINE 370: "You two," remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, "are so friendly, that having met
LINE 371: you couldn't possibly tear yourself away to come. You had better
LINE 372: to-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and have
LINE 373: done; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass of
LINE 374: wine."
LINE 375: Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged
LINE 376: permission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and
LINE 377: pressed lady Feng to mark some plays.
LINE 378: "The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour," remonstrated lady Feng,
LINE 379: "and how can I presume to choose?"
LINE 380: "We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,"
LINE 381: explained mesdames Hsing and Wang, "and it's for you now to choose some
LINE 382: good ones for us to listen to."
LINE 383: Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the
LINE 384: programme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one
LINE 385: entitled, the "Return of the Spirit," and another called "Thrumming and
LINE 386: Singing;" after which she handed back the programme, observing, "When
LINE 387: they have done with the 'Ennoblement of two Officers,' which they are
LINE 388: singing just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two."
LINE 389: "Of course it will," retorted madame Wang, "but they should get it over
LINE 390: as soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and your
LINE 391: Sister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease."
LINE 392: "You senior ladies don't come often," expostulated Mrs. Yu, "and you and
LINE 393: I will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it's as
LINE 394: yet early in the day!"
LINE 395: Lady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. "Where have all the gentlemen
LINE 396: gone to?" she inquired.
LINE 397: "The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of Plenteous
LINE 398: Effulgence," replied a matron, who stood by; "they have taken along with
LINE 399: them ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine."
LINE 400: "It wasn't convenient for them," remarked lady Feng, "to be over here;
LINE 401: but who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?"
LINE 402: "Could every one," interposed Mrs. Yu, "resemble you, a person of such
LINE 403: propriety!"
LINE 404: While they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosen
LINE 405: were all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, and
LINE 406: the repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned into
LINE 407: the garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they at
LINE 408: length gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leave
LINE 409: of Mrs. Yu's mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives,
LINE 410: servants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, along
LINE 411: with the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in a
LINE 412: group for their arrival.
LINE 413: After saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, "Aunts," they said, "you must
LINE 414: come over again to-morrow for a stroll."
LINE 415: "We must be excused," observed madame Wang, "we've sat here the whole
LINE 416: day to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shall
LINE 417: need to have some rest to-morrow."
LINE 418: Both of them thereupon got into their carriages and took their
LINE 419: departure, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and it
LINE 420: was after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, and
LINE 421: that Pao-yü mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdames
LINE 422: Hsing and Wang.
LINE 423: Chia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to the
LINE 424: family had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the whole
LINE 425: party at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of the
LINE 426: clan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need
LINE 427: not advert to it with any minuteness.
LINE 428: After this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visits
LINE 429: to Mrs. Ch'in; but as there were some days on which her ailment was
LINE 430: considerably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, Chia
LINE 431: Chen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.
LINE 432: Chia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances,
LINE 433: on a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he found
LINE 434: that lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.
LINE 435: This was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which the
LINE 436: winter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowager
LINE 437: lady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by without
LINE 438: sending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch'in; and as the servants, on
LINE 439: their return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days,
LINE 440: neither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any marked
LINE 441: improvement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as a
LINE 442: complaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without getting
LINE 443: any worse, there was some hope of recovery.
LINE 444: "Of course there is!" observed the old lady; "what a dear child she is!
LINE 445: should anything happen to her, won't it be enough to make people die
LINE 446: from grief!" and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart.
LINE 447: "You and she," continuing, she said to lady Feng, "have been friends for
LINE 448: ever so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can't go), but
LINE 449: after to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise her
LINE 450: appearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on your
LINE 451: return! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, do
LINE 452: send her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!"
LINE 453: Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second
LINE 454: arrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs.
LINE 455: Ch'in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh
LINE 456: all over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched
LINE 457: up. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch'in for a long while, and after they had
LINE 458: chatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances
LINE 459: that this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so
LINE 460: long.
LINE 461: "Whether I get well or not," observed Mrs. Ch'in, "we'll know in spring;
LINE 462: now winter is just over, and I'm anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may
LINE 463: get all right; and yet there's no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do
LINE 464: press our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me
LINE 465: some potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two,
LINE 466: they seem after all to be very easily digested!"
LINE 467: "I'll send you round some more to-morrow," lady Feng suggested; "I'm now
LINE 468: going to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my
LINE 469: report to our dowager lady."
LINE 470: "Please, sister-in-law," Mrs. Ch'in said, "present my best respects to
LINE 471: her venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang."
LINE 472: Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,
LINE 473: forthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu's
LINE 474: suite of rooms.
LINE 475: "How do you, who don't see our son's wife very often, happen to find
LINE 476: her?" inquired Mrs. Yu.
LINE 477: Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. "There's no help," she
LINE 478: ventured, "for this illness! but you should likewise make every
LINE 479: subsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it
LINE 480: away."
LINE 481: "I've done so much as to secretly give orders," replied Mrs. Yu, "to get
LINE 482: things ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there's no good timber to
LINE 483: be found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by."
LINE 484: Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, "I
LINE 485: must be hurrying back," she remarked, "to deliver my message to our
LINE 486: dowager lady!"
LINE 487: "You should," urged Mrs. Yu, "be sparse in what you tell her lady ship
LINE 488: so as not to frighten an old person like her!"
LINE 489: "I know well enough what to say," replied lady Feng.
LINE 490: Without any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival at
LINE 491: home she looked up the old lady. "Brother Jung's wife," she explained,
LINE 492: "presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerable
LINE 493: ladyship; she says that she's much better, and entreats you, her worthy
LINE 494: senior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she's a little better
LINE 495: she will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship."
LINE 496: "How do you find her?" inquired dowager lady Chia.
LINE 497: "For the present there's nothing to fear," continued lady Feng; "for her
LINE 498: mien is still good."
LINE 499: After the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a long
LINE 500: while in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, "Go and
LINE 501: divest yourself of your toilette," she said, "and have some rest."
LINE 502: Lady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away,
LINE 503: returning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P'ing Erh helped lady
LINE 504: Feng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and
LINE 505: lady Feng eventually took a seat and asked "whether there was anything
LINE 506: doing at home?"
LINE 507: P'ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup:
LINE 508: "There's nothing doing," she replied; "as regards the interest on the
LINE 509: three hundred taels, Wang Erh's wife has brought it in, and I've put it
LINE 510: away. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was
LINE 511: at home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a
LINE 512: chat."
LINE 513: "Heng!" exclaimed lady Feng at these words. "Why should this beast
LINE 514: compass his own death? we'll see when he comes what is to be done."
LINE 515: "Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?' P'ing Erh having inquired,
LINE 516: lady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the
LINE 517: course of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said
LINE 518: by him.
LINE 519: "What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly
LINE 520: goose!" ejaculated P'ing Erh. "A stupid and disorderly fellow with no
LINE 521: conception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we'll make
LINE 522: him find an unnatural death!"
LINE 523: "Wait till he comes," added lady Feng, "when I feel certain I shall find
LINE 524: some way."
LINE 525: What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been
LINE 526: ascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next
LINE 527: chapter.
