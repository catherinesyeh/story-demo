LINE 1: Ch'in K'o-ch'ing dies, and Chia Jung is invested with the rank of
LINE 2: military officer to the Imperial Body-guard.
LINE 3: Wang Hsi-feng lends her help in the management of the Jung Kuo
LINE 4: Mansion.
LINE 5: Lady Feng, it must be added, in prosecuting our narrative, was ever
LINE 6: since Chia Lien's departure to accompany Tai-yü to Yang Chou, really
LINE 7: very dejected at heart; and every day, when evening came, she would,
LINE 8: after simply indulging in a chat and a laugh with P'ing Erh, turn in, in
LINE 9: a heedless frame of mind, for the night.
LINE 10: In the course of the night of this day, she had been sitting with P'ing
LINE 11: Erh by lamp-light clasping the hand-stove; and weary of doing her work
LINE 12: of embroidery, she had at an early hour, given orders to warm the
LINE 13: embroidered quilt, and both had gone to bed; and as she was bending her
LINE 14: fingers, counting the progress of the journey, and when they should be
LINE 15: arriving, unexpectedly, the third watch struck.
LINE 16: P'ing Erh had already fallen fast asleep; and lady Feng was feeling at
LINE 17: length her sleepy eyes slightly dose, when she faintly discerned Mrs.
LINE 18: Ch'in walk in from outside.
LINE 19: "My dear sister-in-law," she said as she smiled, "sleep in peace; I'm on
LINE 20: my way back to-day, and won't even you accompany me just one stage? But
LINE 21: as you and I have been great friends all along, I cannot part from you,
LINE 22: sister-in-law, and have therefore come to take my leave of you. There
LINE 23: is, besides, a wish of mine, which isn't yet accomplished; and if I
LINE 24: don't impart it to you, it isn't likely that telling any one else will
LINE 25: be of any use."
LINE 26: Lady Feng could not make out the sense of the words she heard. "What
LINE 27: wish is it you have?" she inquired, "do tell me, and it will be safe
LINE 28: enough with me."
LINE 29: "You are, my dear sister-in-law, a heroine among women," observed Mrs.
LINE 30: Ch'in, "so much so that those famous men, with sashes and official hats,
LINE 31: cannot excel you; how is it that you're not aware of even a couple of
LINE 32: lines of common adages, of that trite saying, 'when the moon is full, it
LINE 33: begins to wane; when the waters are high, they must overflow?' and of
LINE 34: that other which says that 'if you ascend high, heavy must be your
LINE 35: fall.' Our family has now enjoyed splendour and prosperity for already
LINE 36: well-nigh a century, but a day comes when at the height of good fortune,
LINE 37: calamity arises; and if the proverb that 'when the tree falls, the
LINE 38: monkeys scatter,' be fulfilled, will not futile have been the reputation
LINE 39: of culture and old standing of a whole generation?"
LINE 40: Lady Feng at these words felt her heart heavy, and overpowered by
LINE 41: intense awe and veneration.
LINE 42: "The fears you express are well founded," she urgently remarked, "but
LINE 43: what plan is there adequate to preserve it from future injury?"
LINE 44: "My dear sister-in-law," rejoined Mrs. Ch'in with a sardonic smile,
LINE 45: "you're very simple indeed! When woe has reached its climax, weal
LINE 46: supervenes. Prosperity and adversity, from days of yore up to the
LINE 47: present time, now pass away, and now again revive, and how can
LINE 48: (prosperity) be perpetuated by any human exertion? But if now, we could
LINE 49: in the time of good fortune, make provision against any worldly
LINE 50: concerns, which might arise at any season of future adversity, we might
LINE 51: in fact prolong and preserve it. Everything, for instance, is at present
LINE 52: well-regulated; but there are two matters which are not on a sure
LINE 53: footing, and if such and such suitable action could be adopted with
LINE 54: regard to these concerns, it will, in subsequent days, be found easy to
LINE 55: perpetuate the family welfare in its entity."
LINE 56: "What matters are these?" inquired lady Feng.
LINE 57: "Though at the graves of our ancestors," explained Mrs. Ch'in,
LINE 58: "sacrifices and oblations be offered at the four seasons, there's
LINE 59: nevertheless no fixed source of income. In the second place, the family
LINE 60: school is, it is true, in existence; but it has no definite
LINE 61: grants-in-aid. According to my views, now that the times are prosperous,
LINE 62: there's, as a matter of course, no lack of offerings and contributions;
LINE 63: but by and bye, when reverses set in, whence will these two outlays be
LINE 64: met from? Would it not be as well, and my ideas are positive on this
LINE 65: score, to avail ourselves of the present time, when riches and honours
LINE 66: still reign, to establish in the immediate vicinity of our ancestral
LINE 67: tombs, a large number of farms, cottages, and estates, in order to
LINE 68: enable the expenditure for offerings and grants to entirely emanate from
LINE 69: this source? And if the household school were also established on this
LINE 70: principle, the old and young in the whole clan can, after they have, by
LINE 71: common consent, determined upon rules, exercise in days to come control,
LINE 72: in the order of the branches, over the affairs connected with the landed
LINE 73: property, revenue, ancestral worship and school maintenance for the year
LINE 74: (of their respective term.) Under this rotatory system, there will
LINE 75: likewise be no animosities; neither will there be any mortgages, or
LINE 76: sales, or any of these numerous malpractices; and should any one happen
LINE 77: to incur blame, his personal effects can be confiscated by Government.
LINE 78: But the properties, from which will be derived the funds for ancestral
LINE 79: worship, even the officials should not be able to appropriate, so that
LINE 80: when reverses do supervene, the sons and grandsons of the family may be
LINE 81: able to return to their homes, and prosecute their studies, or go in for
LINE 82: farming. Thus, while they will have something to fall back upon, the
LINE 83: ancestral worship will, in like manner, be continued in perpetuity. But,
LINE 84: if the present affluence and splendour be looked upon as bound to go on
LINE 85: without intermission, and with no thought for the day to come, no
LINE 86: enduring plan be after all devised, presently, in a little while, there
LINE 87: will, once again, transpire a felicitous occurrence of exceptional kind,
LINE 88: which, in point of fact, will resemble the splendour of oil scorched on
LINE 89: a violent fire, or fresh flowers decorated with brocades. You should
LINE 90: bear in mind that it will also be nothing more real than a transient
LINE 91: pageant, nothing but a short-lived pleasure! Whatever you do, don't
LINE 92: forget the proverb, that 'there's no banquet, however sumptuous, from
LINE 93: which the guests do not disperse;' and unless you do, at an early date,
LINE 94: take precautions against later evils, regret will, I apprehend, be of no
LINE 95: avail."
LINE 96: "What felicitous occurrence will take place?" lady Feng inquired with
LINE 97: alacrity.
LINE 98: "The decrees of Heaven cannot be divulged; but as I have been very
LINE 99: friendly with you, sister-in-law, for so long, I will present you,
LINE 100: before I take my leave, with two lines, which it behoves you to keep in
LINE 101: mind," rejoined Mrs. Ch'in, as she consequently proceeded to recite what
LINE 102: follows:
LINE 103: The three springs, when over, all radiance will wane;
LINE 104: The inmates to seek each a home will be fain.
LINE 105: Lady Feng was bent upon making further inquiries, when she heard a
LINE 106: messenger at the second gate strike the "cloudy board" four consecutive
LINE 107: blows. It was indeed the announcement of a death; and it woke up lady
LINE 108: Feng with a start. A servant reported that lady Jung of the eastern
LINE 109: mansion was no more.
LINE 110: Lady Feng was so taken aback that a cold perspiration broke out all over
LINE 111: her person, and she fell for a while into vacant abstraction. But she
LINE 112: had to change her costume, with all possible haste, and to come over to
LINE 113: madame Wang's apartments.
LINE 114: By this time, all the members of the family were aware of the tidings,
LINE 115: and there was not one of them who did not feel disconsolate; one and all
LINE 116: of them were much wounded at heart. The elder generation bethought
LINE 117: themselves of the dutiful submission which she had all along displayed;
LINE 118: those of the same age as herself reflected upon the friendship and
LINE 119: intimacy which had ever existed with her; those younger than her
LINE 120: remembered her past benevolence. Even the servants of the household,
LINE 121: whether old or young, looked back upon her qualities of sympathy with
LINE 122: the poor, pity of the destitute, affection for the old, and
LINE 123: consideration for the young; and not one of them all was there who did
LINE 124: not mourn her loss, and give way to intense grief.
LINE 125: But these irrelevant details need not be dilated upon; suffice it to
LINE 126: confine ourselves to Pao-yü.
LINE 127: Consequent upon Lin Tai-yü's return home, he was left to his own self
LINE 128: and felt very lonely. Neither would he go and disport himself with
LINE 129: others; but with the daily return of dusk, he was wont to retire quietly
LINE 130: to sleep.
LINE 131: On this day, while he was yet under the influence of a dream, he heard
LINE 132: the announcement of Mrs. Ch'in's death, and turning himself round
LINE 133: quickly he crept out of bed, when he felt as if his heart had been
LINE 134: stabbed with a sword. With a sudden retch, he straightway expectorated a
LINE 135: mouthful of blood, which so frightened Hsi Jen and the rest that they
LINE 136: rushed forward and supported him.
LINE 137: "What is the matter?" they inquired, and they meant also to go and let
LINE 138: dowager lady Chia know, so as to send for a doctor, but Pao-yü dissuaded
LINE 139: them.
LINE 140: "There's no need of any flurry; it's nothing at all," he said, "it's
LINE 141: simply that the fire of grief has attacked the heart, and that the blood
LINE 142: did not circulate through the arteries."
LINE 143: As he spoke, he speedily raised himself up, and, after asking for his
LINE 144: clothes and changing, he came over to see dowager lady Chia. His wish
LINE 145: was to go at once to the other side; and Hsi Jen, though feeling uneasy
LINE 146: at heart, seeing the state of mind he was in, did not again hinder him,
LINE 147: as she felt constrained to let him please himself.
LINE 148: When old lady Chia saw that he was bent upon going: "The breath is just
LINE 149: gone out of the body," she consequently remonstrated, "and that side is
LINE 150: still sullied. In the second place it's now dark, and the wind is high;
LINE 151: so you had better wait until to-morrow morning, when you will be in
LINE 152: ample time."
LINE 153: Pao-yü would not agree to this, and dowager lady Chia gave orders to get
LINE 154: the carriage ready, and to depute a few more attendants and followers to
LINE 155: go with him. Under this escort he went forward and straightway arrived
LINE 156: in front of the Ning mansion, where they saw the main entrance wide
LINE 157: open, the lamps on the two sides giving out a light as bright as day,
LINE 158: and people coming and going in confused and large numbers; while the
LINE 159: sound of weeping inside was sufficient to shake the mountains and to
LINE 160: move the hills.
LINE 161: Pao-yü dismounted from the carriage; and with hurried step, walked into
LINE 162: the apartment, where the coffin was laid. He gave vent to bitter tears
LINE 163: for a few minutes, and subsequently paid his salutations to Mrs. Yu.
LINE 164: Mrs. Yu, as it happened, had just had a relapse of her old complaint of
LINE 165: pains in the stomach and was lying on her bed.
LINE 166: He eventually came out again from her chamber to salute Chia Chen, just
LINE 167: at the very moment that Chia Tai-ju, Chia Tai-hsiu, Chia Ch'ih, Chiao
LINE 168: Hsiao, Chia Tun, Chia She, Chia Cheng, Chia Tsung, Chia Pin, Chia Hsing,
LINE 169: Chia Kuang, Chia Shen, Chia Ch'iung, Chia Lin, Chia Se, Chia Ch'ang,
LINE 170: Chia Ling, Chia Yün, Chia Ch'in, Chia Chen, Chia P'ing, Chia Tsao, Chia
LINE 171: Heng, Chia Fen, Chia Fang, Chia Lan, Chia Chun, Chia Chih and the other
LINE 172: relatives of the families had likewise arrived in a body.
LINE 173: Chia Chen wept so bitterly that he was like a man of tears. "Of the
LINE 174: whole family, whether young or old, distant relatives or close friends,"
LINE 175: he was just explaining to Chia Tai-ju and the rest, "who did not know
LINE 176: that this girl was a hundred times better than even our son? but now
LINE 177: that her spirit has retired, it's evident that this elder branch of the
LINE 178: family will be cut off and that there will be no survivor."
LINE 179: While he gave vent to these words, he again burst into tears, and the
LINE 180: whole company of relatives set to work at once to pacify him. "She has
LINE 181: already departed this life," they argued, "and tears are also of no
LINE 182: avail, besides the pressing thing now is to consult as to what kind of
LINE 183: arrangements are to be made."
LINE 184: Chia Chen clapped his hands. "What arrangements are to be made!" he
LINE 185: exclaimed; "nothing is to be done, but what is within my means."
LINE 186: As they conversed, they perceived Ch'in Yeh and Ch'in Chung, as well as
LINE 187: several relations of Mrs. Yu, arrive, together with Mrs. Yu's sisters;
LINE 188: and Chia Chen forthwith bade Chia Ch'ung, Chia Shen, Chia Lin and Chia
LINE 189: Se, the four of them, to go and entertain the guests; while he, at the
LINE 190: same time, issued directions to go and ask the Astrologer of the
LINE 191: Imperial Observatory to come and choose the days for the ceremonies.
LINE 192: (This Astrologer) decided that the coffin should remain in the house for
LINE 193: seven times seven days, that is forty-nine days; that after the third
LINE 194: day, the mourning rites should be begun and the formal cards should be
LINE 195: distributed; that all that was to be done during these forty-nine days
LINE 196: was to invite one hundred and eight Buddhist bonzes to perform, in the
LINE 197: main Hall, the High Confession Mass, in order to ford the souls of
LINE 198: departed relatives across the abyss of suffering, and afterwards to
LINE 199: transmute the spirit (of Mrs. Ch'in); that, in addition, an altar should
LINE 200: be erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance, where nine times nine
LINE 201: virtuous Taoist priests should, for nineteen days, offer up prayers for
LINE 202: absolution from punishment, and purification from retribution. That
LINE 203: after these services, the tablet should be moved into the Garden of
LINE 204: Concentrated Fragrance, and that in the presence of the tablet, fifteen
LINE 205: additional eminent bonzes and fifteen renowned Taoist Priests should
LINE 206: confront the altar and perform meritorious deeds every seven days.
LINE 207: The news of the death of the wife of his eldest grandson reached Chia
LINE 208: Ching; but as he himself felt sure that, at no distant date, he would
LINE 209: ascend to the regions above, he was loth to return again to his home,
LINE 210: and so expose himself to the contamination of the world, as to
LINE 211: completely waste the meritorious excellence acquired in past days. For
LINE 212: this reason, he paid no heed to the event, but allowed Chia Chen a free
LINE 213: hand to accomplish the necessary preparations.
LINE 214: Chia Chen, to whom we again revert, was fond of display and
LINE 215: extravagance, so that he found, on inspection of coffins, those few made
LINE 216: of pine-wood unsuitable to his taste; when, strange coincidence, Hsüeh
LINE 217: P'an came to pay his visit of condolence, and perceiving that Chia Chen
LINE 218: was in quest of a good coffin: "In our establishment," he readily
LINE 219: suggested, "we have a lot of timber of some kind or other called Ch'iang
LINE 220: wood, which comes from the T'ieh Wang Mount, in Huang Hai; and which
LINE 221: made into coffins will not rot, not for ten thousand years. This lot
LINE 222: was, in fact, brought down, some years back, by my late father; and had
LINE 223: at one time been required by His Highness I Chung, a Prince of the royal
LINE 224: blood; but as he became guilty of some mismanagement, it was, in
LINE 225: consequence, not used, and is still lying stored up in our
LINE 226: establishment; and another thing besides is that there's no one with the
LINE 227: means to purchase it. But if you do want it, you should come and have a
LINE 228: look at it."
LINE 229: Chia Chen, upon hearing this, was extremely delighted, and gave orders
LINE 230: that the planks should be there and then brought over. When the whole
LINE 231: family came to inspect them, they found those for the sides and the
LINE 232: bottom to be all eight inches thick, the grain like betel-nut, the smell
LINE 233: like sandal-wood or musk, while, when tapped with the hand, the sound
LINE 234: emitted was like that of precious stones; so that one and all agreed in
LINE 235: praising the timber for its remarkable quality.
LINE 236: "What is their price?" Chia Chen inquired with a smile.
LINE 237: "Even with one thousand taels in hand," explained Hsüeh P'an laughingly,
LINE 238: "I feel sure you wouldn't find any place, where you could buy the like.
LINE 239: Why ask about price? if you just give the workmen a few taels for their
LINE 240: labour, it will be quite sufficient."
LINE 241: Chia Chen, at these words, lost no time in giving expression to profuse
LINE 242: assurances of gratitude, and was forthwith issuing directions that the
LINE 243: timber should be split, sawn and made up, when Chia Cheng proffered his
LINE 244: advice. "Such articles shouldn't," he said, "be, in my idea, enjoyed by
LINE 245: persons of the common run; it would be quite ample if the body were
LINE 246: placed in a coffin made of pine of the best quality."
LINE 247: But Chia Chen would not listen to any suggestion.
LINE 248: Suddenly he further heard that Mrs. Ch'in's waiting-maid, Jui Chu by
LINE 249: name, had, after she had become alive to the fact that her mistress had
LINE 250: died, knocked her head against a post, and likewise succumbed to the
LINE 251: blows. This unusual occurrence the whole clan extolled in high terms;
LINE 252: and Chia Chen promptly directed that, with regard to ceremonies, she
LINE 253: should be treated as a granddaughter, and that the body should, after it
LINE 254: had been placed in the coffin, be also deposited in the Hall of Attained
LINE 255: Immortality, in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.
LINE 256: There was likewise a young waiting-maid, called Pao Chu, who, as Mrs.
LINE 257: Ch'in left no issue, was willing to become an adopted child, and begged
LINE 258: to be allowed to undertake the charge of dashing the mourning bowl, and
LINE 259: accompanying the coffin; which pleased Chia Chen so much that he
LINE 260: speedily transmitted orders that from that time forth Pao Chu should be
LINE 261: addressed by all as 'young miss.'
LINE 262: Pao Chu, after the rites of an unmarried daughter, mourned before the
LINE 263: coffin to such an unwonted degree, as if bent upon snapping her own
LINE 264: life; while the members of the entire clan, as well as the inmates of
LINE 265: the Mansions, each and all, readily observed, in their conduct, the
LINE 266: established mourning usages, without of course any transgression or
LINE 267: confusion.
LINE 268: "Chia Jung," pondered Chia Chen, "has no higher status than that of
LINE 269: graduate by purchase, and were this designation written on the funeral
LINE 270: streamer, it will not be imposing, and, in point of fact, the retinue
LINE 271: will likewise be small." He therefore was exceedingly unhappy, in his
LINE 272: own mind, when, as luck would have it, on this day, which was the fourth
LINE 273: day of the first seven, Tai Ch'üan, a eunuch of the Palace of High
LINE 274: Renown, whose office was that of Palace Overseer, first prepared
LINE 275: sacrificial presents, which he sent round by messengers, and next came
LINE 276: himself in an official chair, preceded by criers beating the gong, to
LINE 277: offer sacrificial oblations.
LINE 278: Chia Chen promptly received him, and pressed him into a seat; and when
LINE 279: they adjourned into the Hall of the Loitering Bees, tea was presented.
LINE 280: Chia Chen had already arrived at a fixed purpose, so that he seized an
LINE 281: opportunity to tell him of his wish to purchase an office for Chia
LINE 282: Jung's advancement.
LINE 283: Tai Ch'üan understood the purport of his remark. "It is, I presume," he
LINE 284: added smilingly, "that the funeral rites should be a little more
LINE 285: sumptuous."
LINE 286: "My worthy sir," eagerly rejoined Chia Chen, "your surmise on that score
LINE 287: is perfectly correct."
LINE 288: "The question," explained Tai Ch'üan, "comes up at an opportune moment;
LINE 289: for there is just at present a good vacancy. Of the three hundred
LINE 290: officers who at present constitute the Imperial Body Guard, there are
LINE 291: two wanting. Yesterday marquis Hsiang Yang's third brother came to
LINE 292: appeal to me with one thousand five hundred taels of ready money, which
LINE 293: he brought over to my house. You know the friendship of old standing
LINE 294: which exists between him and me, so that, placing other considerations
LINE 295: aside, I without a second thought, assented for his father's sake. But
LINE 296: there still remains another vacancy, which, who would have thought it,
LINE 297: fat general Feng, of Yung Hsing, asked to purchase for his son; but I
LINE 298: have had no time to give him an answer. Besides, as our child wants to
LINE 299: purchase it, you had better at once write a statement of his
LINE 300: antecedents."
LINE 301: Chia Chen lost no time in bidding some one write the statement on red
LINE 302: paper, which Tai Ch'üan found, on perusal, to record that Chia Jung was
LINE 303: a graduate, by purchase, of the District of Chiang Ning, of the Ying
LINE 304: T'ien Prefecture, in Chiang Nan; that Chia Tai-hua, his great
LINE 305: grandfather, had been Commander-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Camp, and
LINE 306: an hereditary general of the first class, with the prefix of Spiritual
LINE 307: Majesty; that his grandfather Chia Ching was a metropolitan graduate of
LINE 308: the tripos in the Ping Ch'en year; and that his father Chia Chen had
LINE 309: inherited a rank of nobility of the third degree, and was a general,
LINE 310: with the prefix of Majestic Intrepidity.
LINE 311: Tai Ch'üan, after perusal, turned his hand behind him and passed (the
LINE 312: statement) to a constant attendant of his, to put away: "Go back," he
LINE 313: enjoined him, "and give it to His Excellency Mr. Chao, at the head of
LINE 314: the Board of Revenue, and tell him, that I present him my compliments,
LINE 315: and would like him to draw up a warrant for subaltern of the Imperial
LINE 316: Body Guard of the fifth grade, and to also issue a commission; that he
LINE 317: should take the particulars from this statement and fill them up; and
LINE 318: that to-morrow I'll come and have the money weighed and sent over."
LINE 319: The young attendant signified his obedience, and Tai Ch'üan thereupon
LINE 320: took his leave. Chia Chen did all he could to detain him, but with no
LINE 321: success; so that he had no alternative but to escort him as far as the
LINE 322: entrance of the Mansion. As he was about to mount into his chair, Chia
LINE 323: Chen inquired, "As regards the money, shall I go and pay it into the
LINE 324: Board, or am I to send it to the Board of Eunuchs?"
LINE 325: "If you were to go and pay it at the Board," observed Tai Ch'üan; "you
LINE 326: are sure to suffer loss; so that it would be better if you just weighed
LINE 327: exactly one thousand taels and sent them over to my place; for then an
LINE 328: end will be put to all trouble."
LINE 329: Chia Chen was incessant in his expression of gratitude. "When the period
LINE 330: of mourning has expired," he consequently added, "I shall lead in
LINE 331: person, my despicable eldest son to your mansion, to pay our obeisance,
LINE 332: and express our thanks."
LINE 333: They then parted company, but close upon this, were heard again the
LINE 334: voices of runners. It was, in fact, the spouse of Shih Ting, the marquis
LINE 335: of Chung Ching, who was just arriving. Shih Hsiang-yun, mesdames Wang,
LINE 336: and Hsing, lady Feng and the rest came out at once, to greet her, and
LINE 337: lead her into the Main Building; when they further saw the sacrificial
LINE 338: presents of the three families, of the marquis of Chin Hsiang, the
LINE 339: marquis of Ch'uan Ning, and the earl of Shou Shan, likewise spread out
LINE 340: in front of the tablet.
LINE 341: In a short while, these three noblemen descended from their chairs, and
LINE 342: Chia Chen received them in the Large Hall. In like manner all the
LINE 343: relatives and friends arrived in such quick succession, one coming,
LINE 344: another going, that it is impossible to remember even so much as their
LINE 345: number. One thing need be said that during these forty-nine days the
LINE 346: street on which the Ning Kuo mansion stood, was covered with a sheet of
LINE 347: white, formed by the people, coming and going; and thronged with
LINE 348: clusters of flowers, as the officials came and went.
LINE 349: At the instance of Chia Chen, Chia Jung, the next day donned his gala
LINE 350: dress and went over for his papers; and on his return the articles in
LINE 351: use in front of the coffin, as well as those belonging to the cortege
LINE 352: and other such things, were all regulated by the rules prescribed for an
LINE 353: official status of the fifth degree; while, on the tablet and notice
LINE 354: alike the inscription consisted of: Spirit of lady Ch'in, (by marriage)
LINE 355: of the Chia mansion, and by patent a lady of the fifth rank (of the
LINE 356: titles of honour).
LINE 357: The main entrance of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, adjoining the
LINE 358: street, was opened wide; and on both sides were raised sheds for the
LINE 359: musicians, and two companies of players, dressed in blue, discoursed
LINE 360: music at the proper times; while one pair after another of the
LINE 361: paraphernalia was drawn out so straight as if cut by a knife or slit by
LINE 362: an axe. There were also two large carmine boards, carved with gilt
LINE 363: inscriptions, erected outside the gate; the designations in bold
LINE 364: characters on the upper sides being: Guard of the Imperial Antechamber,
LINE 365: charged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads, in the Red
LINE 366: Prohibited City.
LINE 367: On the opposite side, facing each other, rose, high above the ground,
LINE 368: two altars for the services of the Buddhist and Taoist priests, while a
LINE 369: placard bore the inscription in bold type: Funeral Obsequies of lady
LINE 370: Ch'in, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, by patent a lady of the fifth
LINE 371: rank, consort of the eldest grandson of the hereditary duke of Ning Kuo,
LINE 372: and guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection of
LINE 373: the Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City. We, Wan Hsü, by
LINE 374: Heaven's commands charged with the perennial preservation of perfect
LINE 375: peace in the Kingdom of the Four Continents, as well as of the lands
LINE 376: contained therein, Head Controller of the School of Void and Asceticism,
LINE 377: and Superior in Chief (of the Buddhist hierarchy); and Yeh Sheng,
LINE 378: Principal Controller, since the creation, of the Disciples of Perfect
LINE 379: Excellence and Superior in Chief (of the Taoist priesthood), and others,
LINE 380: having in a reverent spirit purified ourselves by abstinence, now raise
LINE 381: our eyes up to Heaven, prostrate ourselves humbly before Buddha, and
LINE 382: devoutly pray all the Chia Lans, Chieh Tis, Kung Ts'aos and other
LINE 383: divinities to extend their sacred bounties, and from afar to display
LINE 384: their spiritual majesty, during the forty-nine days (of the funeral
LINE 385: rites), for the deliverance from judgment and the absolution from
LINE 386: retribution (of the spirit of lady Ch'in), so that it may enjoy a
LINE 387: peaceful and safe passage, whether by sea or by land; and other such
LINE 388: prayers to this effect, which are in fact not worth the trouble of
LINE 389: putting on record.
LINE 390: Chia Chen had, it is true, all his wishes gratified; but, as his wife
LINE 391: was laid up in the inner chambers, with a relapse of her old complaint,
LINE 392: and was not in a fit state to undertake the direction of the ceremonies,
LINE 393: he was very much distressed lest, when the high officials (and their
LINE 394: wives) came and went, there should occur any breach of the prescribed
LINE 395: conventionalities, which he was afraid would evoke ridicule. Hence it
LINE 396: was that he felt in low spirits; but while he was plunged in solicitude
LINE 397: Pao-yü, who happened to be close by, readily inquired, "Everything may
LINE 398: be safely looked upon as being satisfactorily settled, and why need you,
LINE 399: elder brother, still be so full of concern?"
LINE 400: Chia Chen forthwith explained to him how it was that in the ladies'
LINE 401: apartments there was no one (to do the honours), but Pao-yü at these
LINE 402: words smiled: "What difficulty is there about it?" he remarked; "I'll
LINE 403: recommend some one to take temporary charge of the direction of things
LINE 404: for you during the month, and I can guarantee that everything will be
LINE 405: properly carried out."
LINE 406: "Who is it?" Chia Chen was quick to ask; but as Pao-yü perceived that
LINE 407: there were still too many relatives and friends seated around, he did
LINE 408: not feel as if he could very well speak out; so that he went up to Chia
LINE 409: Chen and whispered a couple of remarks in his ear.
LINE 410: Chia Chen's joy knew no bounds when he heard this suggestion.
LINE 411: "Everything will indeed be properly carried out," he added laughingly;
LINE 412: "but I must now be going at once."
LINE 413: With these words, he drew Pao-yü along, and taking leave of the whole
LINE 414: number of visitors, they forthwith came into the drawing rooms.
LINE 415: This day was luckily not a grand occasion, so that few relatives and
LINE 416: friends had come. In the inner apartments there were only a small number
LINE 417: of ladies of close kinship. Mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng, and
LINE 418: the women of the whole household, were entertaining the guests, when
LINE 419: they heard a servant announce that Mr. Chia Chen had come. (This
LINE 420: announcement) took the whole body of ladies and young ladies so much by
LINE 421: surprise, that, with a rushing sound, they tried to hide in the back
LINE 422: rooms; but they were not quick enough (to effect their escape).
LINE 423: Lady Feng alone composedly stood up. Chia Chen was himself at this time
LINE 424: rather unwell, and being also very much cut up, he entered the room
LINE 425: shuffling along, propping himself up with a staff.
LINE 426: "You are not well?" therefore remarked madame Hsing and the others, "and
LINE 427: you've had besides so much to attend to during these consecutive days,
LINE 428: that what you require is rest to get all right; and why do you again
LINE 429: come over?"
LINE 430: Chia Chen was, as he leant on his staff, straining every nerve to bend
LINE 431: his body so as to fall on his knees and pay his respects to them, and
LINE 432: express his sense of obligation for the trouble they had taken, when
LINE 433: madame Hsing and the other ladies hastily called Pao-yü to raise him up,
LINE 434: bidding a servant move a chair for him to sit on. Chia Chen would not
LINE 435: take a seat; but making an effort to return a smile, "Your nephew," he
LINE 436: urged, "has come over, as there's a favour that I want to ask of my two
LINE 437: aunts as well as of my eldest cousin."
LINE 438: "What is it?" promptly inquired madame Hsing and the rest.
LINE 439: "My aunts," Chia Chen replied with all haste, "you surely are aware that
LINE 440: your grandson's wife is now no more; your nephew's wife is also laid up
LINE 441: unwell, and, as I see that things in the inner apartments are really not
LINE 442: what they should properly be, I would trouble my worthy eldest cousin to
LINE 443: undertake in here the direction of affairs for a month; and if she does,
LINE 444: my mind will be set at ease."
LINE 445: Madame Hsing smiled. "Is it really about this that you've come?" she
LINE 446: asked; "your eldest cousin is at present staying with your aunt Secunda,
LINE 447: and all you have to do is to speak to her and it will be all right."
LINE 448: "How ever could a mere child like her," speedily remonstrated madame
LINE 449: Wang, "carry out all these matters? and shouldn't she manage things
LINE 450: properly, she will, on the contrary, make people laugh, so it would
LINE 451: therefore be better that you should trouble some one else."
LINE 452: "What your ideas are, aunt," rejoined Chia Chen smiling, "your nephew
LINE 453: has guessed; you're afraid lest my eldest cousin should have to bear
LINE 454: fatigue and annoyance; for as to what you say, that she cannot manage
LINE 455: things, why my eldest cousin has, from her youth up, ever been in her
LINE 456: romping and playing so firm and decided; and now that she has entered
LINE 457: the married estate, and has the run of affairs in that mansion, she must
LINE 458: have reaped so much the more experience, and have become quite an old
LINE 459: hand! I've been thinking these last few days that outside my eldest
LINE 460: cousin, there's no one else who could come to my help; and, aunt, if you
LINE 461: don't do it for the face of your nephew and your nephew's wife, do it,
LINE 462: at least, for the affection you bore to her who is no more."
LINE 463: While he uttered these words tears trickled down his face. The fears
LINE 464: that madame Wang inwardly entertained were that lady Feng had no
LINE 465: experience in funeral matters, and she apprehended, that if she was not
LINE 466: equal to managing them, she would incur the ridicule of others; but when
LINE 467: she now heard Chia Chen make the appeal in such a disconsolate mood, she
LINE 468: relented considerably in her resolution. But as she turned her eyes
LINE 469: towards lady Feng (to ascertain her wishes), she saw that she was
LINE 470: plunged in abstraction.
LINE 471: Lady Feng had all along found the greatest zest in taking the initiative
LINE 472: in everything, with the idea of making a display of her abilities, so
LINE 473: that when she perceived how earnest Chia Chen was in his entreaties, she
LINE 474: had, at an early period, made up her mind to give a favourable reply.
LINE 475: Seeing besides madame Wang show signs of relenting, she readily turned
LINE 476: round and said to her, "My elder cousin has made his appeal in such a
LINE 477: solicitous way that your ladyship should give your consent and have done
LINE 478: with it."
LINE 479: "Do you think you are equal to the task?" inquired madame Wang in a
LINE 480: whisper.
LINE 481: "What's there that I couldn't be equal to?" replied lady Feng; "for
LINE 482: urgent matters outside, my cousin may be said to have already made full
LINE 483: provision; and all there is to be done is to keep an eye over things
LINE 484: inside. But should there occur anything that I don't know, I can ask
LINE 485: you, madame, and it will be right."
LINE 486: Madame Wang perceiving the reasonableness of what she heard her say,
LINE 487: uttered not a word, and when Chia Chen saw that lady Feng had assented;
LINE 488: "How much you do attend to I don't mind," he observed, forcing another
LINE 489: smile, "but I must, in any case, entreat you, cousin, to assume the
LINE 490: onerous charge. As a first step I'll pay my obeisance to you in here,
LINE 491: and when everything has been finished, I shall then come over into that
LINE 492: mansion to express my thanks."
LINE 493: With these words still on his lips, he made a low bow, but lady Feng had
LINE 494: scarcely had time to return the compliment, before Chia Chen had
LINE 495: directed a servant to fetch the warrant of the Ning mansion, which he
LINE 496: bade Pao-yü hand over to lady Feng.
LINE 497: "Cousin," he added, "take whatever steps you think best; and if you want
LINE 498: anything, all you have to do is to simply send for it with this, and
LINE 499: there will even be no use to consult me. The only thing I must ask you
LINE 500: is, not to be too careful in order to save me expense, for the main
LINE 501: consideration is that things should be handsomely done. In the second
LINE 502: place, it will be well if you were also to treat servants here in the
LINE 503: same way as in the other mansion, and not be too scrupulous in the fear
LINE 504: that any one might take offence. Outside these two concerns, there's
LINE 505: nothing else to disturb my mind."
LINE 506: Lady Feng did not venture to take over the warrant at once, but merely
LINE 507: turned round to ascertain what were madame Wang's wishes.
LINE 508: "In view of the reason brother Chen advances," madame Wang rejoined,
LINE 509: "you had better assume the charge at once and finish with it; don't,
LINE 510: however, act on your own ideas; but when there's aught to be done, be
LINE 511: careful and send some one to consult your cousin's wife, ever so little
LINE 512: though it be on the subject."
LINE 513: Pao-yü had already taken over the warrant from Chia Chen's grasp, and
LINE 514: forcibly handed it to lady Feng, "Will you, cousin," he went on to
LINE 515: question, "take up your quarters here or will you come every day? should
LINE 516: you cross over, day after day, it will be ever so much more fatiguing
LINE 517: for you, so that I shall speedily have a separate court got ready for
LINE 518: you in here, where you, cousin, can put up for these several days and be
LINE 519: more comfortable."
LINE 520: "There's no need," replied lady Feng smiling; "for on that side they
LINE 521: can't do without me; and it will be better if I were to come daily."
LINE 522: "Do as you like," Chia Chen observed; and after subsequently passing a
LINE 523: few more irrelevant remarks, he at length left the room.
LINE 524: After a time, the lady relatives dispersed, and madame Wang seized the
LINE 525: opportunity to inquire of lady Feng, "What do you purpose doing to-day?"
LINE 526: "You had better, please madame, go back," urged lady Feng, "for I must
LINE 527: first of all find out some clue before I can go home."
LINE 528: Madame Wang, upon hearing these words, returned to her quarters, in
LINE 529: advance, in company with madame Hsing, where we will leave them.
LINE 530: Lady Feng meanwhile came into a colonnade, which enclosed a suite of
LINE 531: three apartments, and taking a seat, she gave way to reflection. "The
LINE 532: first consideration," she communed within herself, "is that the
LINE 533: household is made up of mixed elements, and things might be lost; the
LINE 534: second is that the preparations are under no particular control, with
LINE 535: the result that, when the time comes, the servants might shirk their
LINE 536: duties; the third is that the necessary expenditure being great, there
LINE 537: will be reckless disbursements and counterfeit receipts; the fourth,
LINE 538: that with the absence of any distinction in the matter of duties,
LINE 539: whether large or small, hardship and ease will be unequally shared; and
LINE 540: the fifth, that the servants being arrogant, through leniency, those
LINE 541: with any self-respect will not brook control, while those devoid of
LINE 542: 'face' will not be able to improve their ways."
LINE 543: These five were, in point of fact, usages in vogue in the Ning mansion.
LINE 544: But as you are unable, reader, to ascertain here how lady Feng set
LINE 545: things right, listen to the explanations given in the following chapter.
