LINE 1: This is the opening section; this the first chapter. Subsequent to the
LINE 2: visions of a dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced,
LINE 3: the writer personally relates, he designedly concealed the true
LINE 4: circumstances, and borrowed the attributes of perception and
LINE 5: spirituality to relate this story of the Record of the Stone. With this
LINE 6: purpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin (truth under
LINE 7: the garb of fiction) and the like. What are, however, the events
LINE 8: recorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae?
LINE 9: Wearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the author
LINE 10: speaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success which
LINE 11: attended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of the
LINE 12: womankind of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, I
LINE 13: felt that in action and in lore, one and all were far above me; that in
LINE 14: spite of the majesty of my manliness, I could not, in point of fact,
LINE 15: compare with these characters of the gentle sex. And my shame forsooth
LINE 16: then knew no bounds; while regret, on the other hand, was of no avail,
LINE 17: as there was not even a remote possibility of a day of remedy.
LINE 18: On this very day it was that I became desirous to compile, in a
LINE 19: connected form, for publication throughout the world, with a view to
LINE 20: (universal) information, how that I bear inexorable and manifold
LINE 21: retribution; inasmuch as what time, by the sustenance of the benevolence
LINE 22: of Heaven, and the virtue of my ancestors, my apparel was rich and fine,
LINE 23: and as what days my fare was savory and sumptuous, I disregarded the
LINE 24: bounty of education and nurture of father and mother, and paid no heed
LINE 25: to the virtue of precept and injunction of teachers and friends, with
LINE 26: the result that I incurred the punishment, of failure recently in the
LINE 27: least trifle, and the reckless waste of half my lifetime. There have
LINE 28: been meanwhile, generation after generation, those in the inner
LINE 29: chambers, the whole mass of whom could not, on any account, be, through
LINE 30: my influence, allowed to fall into extinction, in order that I, unfilial
LINE 31: as I have been, may have the means to screen my own shortcomings.
LINE 32: Hence it is that the thatched shed, with bamboo mat windows, the bed of
LINE 33: tow and the stove of brick, which are at present my share, are not
LINE 34: sufficient to deter me from carrying out the fixed purpose of my mind.
LINE 35: And could I, furthermore, confront the morning breeze, the evening moon,
LINE 36: the willows by the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, methinks
LINE 37: these would moisten to a greater degree my mortal pen with ink; but
LINE 38: though I lack culture and erudition, what harm is there, however, in
LINE 39: employing fiction and unrecondite language to give utterance to the
LINE 40: merits of these characters? And were I also able to induce the inmates
LINE 41: of the inner chamber to understand and diffuse them, could I besides
LINE 42: break the weariness of even so much as a single moment, or could I open
LINE 43: the eyes of my contemporaries, will it not forsooth prove a boon?
LINE 44: This consideration has led to the usage of such names as Chia Yü-ts'un
LINE 45: and other similar appellations.
LINE 46: More than any in these pages have been employed such words as dreams and
LINE 47: visions; but these dreams constitute the main argument of this work, and
LINE 48: combine, furthermore, the design of giving a word of warning to my
LINE 49: readers.
LINE 50: Reader, can you suggest whence the story begins?
LINE 51: The narration may border on the limits of incoherency and triviality,
LINE 52: but it possesses considerable zest. But to begin.
LINE 53: The Empress Nü Wo, (the goddess of works,) in fashioning blocks of
LINE 54: stones, for the repair of the heavens, prepared, at the Ta Huang Hills
LINE 55: and Wu Ch'i cave, 36,501 blocks of rough stone, each twelve chang in
LINE 56: height, and twenty-four chang square. Of these stones, the Empress Wo
LINE 57: only used 36,500; so that one single block remained over and above,
LINE 58: without being turned to any account. This was cast down the Ch'ing Keng
LINE 59: peak. This stone, strange to say, after having undergone a process of
LINE 60: refinement, attained a nature of efficiency, and could, by its innate
LINE 61: powers, set itself into motion and was able to expand and to contract.
LINE 62: When it became aware that the whole number of blocks had been made use
LINE 63: of to repair the heavens, that it alone had been destitute of the
LINE 64: necessary properties and had been unfit to attain selection, it
LINE 65: forthwith felt within itself vexation and shame, and day and night, it
LINE 66: gave way to anguish and sorrow.
LINE 67: One day, while it lamented its lot, it suddenly caught sight, at a great
LINE 68: distance, of a Buddhist bonze and of a Taoist priest coming towards that
LINE 69: direction. Their appearance was uncommon, their easy manner remarkable.
LINE 70: When they drew near this Ch'ing Keng peak, they sat on the ground to
LINE 71: rest, and began to converse. But on noticing the block newly-polished
LINE 72: and brilliantly clear, which had moreover contracted in dimensions, and
LINE 73: become no larger than the pendant of a fan, they were greatly filled
LINE 74: with admiration. The Buddhist priest picked it up, and laid it in the
LINE 75: palm of his hand.
LINE 76: "Your appearance," he said laughingly, "may well declare you to be a
LINE 77: supernatural object, but as you lack any inherent quality it is
LINE 78: necessary to inscribe a few characters on you, so that every one who
LINE 79: shall see you may at once recognise you to be a remarkable thing. And
LINE 80: subsequently, when you will be taken into a country where honour and
LINE 81: affluence will reign, into a family cultured in mind and of official
LINE 82: status, in a land where flowers and trees shall flourish with
LINE 83: luxuriance, in a town of refinement, renown and glory; when you once
LINE 84: will have been there..."
LINE 85: The stone listened with intense delight.
LINE 86: "What characters may I ask," it consequently inquired, "will you
LINE 87: inscribe? and what place will I be taken to? pray, pray explain to me in
LINE 88: lucid terms." "You mustn't be inquisitive," the bonze replied, with a
LINE 89: smile, "in days to come you'll certainly understand everything." Having
LINE 90: concluded these words, he forthwith put the stone in his sleeve, and
LINE 91: proceeded leisurely on his journey, in company with the Taoist priest.
LINE 92: Whither, however, he took the stone, is not divulged. Nor can it be
LINE 93: known how many centuries and ages elapsed, before a Taoist priest, K'ung
LINE 94: K'ung by name, passed, during his researches after the eternal reason
LINE 95: and his quest after immortality, by these Ta Huang Hills, Wu Ch'i cave
LINE 96: and Ch'ing Keng Peak. Suddenly perceiving a large block of stone, on the
LINE 97: surface of which the traces of characters giving, in a connected form,
LINE 98: the various incidents of its fate, could be clearly deciphered, K'ung
LINE 99: K'ung examined them from first to last. They, in fact, explained how
LINE 100: that this block of worthless stone had originally been devoid of the
LINE 101: properties essential for the repairs to the heavens, how it would be
LINE 102: transmuted into human form and introduced by Mang Mang the High Lord,
LINE 103: and Miao Miao, the Divine, into the world of mortals, and how it would
LINE 104: be led over the other bank (across the San Sara). On the surface, the
LINE 105: record of the spot where it would fall, the place of its birth, as well
LINE 106: as various family trifles and trivial love affairs of young ladies,
LINE 107: verses, odes, speeches and enigmas was still complete; but the name of
LINE 108: the dynasty and the year of the reign were obliterated, and could not be
LINE 109: ascertained.
LINE 110: On the obverse, were also the following enigmatical verses:
LINE 111: Lacking in virtues meet the azure skies to mend,
LINE 112: In vain the mortal world full many a year I wend,
LINE 113: Of a former and after life these facts that be,
LINE 114: Who will for a tradition strange record for me?
LINE 115: K'ung K'ung, the Taoist, having pondered over these lines for a while,
LINE 116: became aware that this stone had a history of some kind.
LINE 117: "Brother stone," he forthwith said, addressing the stone, "the concerns
LINE 118: of past days recorded on you possess, according to your own account, a
LINE 119: considerable amount of interest, and have been for this reason
LINE 120: inscribed, with the intent of soliciting generations to hand them down
LINE 121: as remarkable occurrences. But in my own opinion, they lack, in the
LINE 122: first place, any data by means of which to establish the name of the
LINE 123: Emperor and the year of his reign; and, in the second place, these
LINE 124: constitute no record of any excellent policy, adopted by any high
LINE 125: worthies or high loyal statesmen, in the government of the state, or in
LINE 126: the rule of public morals. The contents simply treat of a certain number
LINE 127: of maidens, of exceptional character; either of their love affairs or
LINE 128: infatuations, or of their small deserts or insignificant talents; and
LINE 129: were I to transcribe the whole collection of them, they would,
LINE 130: nevertheless, not be estimated as a book of any exceptional worth."
LINE 131: "Sir Priest," the stone replied with assurance, "why are you so
LINE 132: excessively dull? The dynasties recorded in the rustic histories, which
LINE 133: have been written from age to age, have, I am fain to think, invariably
LINE 134: assumed, under false pretences, the mere nomenclature of the Han and
LINE 135: T'ang dynasties. They differ from the events inscribed on my block,
LINE 136: which do not borrow this customary practice, but, being based on my own
LINE 137: experiences and natural feelings, present, on the contrary, a novel and
LINE 138: unique character. Besides, in the pages of these rustic histories,
LINE 139: either the aspersions upon sovereigns and statesmen, or the strictures
LINE 140: upon individuals, their wives, and their daughters, or the deeds of
LINE 141: licentiousness and violence are too numerous to be computed. Indeed,
LINE 142: there is one more kind of loose literature, the wantonness and pollution
LINE 143: in which work most easy havoc upon youth.
LINE 144: "As regards the works, in which the characters of scholars and beauties
LINE 145: is delineated their allusions are again repeatedly of Wen Chün, their
LINE 146: theme in every page of Tzu Chien; a thousand volumes present no
LINE 147: diversity; and a thousand characters are but a counterpart of each
LINE 148: other. What is more, these works, throughout all their pages, cannot
LINE 149: help bordering on extreme licence. The authors, however, had no other
LINE 150: object in view than to give utterance to a few sentimental odes and
LINE 151: elegant ballads of their own, and for this reason they have fictitiously
LINE 152: invented the names and surnames of both men and women, and necessarily
LINE 153: introduced, in addition, some low characters, who should, like a buffoon
LINE 154: in a play, create some excitement in the plot.
LINE 155: "Still more loathsome is a kind of pedantic and profligate literature,
LINE 156: perfectly devoid of all natural sentiment, full of self-contradictions;
LINE 157: and, in fact, the contrast to those maidens in my work, whom I have,
LINE 158: during half my lifetime, seen with my own eyes and heard with my own
LINE 159: ears. And though I will not presume to estimate them as superior to the
LINE 160: heroes and heroines in the works of former ages, yet the perusal of the
LINE 161: motives and issues of their experiences, may likewise afford matter
LINE 162: sufficient to banish dulness, and to break the spell of melancholy.
LINE 163: "As regards the several stanzas of doggerel verse, they may too evoke
LINE 164: such laughter as to compel the reader to blurt out the rice, and to
LINE 165: spurt out the wine.
LINE 166: "In these pages, the scenes depicting the anguish of separation, the
LINE 167: bliss of reunion, and the fortunes of prosperity and of adversity are
LINE 168: all, in every detail, true to human nature, and I have not taken upon
LINE 169: myself to make the slightest addition, or alteration, which might lead
LINE 170: to the perversion of the truth.
LINE 171: "My only object has been that men may, after a drinking bout, or after
LINE 172: they wake from sleep or when in need of relaxation from the pressure of
LINE 173: business, take up this light literature, and not only expunge the traces
LINE 174: of antiquated books, and obtain a new kind of distraction, but that they
LINE 175: may also lay by a long life as well as energy and strength; for it bears
LINE 176: no point of similarity to those works, whose designs are false, whose
LINE 177: course is immoral. Now, Sir Priest, what are your views on the subject?"
LINE 178: K'ung K'ung having pondered for a while over the words, to which he had
LINE 179: listened intently, re-perused, throughout, this record of the stone; and
LINE 180: finding that the general purport consisted of nought else than a
LINE 181: treatise on love, and likewise of an accurate transcription of facts,
LINE 182: without the least taint of profligacy injurious to the times, he
LINE 183: thereupon copied the contents, from beginning to end, to the intent of
LINE 184: charging the world to hand them down as a strange story.
LINE 185: Hence it was that K'ung K'ung, the Taoist, in consequence of his
LINE 186: perception, (in his state of) abstraction, of passion, the generation,
LINE 187: from this passion, of voluptuousness, the transmission of this
LINE 188: voluptuousness into passion, and the apprehension, by means of passion,
LINE 189: of its unreality, forthwith altered his name for that of "Ch'ing Tseng"
LINE 190: (the Voluptuous Bonze), and changed the title of "the Memoir of a Stone"
LINE 191: (Shih-t'ou-chi,) for that of "Ch'ing Tseng Lu," The Record of the
LINE 192: Voluptuous Bonze; while K'ung Mei-chi of Tung Lu gave it the name of
LINE 193: "Feng Yüeh Pao Chien," "The Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness." In later
LINE 194: years, owing to the devotion by Tsao Hsüeh-ch'in in the Tao Hung study,
LINE 195: of ten years to the perusal and revision of the work, the additions and
LINE 196: modifications effected by him five times, the affix of an index and the
LINE 197: division into periods and chapters, the book was again entitled "Chin
LINE 198: Ling Shih Erh Ch'ai," "The Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling." A stanza was
LINE 199: furthermore composed for the purpose. This then, and no other, is the
LINE 200: origin of the Record of the Stone. The poet says appositely:--
LINE 201: Pages full of silly litter,
LINE 202: Tears a handful sour and bitter;
LINE 203: All a fool the author hold,
LINE 204: But their zest who can unfold?
LINE 205: You have now understood the causes which brought about the Record of the
LINE 206: Stone, but as you are not, as yet, aware what characters are depicted,
LINE 207: and what circumstances are related on the surface of the block, reader,
LINE 208: please lend an ear to the narrative on the stone, which runs as
LINE 209: follows:--
LINE 210: In old days, the land in the South East lay low. In this South-East part
LINE 211: of the world, was situated a walled town, Ku Su by name. Within the
LINE 212: walls a locality, called the Ch'ang Men, was more than all others
LINE 213: throughout the mortal world, the centre, which held the second, if not
LINE 214: the first place for fashion and life. Beyond this Ch'ang Men was a
LINE 215: street called Shih-li-chieh (Ten _Li_ street); in this street a lane,
LINE 216: the Jen Ch'ing lane (Humanity and Purity); and in this lane stood an old
LINE 217: temple, which on account of its diminutive dimensions, was called, by
LINE 218: general consent, the Gourd temple. Next door to this temple lived the
LINE 219: family of a district official, Chen by surname, Fei by name, and
LINE 220: Shih-yin by style. His wife, née Feng, possessed a worthy and virtuous
LINE 221: disposition, and had a clear perception of moral propriety and good
LINE 222: conduct. This family, though not in actual possession of excessive
LINE 223: affluence and honours, was, nevertheless, in their district, conceded to
LINE 224: be a clan of well-to-do standing. As this Chen Shih-yin was of a
LINE 225: contented and unambitious frame of mind, and entertained no hankering
LINE 226: after any official distinction, but day after day of his life took
LINE 227: delight in gazing at flowers, planting bamboos, sipping his wine and
LINE 228: conning poetical works, he was in fact, in the indulgence of these
LINE 229: pursuits, as happy as a supernatural being.
LINE 230: One thing alone marred his happiness. He had lived over half a century
LINE 231: and had, as yet, no male offspring around his knees. He had one only
LINE 232: child, a daughter, whose infant name was Ying Lien. She was just three
LINE 233: years of age. On a long summer day, on which the heat had been intense,
LINE 234: Shih-yin sat leisurely in his library. Feeling his hand tired, he
LINE 235: dropped the book he held, leant his head on a teapoy, and fell asleep.
LINE 236: Of a sudden, while in this state of unconsciousness, it seemed as if he
LINE 237: had betaken himself on foot to some spot or other whither he could not
LINE 238: discriminate. Unexpectedly he espied, in the opposite direction, two
LINE 239: priests coming towards him: the one a Buddhist, the other a Taoist. As
LINE 240: they advanced they kept up the conversation in which they were engaged.
LINE 241: "Whither do you purpose taking the object you have brought away?" he
LINE 242: heard the Taoist inquire. To this question the Buddhist replied with a
LINE 243: smile: "Set your mind at ease," he said; "there's now in maturity a plot
LINE 244: of a general character involving mundane pleasures, which will presently
LINE 245: come to a denouement. The whole number of the votaries of voluptuousness
LINE 246: have, as yet, not been quickened or entered the world, and I mean to
LINE 247: avail myself of this occasion to introduce this object among their
LINE 248: number, so as to give it a chance to go through the span of human
LINE 249: existence." "The votaries of voluptuousness of these days will naturally
LINE 250: have again to endure the ills of life during their course through the
LINE 251: mortal world," the Taoist remarked; "but when, I wonder, will they
LINE 252: spring into existence? and in what place will they descend?"
LINE 253: "The account of these circumstances," the bonze ventured to reply, "is
LINE 254: enough to make you laugh! They amount to this: there existed in the
LINE 255: west, on the bank of the Ling (spiritual) river, by the side of the San
LINE 256: Sheng (thrice-born) stone, a blade of the Chiang Chu (purple pearl)
LINE 257: grass. At about the same time it was that the block of stone was,
LINE 258: consequent upon its rejection by the goddess of works, also left to
LINE 259: ramble and wander to its own gratification, and to roam about at
LINE 260: pleasure to every and any place. One day it came within the precincts of
LINE 261: the Ching Huan (Monitory Vision) Fairy; and this Fairy, cognizant of the
LINE 262: fact that this stone had a history, detained it, therefore, to reside at
LINE 263: the Ch'ih Hsia (purple clouds) palace, and apportioned to it the duties
LINE 264: of attendant on Shen Ying, a fairy of the Ch'ih Hsia palace.
LINE 265: "This stone would, however, often stroll along the banks of the Ling
LINE 266: river, and having at the sight of the blade of spiritual grass been
LINE 267: filled with admiration, it, day by day, moistened its roots with sweet
LINE 268: dew. This purple pearl grass, at the outset, tarried for months and
LINE 269: years; but being at a later period imbued with the essence and
LINE 270: luxuriance of heaven and earth, and having incessantly received the
LINE 271: moisture and nurture of the sweet dew, divested itself, in course of
LINE 272: time, of the form of a grass; assuming, in lieu, a human nature, which
LINE 273: gradually became perfected into the person of a girl.
LINE 274: "Every day she was wont to wander beyond the confines of the Li Hen
LINE 275: (divested animosities) heavens. When hungry she fed on the Pi Ch'ing
LINE 276: (hidden love) fruit--when thirsty she drank the Kuan ch'ou (discharged
LINE 277: sorrows,) water. Having, however, up to this time, not shewn her
LINE 278: gratitude for the virtue of nurture lavished upon her, the result was
LINE 279: but natural that she should resolve in her heart upon a constant and
LINE 280: incessant purpose to make suitable acknowledgment.
LINE 281: "I have been," she would often commune within herself, "the recipient of
LINE 282: the gracious bounty of rain and dew, but I possess no such water as was
LINE 283: lavished upon me to repay it! But should it ever descend into the world
LINE 284: in the form of a human being, I will also betake myself thither, along
LINE 285: with it; and if I can only have the means of making restitution to it,
LINE 286: with the tears of a whole lifetime, I may be able to make adequate
LINE 287: return."
LINE 288: "This resolution it is that will evolve the descent into the world of so
LINE 289: many pleasure-bound spirits of retribution and the experience of
LINE 290: fantastic destinies; and this crimson pearl blade will also be among the
LINE 291: number. The stone still lies in its original place, and why should not
LINE 292: you and I take it along before the tribunal of the Monitory Vision
LINE 293: Fairy, and place on its behalf its name on record, so that it should
LINE 294: descend into the world, in company with these spirits of passion, and
LINE 295: bring this plot to an issue?"
LINE 296: "It is indeed ridiculous," interposed the Taoist. "Never before have I
LINE 297: heard even the very mention of restitution by means of tears! Why should
LINE 298: not you and I avail ourselves of this opportunity to likewise go down
LINE 299: into the world? and if successful in effecting the salvation of a few of
LINE 300: them, will it not be a work meritorious and virtuous?"
LINE 301: "This proposal," remarked the Buddhist, "is quite in harmony with my own
LINE 302: views. Come along then with me to the palace of the Monitory Vision
LINE 303: Fairy, and let us deliver up this good-for-nothing object, and have done
LINE 304: with it! And when the company of pleasure-bound spirits of wrath descend
LINE 305: into human existence, you and I can then enter the world. Half of them
LINE 306: have already fallen into the dusty universe, but the whole number of
LINE 307: them have not, as yet, come together."
LINE 308: "Such being the case," the Taoist acquiesced, "I am ready to follow you,
LINE 309: whenever you please to go."
LINE 310: But to return to Chen Shih-yin. Having heard every one of these words
LINE 311: distinctly, he could not refrain from forthwith stepping forward and
LINE 312: paying homage. "My spiritual lords," he said, as he smiled, "accept my
LINE 313: obeisance." The Buddhist and Taoist priests lost no time in responding
LINE 314: to the compliment, and they exchanged the usual salutations. "My
LINE 315: spiritual lords," Shih-yin continued; "I have just heard the
LINE 316: conversation that passed between you, on causes and effects, a
LINE 317: conversation the like of which few mortals have forsooth listened to;
LINE 318: but your younger brother is sluggish of intellect, and cannot lucidly
LINE 319: fathom the import! Yet could this dulness and simplicity be graciously
LINE 320: dispelled, your younger brother may, by listening minutely, with
LINE 321: undefiled ear and careful attention, to a certain degree be aroused to a
LINE 322: sense of understanding; and what is more, possibly find the means of
LINE 323: escaping the anguish of sinking down into Hades."
LINE 324: The two spirits smiled, "The conversation," they added, "refers to the
LINE 325: primordial scheme and cannot be divulged before the proper season; but,
LINE 326: when the time comes, mind do not forget us two, and you will readily be
LINE 327: able to escape from the fiery furnace."
LINE 328: Shih-yin, after this reply, felt it difficult to make any further
LINE 329: inquiries. "The primordial scheme," he however remarked smiling,
LINE 330: "cannot, of course, be divulged; but what manner of thing, I wonder, is
LINE 331: the good-for-nothing object you alluded to a short while back? May I not
LINE 332: be allowed to judge for myself?"
LINE 333: "This object about which you ask," the Buddhist Bonze responded, "is
LINE 334: intended, I may tell you, by fate to be just glanced at by you." With
LINE 335: these words he produced it, and handed it over to Shih-yin.
LINE 336: Shih-yin received it. On scrutiny he found it, in fact, to be a
LINE 337: beautiful gem, so lustrous and so clear that the traces of characters on
LINE 338: the surface were distinctly visible. The characters inscribed consisted
LINE 339: of the four "T'ung Ling Pao Yü," "Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception."
LINE 340: On the obverse, were also several columns of minute words, which he was
LINE 341: just in the act of looking at intently, when the Buddhist at once
LINE 342: expostulated.
LINE 343: "We have already reached," he exclaimed, "the confines of vision."
LINE 344: Snatching it violently out of his hands, he walked away with the Taoist,
LINE 345: under a lofty stone portal, on the face of which appeared in large type
LINE 346: the four characters: "T'ai Hsü Huan Ching," "The Visionary limits of the
LINE 347: Great Void." On each side was a scroll with the lines:
LINE 348: When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false,
LINE 349: Where naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught.
LINE 350: Shih-yin meant also to follow them on the other side, but, as he was
LINE 351: about to make one step forward, he suddenly heard a crash, just as if
LINE 352: the mountains had fallen into ruins, and the earth sunk into
LINE 353: destruction. As Shih-yin uttered a loud shout, he looked with strained
LINE 354: eye; but all he could see was the fiery sun shining, with glowing rays,
LINE 355: while the banana leaves drooped their heads. By that time, half of the
LINE 356: circumstances connected with the dream he had had, had already slipped
LINE 357: from his memory.
LINE 358: He also noticed a nurse coming towards him with Ying Lien in her arms.
LINE 359: To Shih-yin's eyes his daughter appeared even more beautiful, such a
LINE 360: bright gem, so precious, and so lovable. Forthwith stretching out his
LINE 361: arms, he took her over, and, as he held her in his embrace, he coaxed
LINE 362: her to play with him for a while; after which he brought her up to the
LINE 363: street to see the great stir occasioned by the procession that was going
LINE 364: past.
LINE 365: He was about to come in, when he caught sight of two priests, one a
LINE 366: Taoist, the other a Buddhist, coming hither from the opposite direction.
LINE 367: The Buddhist had a head covered with mange, and went barefooted. The
LINE 368: Taoist had a limping foot, and his hair was all dishevelled.
LINE 369: Like maniacs, they jostled along, chattering and laughing as they drew
LINE 370: near.
LINE 371: As soon as they reached Shih-yin's door, and they perceived him with
LINE 372: Ying Lien in his arms, the Bonze began to weep aloud.
LINE 373: Turning towards Shih-yin, he said to him: "My good Sir, why need you
LINE 374: carry in your embrace this living but luckless thing, which will involve
LINE 375: father and mother in trouble?"
LINE 376: These words did not escape Shih-yin's ear; but persuaded that they
LINE 377: amounted to raving talk, he paid no heed whatever to the bonze.
LINE 378: "Part with her and give her to me," the Buddhist still went on to say.
LINE 379: Shih-yin could not restrain his annoyance; and hastily pressing his
LINE 380: daughter closer to him, he was intent upon going in, when the bonze
LINE 381: pointed his hand at him, and burst out in a loud fit of laughter.
LINE 382: He then gave utterance to the four lines that follow:
LINE 383: You indulge your tender daughter and are laughed at as inane;
LINE 384: Vain you face the snow, oh mirror! for it will evanescent wane,
LINE 385: When the festival of lanterns is gone by, guard 'gainst your doom,
LINE 386: 'Tis what time the flames will kindle, and the fire will consume.
LINE 387: Shih-yin understood distinctly the full import of what he heard; but his
LINE 388: heart was still full of conjectures. He was about to inquire who and
LINE 389: what they were, when he heard the Taoist remark,--"You and I cannot
LINE 390: speed together; let us now part company, and each of us will be then
LINE 391: able to go after his own business. After the lapse of three ages, I
LINE 392: shall be at the Pei Mang mount, waiting for you; and we can, after our
LINE 393: reunion, betake ourselves to the Visionary Confines of the Great Void,
LINE 394: there to cancel the name of the stone from the records."
LINE 395: "Excellent! first rate!" exclaimed the Bonze. And at the conclusion of
LINE 396: these words, the two men parted, each going his own way, and no trace
LINE 397: was again seen of them.
LINE 398: "These two men," Shih-yin then pondered within his heart, "must have had
LINE 399: many experiences, and I ought really to have made more inquiries of
LINE 400: them; but at this juncture to indulge in regret is anyhow too late."
LINE 401: While Shih-yin gave way to these foolish reflections, he suddenly
LINE 402: noticed the arrival of a penniless scholar, Chia by surname, Hua by
LINE 403: name, Shih-fei by style and Yü-ts'un by nickname, who had taken up his
LINE 404: quarters in the Gourd temple next door. This Chia Yü-ts'un was
LINE 405: originally a denizen of Hu-Chow, and was also of literary and official
LINE 406: parentage, but as he was born of the youngest stock, and the possessions
LINE 407: of his paternal and maternal ancestors were completely exhausted, and
LINE 408: his parents and relatives were dead, he remained the sole and only
LINE 409: survivor; and, as he found his residence in his native place of no
LINE 410: avail, he therefore entered the capital in search of that reputation,
LINE 411: which would enable him to put the family estate on a proper standing. He
LINE 412: had arrived at this place since the year before last, and had, what is
LINE 413: more, lived all along in very straitened circumstances. He had made the
LINE 414: temple his temporary quarters, and earned a living by daily occupying
LINE 415: himself in composing documents and writing letters for customers. Thus
LINE 416: it was that Shih-yin had been in constant relations with him.
LINE 417: As soon as Yü-ts'un perceived Shih-yin, he lost no time in saluting him.
LINE 418: "My worthy Sir," he observed with a forced smile; "how is it you are
LINE 419: leaning against the door and looking out? Is there perchance any news
LINE 420: astir in the streets, or in the public places?"
LINE 421: "None whatever," replied Shih-yin, as he returned the smile. "Just a
LINE 422: while back, my young daughter was in sobs, and I coaxed her out here to
LINE 423: amuse her. I am just now without anything whatever to attend to, so
LINE 424: that, dear brother Chia, you come just in the nick of time. Please walk
LINE 425: into my mean abode, and let us endeavour, in each other's company, to
LINE 426: while away this long summer day."
LINE 427: After he had made this remark, he bade a servant take his daughter in,
LINE 428: while he, hand-in-hand with Yü-ts'un, walked into the library, where a
LINE 429: young page served tea. They had hardly exchanged a few sentences, when
LINE 430: one of the household came in, in flying haste, to announce that Mr. Yen
LINE 431: had come to pay a visit.
LINE 432: Shih-yin at once stood up. "Pray excuse my rudeness," he remarked
LINE 433: apologetically, "but do sit down; I shall shortly rejoin you, and enjoy
LINE 434: the pleasure of your society." "My dear Sir," answered Yü-ts'un, as he
LINE 435: got up, also in a conceding way, "suit your own convenience. I've often
LINE 436: had the honour of being your guest, and what will it matter if I wait a
LINE 437: little?" While these apologies were yet being spoken, Shih-yin had
LINE 438: already walked out into the front parlour. During his absence, Yü-ts'un
LINE 439: occupied himself in turning over the pages of some poetical work to
LINE 440: dispel ennui, when suddenly he heard, outside the window, a woman's
LINE 441: cough. Yü-ts'un hurriedly got up and looked out. He saw at a glance that
LINE 442: it was a servant girl engaged in picking flowers. Her deportment was out
LINE 443: of the common; her eyes so bright, her eyebrows so well defined. Though
LINE 444: not a perfect beauty, she possessed nevertheless charms sufficient to
LINE 445: arouse the feelings. Yü-ts'un unwittingly gazed at her with fixed eye.
LINE 446: This waiting-maid, belonging to the Chen family, had done picking
LINE 447: flowers, and was on the point of going in, when she of a sudden raised
LINE 448: her eyes and became aware of the presence of some person inside the
LINE 449: window, whose head-gear consisted of a turban in tatters, while his
LINE 450: clothes were the worse for wear. But in spite of his poverty, he was
LINE 451: naturally endowed with a round waist, a broad back, a fat face, a square
LINE 452: mouth; added to this, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes resembled
LINE 453: stars, his nose was straight, his cheeks square.
LINE 454: This servant girl turned away in a hurry and made her escape.
LINE 455: "This man so burly and strong," she communed within herself, "yet at the
LINE 456: same time got up in such poor attire, must, I expect, be no one else
LINE 457: than the man, whose name is Chia Yü-ts'un or such like, time after time
LINE 458: referred to by my master, and to whom he has repeatedly wished to give a
LINE 459: helping hand, but has failed to find a favourable opportunity. And as
LINE 460: related to our family there is no connexion or friend in such straits, I
LINE 461: feel certain it cannot be any other person than he. Strange to say, my
LINE 462: master has further remarked that this man will, for a certainty, not
LINE 463: always continue in such a state of destitution."
LINE 464: As she indulged in this train of thought, she could not restrain herself
LINE 465: from turning her head round once or twice.
LINE 466: When Yü-ts'un perceived that she had looked back, he readily interpreted
LINE 467: it as a sign that in her heart her thoughts had been of him, and he was
LINE 468: frantic with irrepressible joy.
LINE 469: "This girl," he mused, "is, no doubt, keen-eyed and eminently shrewd,
LINE 470: and one in this world who has seen through me."
LINE 471: The servant youth, after a short time, came into the room; and when
LINE 472: Yü-ts'un made inquiries and found out from him that the guests in the
LINE 473: front parlour had been detained to dinner, he could not very well wait
LINE 474: any longer, and promptly walked away down a side passage and out of a
LINE 475: back door.
LINE 476: When the guests had taken their leave, Shih-yin did not go back to
LINE 477: rejoin Yü-ts'un, as he had come to know that he had already left.
LINE 478: In time the mid-autumn festivities drew near; and Shih-yin, after the
LINE 479: family banquet was over, had a separate table laid in the library, and
LINE 480: crossed over, in the moonlight, as far as the temple and invited
LINE 481: Yü-ts'un to come round.
LINE 482: The fact is that Yü-ts'un, ever since the day on which he had seen the
LINE 483: girl of the Chen family turn twice round to glance at him, flattered
LINE 484: himself that she was friendly disposed towards him, and incessantly
LINE 485: fostered fond thoughts of her in his heart. And on this day, which
LINE 486: happened to be the mid-autumn feast, he could not, as he gazed at the
LINE 487: moon, refrain from cherishing her remembrance. Hence it was that he gave
LINE 488: vent to these pentameter verses:
LINE 489: Alas! not yet divined my lifelong wish,
LINE 490: And anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish
LINE 491: I came, and sad at heart, my brow I frowned;
LINE 492: She went, and oft her head to look turned round.
LINE 493: Facing the breeze, her shadow she doth watch,
LINE 494: Who's meet this moonlight night with her to match?
LINE 495: The lustrous rays if they my wish but read
LINE 496: Would soon alight upon her beauteous head!
LINE 497: Yü-ts'un having, after this recitation, recalled again to mind how that
LINE 498: throughout his lifetime his literary attainments had had an adverse fate
LINE 499: and not met with an opportunity (of reaping distinction), went on to rub
LINE 500: his brow, and as he raised his eyes to the skies, he heaved a deep sigh
LINE 501: and once more intoned a couplet aloud:
LINE 502: The gem in the cask a high price it seeks,
LINE 503: The pin in the case to take wing it waits.
LINE 504: As luck would have it, Shih-yin was at the moment approaching, and upon
LINE 505: hearing the lines, he said with a smile: "My dear Yü-ts'un, really your
LINE 506: attainments are of no ordinary capacity."
LINE 507: Yü-ts'un lost no time in smiling and replying. "It would be presumption
LINE 508: in my part to think so," he observed. "I was simply at random humming a
LINE 509: few verses composed by former writers, and what reason is there to laud
LINE 510: me to such an excessive degree? To what, my dear Sir, do I owe the
LINE 511: pleasure of your visit?" he went on to inquire. "Tonight," replied
LINE 512: Shih-yin, "is the mid-autumn feast, generally known as the full-moon
LINE 513: festival; and as I could not help thinking that living, as you my worthy
LINE 514: brother are, as a mere stranger in this Buddhist temple, you could not
LINE 515: but experience the feeling of loneliness. I have, for the express
LINE 516: purpose, prepared a small entertainment, and will be pleased if you will
LINE 517: come to my mean abode to have a glass of wine. But I wonder whether you
LINE 518: will entertain favourably my modest invitation?" Yü-ts'un, after
LINE 519: listening to the proposal, put forward no refusal of any sort; but
LINE 520: remarked complacently: "Being the recipient of such marked attention,
LINE 521: how can I presume to repel your generous consideration?"
LINE 522: As he gave expression to these words, he walked off there and then, in
LINE 523: company with Shih-yin, and came over once again into the court in front
LINE 524: of the library. In a few minutes, tea was over.
LINE 525: The cups and dishes had been laid from an early hour, and needless to
LINE 526: say the wines were luscious; the fare sumptuous.
LINE 527: The two friends took their seats. At first they leisurely replenished
LINE 528: their glasses, and quietly sipped their wine; but as, little by little,
LINE 529: they entered into conversation, their good cheer grew more genial, and
LINE 530: unawares the glasses began to fly round, and the cups to be exchanged.
LINE 531: At this very hour, in every house of the neighbourhood, sounded the fife
LINE 532: and lute, while the inmates indulged in music and singing. Above head,
LINE 533: the orb of the radiant moon shone with an all-pervading splendour, and
LINE 534: with a steady lustrous light, while the two friends, as their exuberance
LINE 535: increased, drained their cups dry so soon as they reached their lips.
LINE 536: Yü-ts'un, at this stage of the collation, was considerably under the
LINE 537: influence of wine, and the vehemence of his high spirits was
LINE 538: irrepressible. As he gazed at the moon, he fostered thoughts, to which
LINE 539: he gave vent by the recital of a double couplet.
LINE 540: 'Tis what time three meets five, Selene is a globe!
LINE 541: Her pure rays fill the court, the jadelike rails enrobe!
LINE 542: Lo! in the heavens her disk to view doth now arise,
LINE 543: And in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.
LINE 544: "Excellent!" cried Shih-yin with a loud voice, after he had heard these
LINE 545: lines; "I have repeatedly maintained that it was impossible for you to
LINE 546: remain long inferior to any, and now the verses you have recited are a
LINE 547: prognostic of your rapid advancement. Already it is evident that, before
LINE 548: long, you will extend your footsteps far above the clouds! I must
LINE 549: congratulate you! I must congratulate you! Let me, with my own hands,
LINE 550: pour a glass of wine to pay you my compliments."
LINE 551: Yü-ts'un drained the cup. "What I am about to say," he explained as he
LINE 552: suddenly heaved a sigh, "is not the maudlin talk of a man under the
LINE 553: effects of wine. As far as the subjects at present set in the
LINE 554: examinations go, I could, perchance, also have well been able to enter
LINE 555: the list, and to send in my name as a candidate; but I have, just now,
LINE 556: no means whatever to make provision for luggage and for travelling
LINE 557: expenses. The distance too to Shen Ching is a long one, and I could not
LINE 558: depend upon the sale of papers or the composition of essays to find the
LINE 559: means of getting there."
LINE 560: Shih-yin gave him no time to conclude. "Why did you not speak about this
LINE 561: sooner?" he interposed with haste. "I have long entertained this
LINE 562: suspicion; but as, whenever I met you, this conversation was never
LINE 563: broached, I did not presume to make myself officious. But if such be the
LINE 564: state of affairs just now, I lack, I admit, literary qualification, but
LINE 565: on the two subjects of friendly spirit and pecuniary means, I have,
LINE 566: nevertheless, some experience. Moreover, I rejoice that next year is
LINE 567: just the season for the triennial examinations, and you should start for
LINE 568: the capital with all despatch; and in the tripos next spring, you will,
LINE 569: by carrying the prize, be able to do justice to the proficiency you can
LINE 570: boast of. As regards the travelling expenses and the other items, the
LINE 571: provision of everything necessary for you by my own self will again not
LINE 572: render nugatory your mean acquaintance with me."
LINE 573: Forthwith, he directed a servant lad to go and pack up at once fifty
LINE 574: taels of pure silver and two suits of winter clothes.
LINE 575: "The nineteenth," he continued, "is a propitious day, and you should
LINE 576: lose no time in hiring a boat and starting on your journey westwards.
LINE 577: And when, by your eminent talents, you shall have soared high to a lofty
LINE 578: position, and we meet again next winter, will not the occasion be
LINE 579: extremely felicitous?"
LINE 580: Yü-ts'un accepted the money and clothes with but scanty expression of
LINE 581: gratitude. In fact, he paid no thought whatever to the gifts, but went
LINE 582: on, again drinking his wine, as he chattered and laughed.
LINE 583: It was only when the third watch of that day had already struck that the
LINE 584: two friends parted company; and Shih-yin, after seeing Yü-ts'un off,
LINE 585: retired to his room and slept, with one sleep all through, never waking
LINE 586: until the sun was well up in the skies.
LINE 587: Remembering the occurrence of the previous night, he meant to write a
LINE 588: couple of letters of recommendation for Yü-ts'un to take along with him
LINE 589: to the capital, to enable him, after handing them over at the mansions
LINE 590: of certain officials, to find some place as a temporary home. He
LINE 591: accordingly despatched a servant to ask him to come round, but the man
LINE 592: returned and reported that from what the bonze said, "Mr. Chia had
LINE 593: started on his journey to the capital, at the fifth watch of that very
LINE 594: morning, that he had also left a message with the bonze to deliver to
LINE 595: you, Sir, to the effect that men of letters paid no heed to lucky or
LINE 596: unlucky days, that the sole consideration with them was the nature of
LINE 597: the matter in hand, and that he could find no time to come round in
LINE 598: person and bid good-bye."
LINE 599: Shih-yin after hearing this message had no alternative but to banish the
LINE 600: subject from his thoughts.
LINE 601: In comfortable circumstances, time indeed goes by with easy stride. Soon
LINE 602: drew near also the happy festival of the 15th of the 1st moon, and
LINE 603: Shih-yin told a servant Huo Ch'i to take Ying Lien to see the
LINE 604: sacrificial fires and flowery lanterns.
LINE 605: About the middle of the night, Huo Ch'i was hard pressed, and he
LINE 606: forthwith set Ying Lien down on the doorstep of a certain house. When he
LINE 607: felt relieved, he came back to take her up, but failed to find anywhere
LINE 608: any trace of Ying Lien. In a terrible plight, Huo Ch'i prosecuted his
LINE 609: search throughout half the night; but even by the dawn of day, he had
LINE 610: not discovered any clue of her whereabouts. Huo Ch'i, lacking, on the
LINE 611: other hand, the courage to go back and face his master, promptly made
LINE 612: his escape to his native village.
LINE 613: Shih-yin--in fact, the husband as well as the wife--seeing that their
LINE 614: child had not come home during the whole night, readily concluded that
LINE 615: some mishap must have befallen her. Hastily they despatched several
LINE 616: servants to go in search of her, but one and all returned to report that
LINE 617: there was neither vestige nor tidings of her.
LINE 618: This couple had only had this child, and this at the meridian of their
LINE 619: life, so that her sudden disappearance plunged them in such great
LINE 620: distress that day and night they mourned her loss to such a point as to
LINE 621: well nigh pay no heed to their very lives.
LINE 622: A month in no time went by. Shih-yin was the first to fall ill, and his
LINE 623: wife, Dame Feng, likewise, by dint of fretting for her daughter, was
LINE 624: also prostrated with sickness. The doctor was, day after day, sent for,
LINE 625: and the oracle consulted by means of divination.
LINE 626: Little did any one think that on this day, being the 15th of the 3rd
LINE 627: moon, while the sacrificial oblations were being prepared in the Hu Lu
LINE 628: temple, a pan with oil would have caught fire, through the want of care
LINE 629: on the part of the bonze, and that in a short time the flames would have
LINE 630: consumed the paper pasted on the windows.
LINE 631: Among the natives of this district bamboo fences and wooden partitions
LINE 632: were in general use, and these too proved a source of calamity so
LINE 633: ordained by fate (to consummate this decree).
LINE 634: With promptness (the fire) extended to two buildings, then enveloped
LINE 635: three, then dragged four (into ruin), and then spread to five houses,
LINE 636: until the whole street was in a blaze, resembling the flames of a
LINE 637: volcano. Though both the military and the people at once ran to the
LINE 638: rescue, the fire had already assumed a serious hold, so that it was
LINE 639: impossible for them to afford any effective assistance for its
LINE 640: suppression.
LINE 641: It blazed away straight through the night, before it was extinguished,
LINE 642: and consumed, there is in fact no saying how many dwelling houses.
LINE 643: Anyhow, pitiful to relate, the Chen house, situated as it was next door
LINE 644: to the temple, was, at an early part of the evening, reduced to a heap
LINE 645: of tiles and bricks; and nothing but the lives of that couple and
LINE 646: several inmates of the family did not sustain any injuries.
LINE 647: Shih-yin was in despair, but all he could do was to stamp his feet and
LINE 648: heave deep sighs. After consulting with his wife, they betook themselves
LINE 649: to a farm of theirs, where they took up their quarters temporarily. But
LINE 650: as it happened that water had of late years been scarce, and no crops
LINE 651: been reaped, robbers and thieves had sprung up like bees, and though the
LINE 652: Government troops were bent upon their capture, it was anyhow difficult
LINE 653: to settle down quietly on the farm. He therefore had no other resource
LINE 654: than to convert, at a loss, the whole of his property into money, and to
LINE 655: take his wife and two servant girls and come over for shelter to the
LINE 656: house of his father-in-law.
LINE 657: His father-in-law, Feng Su, by name, was a native of Ta Ju Chou.
LINE 658: Although only a labourer, he was nevertheless in easy circumstances at
LINE 659: home. When he on this occasion saw his son-in-law come to him in such
LINE 660: distress, he forthwith felt at heart considerable displeasure.
LINE 661: Fortunately Shih-yin had still in his possession the money derived from
LINE 662: the unprofitable realization of his property, so that he produced and
LINE 663: handed it to his father-in-law, commissioning him to purchase, whenever
LINE 664: a suitable opportunity presented itself, a house and land as a provision
LINE 665: for food and raiment against days to come. This Feng Su, however, only
LINE 666: expended the half of the sum, and pocketed the other half, merely
LINE 667: acquiring for him some fallow land and a dilapidated house.
LINE 668: Shih-yin being, on the other hand, a man of books and with no experience
LINE 669: in matters connected with business and with sowing and reaping,
LINE 670: subsisted, by hook and by crook, for about a year or two, when he became
LINE 671: more impoverished.
LINE 672: In his presence, Feng Su would readily give vent to specious utterances,
LINE 673: while, with others, and behind his back, he on the contrary expressed
LINE 674: his indignation against his improvidence in his mode of living, and
LINE 675: against his sole delight of eating and playing the lazy.
LINE 676: Shih-yin, aware of the want of harmony with his father-in-law, could not
LINE 677: help giving way, in his own heart, to feelings of regret and pain. In
LINE 678: addition to this, the fright and vexation which he had undergone the
LINE 679: year before, the anguish and suffering (he had had to endure), had
LINE 680: already worked havoc (on his constitution); and being a man advanced in
LINE 681: years, and assailed by the joint attack of poverty and disease, he at
LINE 682: length gradually began to display symptoms of decline.
LINE 683: Strange coincidence, as he, on this day, came leaning on his staff and
LINE 684: with considerable strain, as far as the street for a little relaxation,
LINE 685: he suddenly caught sight, approaching from the off side, of a Taoist
LINE 686: priest with a crippled foot; his maniac appearance so repulsive, his
LINE 687: shoes of straw, his dress all in tatters, muttering several sentiments
LINE 688: to this effect:
LINE 689: All men spiritual life know to be good,
LINE 690: But fame to disregard they ne'er succeed!
LINE 691: From old till now the statesmen where are they?
LINE 692: Waste lie their graves, a heap of grass, extinct.
LINE 693: All men spiritual life know to be good,
LINE 694: But to forget gold, silver, ill succeed!
LINE 695: Through life they grudge their hoardings to be scant,
LINE 696: And when plenty has come, their eyelids close.
LINE 697: All men spiritual life hold to be good,
LINE 698: Yet to forget wives, maids, they ne'er succeed!
LINE 699: Who speak of grateful love while lives their lord,
LINE 700: And dead their lord, another they pursue.
LINE 701: All men spiritual life know to be good,
LINE 702: But sons and grandsons to forget never succeed!
LINE 703: From old till now of parents soft many,
LINE 704: But filial sons and grandsons who have seen?
LINE 705: Shih-yin upon hearing these words, hastily came up to the priest, "What
LINE 706: were you so glibly holding forth?" he inquired. "All I could hear were a
LINE 707: lot of hao liao (excellent, finality.")
LINE 708: "You may well have heard the two words 'hao liao,'" answered the Taoist
LINE 709: with a smile, "but can you be said to have fathomed their meaning? You
LINE 710: should know that all things in this world are excellent, when they have
LINE 711: attained finality; when they have attained finality, they are excellent;
LINE 712: but when they have not attained finality, they are not excellent; if
LINE 713: they would be excellent, they should attain finality. My song is
LINE 714: entitled Excellent-finality (hao liao)."
LINE 715: Shih-yin was gifted with a natural perspicacity that enabled him, as
LINE 716: soon as he heard these remarks, to grasp their spirit.
LINE 717: "Wait a while," he therefore said smilingly; "let me unravel this
LINE 718: excellent-finality song of yours; do you mind?"
LINE 719: "Please by all means go on with the interpretation," urged the Taoist;
LINE 720: whereupon Shih-yin proceeded in this strain:
LINE 721: Sordid rooms and vacant courts,
LINE 722: Replete in years gone by with beds where statesmen lay;
LINE 723: Parched grass and withered banian trees,
LINE 724: Where once were halls for song and dance!
LINE 725: Spiders' webs the carved pillars intertwine,
LINE 726: The green gauze now is also pasted on the straw windows!
LINE 727: What about the cosmetic fresh concocted or the powder just scented;
LINE 728: Why has the hair too on each temple become white like hoarfrost!
LINE 729: Yesterday the tumulus of yellow earth buried the bleached bones,
LINE 730: To-night under the red silk curtain reclines the couple!
LINE 731: Gold fills the coffers, silver fills the boxes,
LINE 732: But in a twinkle, the beggars will all abuse you!
LINE 733: While you deplore that the life of others is not long,
LINE 734: You forget that you yourself are approaching death!
LINE 735: You educate your sons with all propriety,
LINE 736: But they may some day, 'tis hard to say become thieves;
LINE 737: Though you choose (your fare and home) the fatted beam,
LINE 738: You may, who can say, fall into some place of easy virtue!
LINE 739: Through your dislike of the gauze hat as mean,
LINE 740: You have come to be locked in a cangue;
LINE 741: Yesterday, poor fellow, you felt cold in a tattered coat,
LINE 742: To-day, you despise the purple embroidered dress as long!
LINE 743: Confusion reigns far and wide! you have just sung your part, I come on
LINE 744: the boards,
LINE 745: Instead of yours, you recognise another as your native land;
LINE 746: What utter perversion!
LINE 747: In one word, it comes to this we make wedding clothes for others!
LINE 748: (We sow for others to reap.)
LINE 749: The crazy limping Taoist clapped his hands. "Your interpretation is
LINE 750: explicit," he remarked with a hearty laugh, "your interpretation is
LINE 751: explicit!"
LINE 752: Shih-yin promptly said nothing more than,--"Walk on;" and seizing the
LINE 753: stole from the Taoist's shoulder, he flung it over his own. He did not,
LINE 754: however, return home, but leisurely walked away, in company with the
LINE 755: eccentric priest.
LINE 756: The report of his disappearance was at once bruited abroad, and plunged
LINE 757: the whole neighbourhood in commotion; and converted into a piece of
LINE 758: news, it was circulated from mouth to mouth.
LINE 759: Dame Feng, Shih-yin's wife, upon hearing the tidings, had such a fit of
LINE 760: weeping that she hung between life and death; but her only alternative
LINE 761: was to consult with her father, and to despatch servants on all sides to
LINE 762: institute inquiries. No news was however received of him, and she had
LINE 763: nothing else to do but to practise resignation, and to remain dependent
LINE 764: upon the support of her parents for her subsistence. She had fortunately
LINE 765: still by her side, to wait upon her, two servant girls, who had been
LINE 766: with her in days gone by; and the three of them, mistress as well as
LINE 767: servants, occupied themselves day and night with needlework, to assist
LINE 768: her father in his daily expenses.
LINE 769: This Feng Su had after all, in spite of his daily murmurings against his
LINE 770: bad luck, no help but to submit to the inevitable.
LINE 771: On a certain day, the elder servant girl of the Chen family was at the
LINE 772: door purchasing thread, and while there, she of a sudden heard in the
LINE 773: street shouts of runners clearing the way, and every one explain that
LINE 774: the new magistrate had come to take up his office.
LINE 775: The girl, as she peeped out from inside the door, perceived the lictors
LINE 776: and policemen go by two by two; and when unexpectedly in a state chair,
LINE 777: was carried past an official, in black hat and red coat, she was indeed
LINE 778: quite taken aback.
LINE 779: "The face of this officer would seem familiar," she argued within
LINE 780: herself; "just as if I had seen him somewhere or other ere this."
LINE 781: Shortly she entered the house, and banishing at once the occurrence from
LINE 782: her mind, she did not give it a second thought. At night, however, while
LINE 783: she was waiting to go to bed, she suddenly heard a sound like a rap at
LINE 784: the door. A band of men boisterously cried out: "We are messengers,
LINE 785: deputed by the worthy magistrate of this district, and come to summon
LINE 786: one of you to an enquiry."
LINE 787: Feng Su, upon hearing these words, fell into such a terrible
LINE 788: consternation that his eyes stared wide and his mouth gaped.
LINE 789: What calamity was impending is not as yet ascertained, but, reader,
LINE 790: listen to the explanation contained in the next chapter.
