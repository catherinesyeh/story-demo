LINE 1: The spirit of Mrs. Chia Shih-yin departs from the town of Yang Chou.
LINE 2: Leng Tzu-hsing dilates upon the Jung Kuo Mansion.
LINE 3: To continue. Feng Su, upon hearing the shouts of the public messengers,
LINE 4: came out in a flurry and forcing a smile, he asked them to explain
LINE 5: (their errand); but all these people did was to continue bawling out:
LINE 6: "Be quick, and ask Mr. Chen to come out."
LINE 7: "My surname is Feng," said Feng Su, as he promptly forced himself to
LINE 8: smile; "It is'nt Chen at all: I had once a son-in-law whose surname was
LINE 9: Chen, but he has left home, it is now already a year or two back. Is it
LINE 10: perchance about him that you are inquiring?"
LINE 11: To which the public servants remarked: "We know nothing about Chen or
LINE 12: Chia (true or false); but as he is your son-in-law, we'll take you at
LINE 13: once along with us to make verbal answer to our master and have done
LINE 14: with it."
LINE 15: And forthwith the whole bevy of public servants hustled Feng Su on, as
LINE 16: they went on their way back; while every one in the Feng family was
LINE 17: seized with consternation, and could not imagine what it was all about.
LINE 18: It was no earlier than the second watch, when Feng Su returned home; and
LINE 19: they, one and all, pressed him with questions as to what had happened.
LINE 20: "The fact is," he explained, "the newly-appointed Magistrate, whose
LINE 21: surname is Chia, whose name is Huo and who is a native of Hu-chow, has
LINE 22: been on intimate terms, in years gone by, with our son-in-law; that at
LINE 23: the sight of the girl Chiao Hsing, standing at the door, in the act of
LINE 24: buying thread, he concluded that he must have shifted his quarters over
LINE 25: here, and hence it was that his messengers came to fetch him. I gave him
LINE 26: a clear account of the various circumstances (of his misfortunes), and
LINE 27: the Magistrate was for a time much distressed and expressed his regret.
LINE 28: He then went on to make inquiries about my grand-daughter, and I
LINE 29: explained that she had been lost, while looking at the illuminations.
LINE 30: 'No matter,' put in the Magistrate, 'I will by and by order my men to
LINE 31: make search, and I feel certain that they will find her and bring her
LINE 32: back.' Then ensued a short conversation, after which I was about to go,
LINE 33: when he presented me with the sum of two taels."
LINE 34: The mistress of the Chen family (Mrs. Chen Shih-yin) could not but feel
LINE 35: very much affected by what she heard, and the whole evening she uttered
LINE 36: not a word.
LINE 37: The next day, at an early hour, Yü-ts'un sent some of his men to bring
LINE 38: over to Chen's wife presents, consisting of two packets of silver, and
LINE 39: four pieces of brocaded silk, as a token of gratitude, and to Feng Su
LINE 40: also a confidential letter, requesting him to ask of Mrs. Chen her maid
LINE 41: Chiao Hsing to become his second wife.
LINE 42: Feng Su was so intensely delighted that his eyebrows expanded, his eyes
LINE 43: smiled, and he felt eager to toady to the Magistrate (by presenting the
LINE 44: girl to him). He hastened to employ all his persuasive powers with his
LINE 45: daughter (to further his purpose), and on the same evening he forthwith
LINE 46: escorted Chiao Hsing in a small chair to the Yamên.
LINE 47: The joy experienced by Yü-ts'un need not be dilated upon. He also
LINE 48: presented Feng Su with a packet containing one hundred ounces of gold;
LINE 49: and sent numerous valuable presents to Mrs. Chen, enjoining her "to live
LINE 50: cheerfully in the anticipation of finding out the whereabouts of her
LINE 51: daughter."
LINE 52: It must be explained, however, that the maid Chi'ao Hsing was the very
LINE 53: person, who, a few years ago, had looked round at Yü-ts'un and who, by
LINE 54: one simple, unpremeditated glance, evolved, in fact, this extraordinary
LINE 55: destiny which was indeed an event beyond conception.
LINE 56: Who would ever have foreseen that fate and fortune would both have so
LINE 57: favoured her that she should, contrary to all anticipation, give birth
LINE 58: to a son, after living with Yü-ts'un barely a year, that in addition to
LINE 59: this, after the lapse of another half year, Yü-ts'un's wife should have
LINE 60: contracted a sudden illness and departed this life, and that Yü-ts'un
LINE 61: should have at once raised her to the rank of first wife. Her destiny is
LINE 62: adequately expressed by the lines:
LINE 63: Through but one single, casual look
LINE 64: Soon an exalted place she took.
LINE 65: The fact is that after Yü-ts'un had been presented with the money by
LINE 66: Shih-yin, he promptly started on the 16th day for the capital, and at
LINE 67: the triennial great tripos, his wishes were gratified to the full.
LINE 68: Having successfully carried off his degree of graduate of the third
LINE 69: rank, his name was put by selection on the list for provincial
LINE 70: appointments. By this time, he had been raised to the rank of Magistrate
LINE 71: in this district; but, in spite of the excellence and sufficiency of his
LINE 72: accomplishments and abilities, he could not escape being ambitious and
LINE 73: overbearing. He failed besides, confident as he was in his own merits,
LINE 74: in respect toward his superiors, with the result that these officials
LINE 75: looked upon him scornfully with the corner of the eye.
LINE 76: A year had hardly elapsed, when he was readily denounced in a memorial
LINE 77: to the Throne by the High Provincial authorities, who represented that
LINE 78: he was of a haughty disposition, that he had taken upon himself to
LINE 79: introduce innovations in the rites and ceremonies, that overtly, while
LINE 80: he endeavoured to enjoy the reputation of probity and uprightness, he,
LINE 81: secretly, combined the nature of the tiger and wolf; with the
LINE 82: consequence that he had been the cause of much trouble in the district,
LINE 83: and that he had made life intolerable for the people, &c. &c.
LINE 84: The Dragon countenance of the Emperor was considerably incensed. His
LINE 85: Majesty lost no time in issuing commands, in reply to the Memorial, that
LINE 86: he should be deprived of his official status.
LINE 87: On the arrival of the despatch from the Board, great was the joy felt by
LINE 88: every officer, without exception, of the prefecture in which he had held
LINE 89: office. Yü-ts'un, though at heart intensely mortified and incensed,
LINE 90: betrayed not the least outward symptom of annoyance, but still
LINE 91: preserved, as of old, a smiling and cheerful countenance.
LINE 92: He handed over charge of all official business and removed the savings
LINE 93: which he had accumulated during the several years he had been in office,
LINE 94: his family and all his chattels to his original home; where, after
LINE 95: having put everything in proper order, he himself travelled (carried the
LINE 96: winds and sleeved the moon) far and wide, visiting every relic of note
LINE 97: in the whole Empire.
LINE 98: As luck would have it, on a certain day while making a second journey
LINE 99: through the Wei Yang district, he heard the news that the Salt
LINE 100: Commissioner appointed this year was Lin Ju-hai. This Lin Ju-hai's
LINE 101: family name was Lin, his name Hai and his style Ju-hai. He had obtained
LINE 102: the third place in the previous triennial examination, and had, by this
LINE 103: time, already risen to the rank of Director of the Court of Censors. He
LINE 104: was a native of Kú Su. He had been recently named by Imperial
LINE 105: appointment a Censor attached to the Salt Inspectorate, and had arrived
LINE 106: at his post only a short while back.
LINE 107: In fact, the ancestors of Lin Ju-hai had, from years back, successively
LINE 108: inherited the title of Marquis, which rank, by its present descent to
LINE 109: Ju-hai, had already been enjoyed by five generations. When first
LINE 110: conferred, the hereditary right to the title had been limited to three
LINE 111: generations; but of late years, by an act of magnanimous favour and
LINE 112: generous beneficence, extraordinary bounty had been superadded; and on
LINE 113: the arrival of the succession to the father of Ju-hai, the right had
LINE 114: been extended to another degree. It had now descended to Ju-hai, who
LINE 115: had, besides this title of nobility, begun his career as a successful
LINE 116: graduate. But though his family had been through uninterrupted ages the
LINE 117: recipient of imperial bounties, his kindred had all been anyhow men of
LINE 118: culture.
LINE 119: The only misfortune had been that the several branches of the Lin family
LINE 120: had not been prolific, so that the numbers of its members continued
LINE 121: limited; and though there existed several households, they were all
LINE 122: however to Ju-hai no closer relatives than first cousins. Neither were
LINE 123: there any connections of the same lineage, or of the same parentage.
LINE 124: Ju-hai was at this date past forty; and had only had a son, who had died
LINE 125: the previous year, in the third year of his age. Though he had several
LINE 126: handmaids, he had not had the good fortune of having another son; but
LINE 127: this was too a matter that could not be remedied.
LINE 128: By his wife, née Chia, he had a daughter, to whom the infant name of Tai
LINE 129: Yü was given. She was, at this time, in her fifth year. Upon her the
LINE 130: parents doated as much as if she were a brilliant pearl in the palm of
LINE 131: their hand. Seeing that she was endowed with natural gifts of
LINE 132: intelligence and good looks, they also felt solicitous to bestow upon
LINE 133: her a certain knowledge of books, with no other purpose than that of
LINE 134: satisfying, by this illusory way, their wishes of having a son to
LINE 135: nurture and of dispelling the anguish felt by them, on account of the
LINE 136: desolation and void in their family circle (round their knees).
LINE 137: But to proceed. Yü-ts'un, while sojourning at an inn, was unexpectedly
LINE 138: laid up with a violent chill. Finding on his recovery, that his funds
LINE 139: were not sufficient to pay his expenses, he was thinking of looking out
LINE 140: for some house where he could find a resting place when he suddenly came
LINE 141: across two friends acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner. Knowing
LINE 142: that this official was desirous to find a tutor to instruct his
LINE 143: daughter, they lost no time in recommending Yü-ts'un, who moved into the
LINE 144: Yamên.
LINE 145: His female pupil was youthful in years and delicate in physique, so that
LINE 146: her lessons were irregular. Besides herself, there were only two waiting
LINE 147: girls, who remained in attendance during the hours of study, so that
LINE 148: Yü-ts'un was spared considerable trouble and had a suitable opportunity
LINE 149: to attend to the improvement of his health.
LINE 150: In a twinkle, another year and more slipped by, and when least expected,
LINE 151: the mother of his ward, née Chia, was carried away after a short
LINE 152: illness. His pupil (during her mother's sickness) was dutiful in her
LINE 153: attendance, and prepared the medicines for her use. (And after her
LINE 154: death,) she went into the deepest mourning prescribed by the rites, and
LINE 155: gave way to such excess of grief that, naturally delicate as she was,
LINE 156: her old complaint, on this account, broke out anew.
LINE 157: Being unable for a considerable time to prosecute her studies, Yü-ts'un
LINE 158: lived at leisure and had no duties to attend to. Whenever therefore the
LINE 159: wind was genial and the sun mild, he was wont to stroll at random, after
LINE 160: he had done with his meals.
LINE 161: On this particular day, he, by some accident, extended his walk beyond
LINE 162: the suburbs, and desirous to contemplate the nature of the rustic
LINE 163: scenery, he, with listless step, came up to a spot encircled by hills
LINE 164: and streaming pools, by luxuriant clumps of trees and thick groves of
LINE 165: bamboos. Nestling in the dense foliage stood a temple. The doors and
LINE 166: courts were in ruins. The walls, inner and outer, in disrepair. An
LINE 167: inscription on a tablet testified that this was the temple of Spiritual
LINE 168: Perception. On the sides of the door was also a pair of old and
LINE 169: dilapidated scrolls with the following enigmatical verses.
LINE 170: Behind ample there is, yet to retract the hand, the mind heeds not,
LINE 171: until.
LINE 172: Before the mortal vision lies no path, when comes to turn the will.
LINE 173: "These two sentences," Yü-ts'un pondered after perusal, "although simple
LINE 174: in language, are profound in signification. I have previous to this
LINE 175: visited many a spacious temple, located on hills of note, but never have
LINE 176: I beheld an inscription referring to anything of the kind. The meaning
LINE 177: contained in these words must, I feel certain, owe their origin to the
LINE 178: experiences of some person or other; but there's no saying. But why
LINE 179: should I not go in and inquire for myself?"
LINE 180: Upon walking in, he at a glance caught sight of no one else, but of a
LINE 181: very aged bonze, of unkempt appearance, cooking his rice. When Yü-ts'un
LINE 182: perceived that he paid no notice, he went up to him and asked him one or
LINE 183: two questions, but as the old priest was dull of hearing and a dotard,
LINE 184: and as he had lost his teeth, and his tongue was blunt, he made most
LINE 185: irrelevant replies.
LINE 186: Yü-ts'un lost all patience with him, and withdrew again from the
LINE 187: compound with the intention of going as far as the village public house
LINE 188: to have a drink or two, so as to enhance the enjoyment of the rustic
LINE 189: scenery. With easy stride, he accordingly walked up to the place.
LINE 190: Scarcely had he passed the threshold of the public house, when he
LINE 191: perceived some one or other among the visitors who had been sitting
LINE 192: sipping their wine on the divan, jump up and come up to greet him, with
LINE 193: a face beaming with laughter.
LINE 194: "What a strange meeting! What a strange meeting!" he exclaimed aloud.
LINE 195: Yü-ts'un speedily looked at him, (and remembered) that this person had,
LINE 196: in past days, carried on business in a curio establishment in the
LINE 197: capital, and that his surname was Leng and his style Tzu-hsing.
LINE 198: A mutual friendship had existed between them during their sojourn, in
LINE 199: days of yore, in the capital; and as Yü-ts'un had entertained the
LINE 200: highest opinion of Leng Tzu-hsing, as being a man of action and of great
LINE 201: abilities, while this Leng Tzu-hsing, on the other hand, borrowed of the
LINE 202: reputation of refinement enjoyed by Yü-ts'un, the two had consequently
LINE 203: all along lived in perfect harmony and companionship.
LINE 204: "When did you get here?" Yü-ts'un eagerly inquired also smilingly. "I
LINE 205: wasn't in the least aware of your arrival. This unexpected meeting is
LINE 206: positively a strange piece of good fortune."
LINE 207: "I went home," Tzu-hsing replied, "about the close of last year, but now
LINE 208: as I am again bound to the capital, I passed through here on my way to
LINE 209: look up a friend of mine and talk some matters over. He had the kindness
LINE 210: to press me to stay with him for a couple of days longer, and as I after
LINE 211: all have no urgent business to attend to, I am tarrying a few days, but
LINE 212: purpose starting about the middle of the moon. My friend is busy to-day,
LINE 213: so I roamed listlessly as far as here, never dreaming of such a
LINE 214: fortunate meeting."
LINE 215: While speaking, he made Yü-ts'un sit down at the same table, and ordered
LINE 216: a fresh supply of wine and eatables; and as the two friends chatted of
LINE 217: one thing and another, they slowly sipped their wine.
LINE 218: The conversation ran on what had occurred after the separation, and
LINE 219: Yü-ts'un inquired, "Is there any news of any kind in the capital?"
LINE 220: "There's nothing new whatever," answered Tzu-hsing. "There is one thing
LINE 221: however: in the family of one of your worthy kinsmen, of the same name
LINE 222: as yourself, a trifling, but yet remarkable, occurrence has taken
LINE 223: place."
LINE 224: "None of my kindred reside in the capital," rejoined Yü-ts'un with a
LINE 225: smile. "To what can you be alluding?"
LINE 226: "How can it be that you people who have the same surname do not belong
LINE 227: to one clan?" remarked Tzu-hsing, sarcastically.
LINE 228: "In whose family?" inquired Yü-ts'un.
LINE 229: "The Chia family," replied Tzu-hsing smiling, "whose quarters are in the
LINE 230: Jung Kuo Mansion, does not after all reflect discredit upon the lintel
LINE 231: of your door, my venerable friend."
LINE 232: "What!" exclaimed Yü-ts'un, "did this affair take place in that family?
LINE 233: Were we to begin reckoning, we would find the members of my clan to be
LINE 234: anything but limited in number. Since the time of our ancestor Chia Fu,
LINE 235: who lived while the Eastern Han dynasty occupied the Throne, the
LINE 236: branches of our family have been numerous and flourishing; they are now
LINE 237: to be found in every single province, and who could, with any accuracy,
LINE 238: ascertain their whereabouts? As regards the Jung-kuo branch in
LINE 239: particular, their names are in fact inscribed on the same register as
LINE 240: our own, but rich and exalted as they are, we have never presumed to
LINE 241: claim them as our relatives, so that we have become more and more
LINE 242: estranged."
LINE 243: "Don't make any such assertions," Tzu-hsing remarked with a sigh, "the
LINE 244: present two mansions of Jung and Ning have both alike also suffered
LINE 245: reverses, and they cannot come up to their state of days of yore."
LINE 246: "Up to this day, these two households of Ning and of Jung," Yü-ts'un
LINE 247: suggested, "still maintain a very large retinue of people, and how can
LINE 248: it be that they have met with reverses?"
LINE 249: "To explain this would be indeed a long story," said Leng Tzu-hsing.
LINE 250: "Last year," continued Yü-ts'un, "I arrived at Chin Ling, as I
LINE 251: entertained a wish to visit the remains of interest of the six
LINE 252: dynasties, and as I on that day entered the walled town of Shih T'ou, I
LINE 253: passed by the entrance of that old residence. On the east side of the
LINE 254: street, stood the Ning Kuo mansion; on the west the Jung Kuo mansion;
LINE 255: and these two, adjoining each other as they do, cover in fact well-nigh
LINE 256: half of the whole length of the street. Outside the front gate
LINE 257: everything was, it is true, lonely and deserted; but at a glance into
LINE 258: the interior over the enclosing wall, I perceived that the halls,
LINE 259: pavilions, two-storied structures and porches presented still a majestic
LINE 260: and lofty appearance. Even the flower garden, which extends over the
LINE 261: whole area of the back grounds, with its trees and rockeries, also
LINE 262: possessed to that day an air of luxuriance and freshness, which betrayed
LINE 263: no signs of a ruined or decrepid establishment."
LINE 264: "You have had the good fortune of starting in life as a graduate,"
LINE 265: explained Tzu-tsing as he smiled, "and yet are not aware of the saying
LINE 266: uttered by some one of old: that a centipede even when dead does not lie
LINE 267: stiff. (These families) may, according to your version, not be up to the
LINE 268: prosperity of former years, but, compared with the family of an ordinary
LINE 269: official, their condition anyhow presents a difference. Of late the
LINE 270: number of the inmates has, day by day, been on the increase; their
LINE 271: affairs have become daily more numerous; of masters and servants, high
LINE 272: and low, who live in ease and respectability very many there are; but of
LINE 273: those who exercise any forethought, or make any provision, there is not
LINE 274: even one. In their daily wants, their extravagances, and their
LINE 275: expenditure, they are also unable to adapt themselves to circumstances
LINE 276: and practise economy; (so that though) the present external framework
LINE 277: may not have suffered any considerable collapse, their purses have
LINE 278: anyhow begun to feel an exhausting process! But this is a mere trifle.
LINE 279: There is another more serious matter. Would any one ever believe that in
LINE 280: such families of official status, in a clan of education and culture,
LINE 281: the sons and grandsons of the present age would after all be each
LINE 282: (succeeding) generation below the standard of the former?"
LINE 283: Yü-ts'un, having listened to these remarks, observed: "How ever can it
LINE 284: be possible that families of such education and refinement can observe
LINE 285: any system of training and nurture which is not excellent? Concerning
LINE 286: the other branches, I am not in a position to say anything; but
LINE 287: restricting myself to the two mansions of Jung and Ning, they are those
LINE 288: in which, above all others, the education of their children is
LINE 289: methodical."
LINE 290: "I was just now alluding to none other than these two establishments,"
LINE 291: Tzu-hsing observed with a sigh; "but let me tell you all. In days of
LINE 292: yore, the duke of Ning Kuo and the duke of Jung Kuo were two uterine
LINE 293: brothers. The Ning duke was the elder; he had four sons. After the death
LINE 294: of the duke of Ning Kuo, his eldest son, Chia Tai-hua, came into the
LINE 295: title. He also had two sons; but the eldest, whose name was Hu, died at
LINE 296: the age of eight or nine; and the only survivor, the second son, Chia
LINE 297: Ching, inherited the title. His whole mind is at this time set upon
LINE 298: Taoist doctrines; his sole delight is to burn the pill and refine the
LINE 299: dual powers; while every other thought finds no place in his mind.
LINE 300: Happily, he had, at an early age, left a son, Chia Chen, behind in the
LINE 301: lay world, and his father, engrossed as his whole heart was with the
LINE 302: idea of attaining spiritual life, ceded the succession of the official
LINE 303: title to him. His parent is, besides, not willing to return to the
LINE 304: original family seat, but lives outside the walls of the capital,
LINE 305: foolishly hobnobbing with all the Taoist priests. This Mr. Chen had also
LINE 306: a son, Chia Jung, who is, at this period, just in his sixteenth year.
LINE 307: Mr. Ching gives at present no attention to anything at all, so that Mr.
LINE 308: Chen naturally devotes no time to his studies, but being bent upon
LINE 309: nought else but incessant high pleasure, he has subversed the order of
LINE 310: things in the Ning Kuo mansion, and yet no one can summon the courage to
LINE 311: come and hold him in check. But I'll now tell you about the Jung mansion
LINE 312: for your edification. The strange occurrence, to which I alluded just
LINE 313: now, came about in this manner. After the demise of the Jung duke, the
LINE 314: eldest son, Chia Tai-shan, inherited the rank. He took to himself as
LINE 315: wife, the daughter of Marquis Shih, a noble family of Chin Ling, by whom
LINE 316: he had two sons; the elder being Chia She, the younger Chia Cheng. This
LINE 317: Tai Shan is now dead long ago; but his wife is still alive, and the
LINE 318: elder son, Chia She, succeeded to the degree. He is a man of amiable and
LINE 319: genial disposition, but he likewise gives no thought to the direction of
LINE 320: any domestic concern. The second son Chia Cheng displayed, from his
LINE 321: early childhood, a great liking for books, and grew up to be correct and
LINE 322: upright in character. His grandfather doated upon him, and would have
LINE 323: had him start in life through the arena of public examinations, but,
LINE 324: when least expected, Tai-shan, being on the point of death, bequeathed a
LINE 325: petition, which was laid before the Emperor. His Majesty, out of regard
LINE 326: for his former minister, issued immediate commands that the elder son
LINE 327: should inherit the estate, and further inquired how many sons there were
LINE 328: besides him, all of whom he at once expressed a wish to be introduced in
LINE 329: his imperial presence. His Majesty, moreover, displayed exceptional
LINE 330: favour, and conferred upon Mr. Cheng the brevet rank of second class
LINE 331: Assistant Secretary (of a Board), and commanded him to enter the Board
LINE 332: to acquire the necessary experience. He has already now been promoted to
LINE 333: the office of second class Secretary. This Mr. Cheng's wife, nèe Wang,
LINE 334: first gave birth to a son called Chia Chu, who became a Licentiate in
LINE 335: his fourteenth year. At barely twenty, he married, but fell ill and died
LINE 336: soon after the birth of a son. Her (Mrs. Cheng's) second child was a
LINE 337: daughter, who came into the world, by a strange coincidence, on the
LINE 338: first day of the year. She had an unexpected (pleasure) in the birth,
LINE 339: the succeeding year, of another son, who, still more remarkable to say,
LINE 340: had, at the time of his birth, a piece of variegated and crystal-like
LINE 341: brilliant jade in his mouth, on which were yet visible the outlines of
LINE 342: several characters. Now, tell me, was not this a novel and strange
LINE 343: occurrence? eh?"
LINE 344: "Strange indeed!" exclaimed Yü-ts'un with a smile; "but I presume the
LINE 345: coming experiences of this being will not be mean."
LINE 346: Tzu-hsing gave a faint smile. "One and all," he remarked, "entertain the
LINE 347: same idea. Hence it is that his mother doats upon him like upon a
LINE 348: precious jewel. On the day of his first birthday, Mr. Cheng readily
LINE 349: entertained a wish to put the bent of his inclinations to the test, and
LINE 350: placed before the child all kinds of things, without number, for him to
LINE 351: grasp from. Contrary to every expectation, he scorned every other
LINE 352: object, and, stretching forth his hand, he simply took hold of rouge,
LINE 353: powder and a few hair-pins, with which he began to play. Mr. Cheng
LINE 354: experienced at once displeasure, as he maintained that this youth would,
LINE 355: by and bye, grow up into a sybarite, devoted to wine and women, and for
LINE 356: this reason it is, that he soon began to feel not much attachment for
LINE 357: him. But his grandmother is the one who, in spite of everything, prizes
LINE 358: him like the breath of her own life. The very mention of what happened
LINE 359: is even strange! He is now grown up to be seven or eight years old, and,
LINE 360: although exceptionally wilful, in intelligence and precocity, however,
LINE 361: not one in a hundred could come up to him! And as for the utterances of
LINE 362: this child, they are no less remarkable. The bones and flesh of woman,
LINE 363: he argues, are made of water, while those of man of mud. 'Women to my
LINE 364: eyes are pure and pleasing,' he says, 'while at the sight of man, I
LINE 365: readily feel how corrupt, foul and repelling they are!' Now tell me, are
LINE 366: not these words ridiculous? There can be no doubt whatever that he will
LINE 367: by and bye turn out to be a licentious roué."
LINE 368: Yü-ts'un, whose countenance suddenly assumed a stern air, promptly
LINE 369: interrupted the conversation. "It doesn't quite follow," he suggested.
LINE 370: "You people don't, I regret to say, understand the destiny of this
LINE 371: child. The fact is that even the old Hanlin scholar Mr. Cheng was
LINE 372: erroneously looked upon as a loose rake and dissolute debauchee! But
LINE 373: unless a person, through much study of books and knowledge of letters,
LINE 374: so increases (in lore) as to attain the talent of discerning the nature
LINE 375: of things, and the vigour of mind to fathom the Taoist reason as well as
LINE 376: to comprehend the first principle, he is not in a position to form any
LINE 377: judgment."
LINE 378: Tzu-hsing upon perceiving the weighty import of what he propounded,
LINE 379: "Please explain," he asked hastily, "the drift (of your argument)." To
LINE 380: which Yü-ts'un responded: "Of the human beings created by the operation
LINE 381: of heaven and earth, if we exclude those who are gifted with extreme
LINE 382: benevolence and extreme viciousness, the rest, for the most part,
LINE 383: present no striking diversity. If they be extremely benevolent, they
LINE 384: fall in, at the time of their birth, with an era of propitious fortune;
LINE 385: while those extremely vicious correspond, at the time of their
LINE 386: existence, with an era of calamity. When those who coexist with
LINE 387: propitious fortune come into life, the world is in order; when those who
LINE 388: coexist with unpropitious fortune come into life, the world is in
LINE 389: danger. Yao, Shun, Yü, Ch'eng T'ang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang, Chou Kung, Chao
LINE 390: Kung, Confucius, Mencius, T'ung Hu, Han Hsin, Chou Tzu, Ch'eng Tzu, Chu
LINE 391: Tzu and Chang Tzu were ordained to see light in an auspicious era.
LINE 392: Whereas Ch'i Yu, Kung Kung, Chieh Wang, Chou Wang, Shih Huang, Wang
LINE 393: Mang, Tsao Ts'ao, Wen Wen, An Hu-shan, Ch'in Kuei and others were one
LINE 394: and all destined to come into the world during a calamitous age. Those
LINE 395: endowed with extreme benevolence set the world in order; those possessed
LINE 396: of extreme maliciousness turn the world into disorder. Purity,
LINE 397: intelligence, spirituality and subtlety constitute the vital spirit of
LINE 398: right which pervades heaven and earth, and the persons gifted with
LINE 399: benevolence are its natural fruit. Malignity and perversity constitute
LINE 400: the spirit of evil, which permeates heaven and earth, and malicious
LINE 401: persons are affected by its influence. The days of perpetual happiness
LINE 402: and eminent good fortune, and the era of perfect peace and tranquility,
LINE 403: which now prevail, are the offspring of the pure, intelligent, divine
LINE 404: and subtle spirit which ascends above, to the very Emperor, and below
LINE 405: reaches the rustic and uncultured classes. Every one is without
LINE 406: exception under its influence. The superfluity of the subtle spirit
LINE 407: expands far and wide, and finding nowhere to betake itself to, becomes,
LINE 408: in due course, transformed into dew, or gentle breeze; and, by a process
LINE 409: of diffusion, it pervades the whole world.
LINE 410: "The spirit of malignity and perversity, unable to expand under the
LINE 411: brilliant sky and transmuting sun, eventually coagulates, pervades and
LINE 412: stops up the deep gutters and extensive caverns; and when of a sudden
LINE 413: the wind agitates it or it be impelled by the clouds, and any slight
LINE 414: disposition, on its part, supervenes to set itself in motion, or to
LINE 415: break its bounds, and so little as even the minutest fraction does
LINE 416: unexpectedly find an outlet, and happens to come across any spirit of
LINE 417: perception and subtlety which may be at the time passing by, the spirit
LINE 418: of right does not yield to the spirit of evil, and the spirit of evil is
LINE 419: again envious of the spirit of right, so that the two do not harmonize.
LINE 420: Just like wind, water, thunder and lightning, which, when they meet in
LINE 421: the bowels of the earth, must necessarily, as they are both to dissolve
LINE 422: and are likewise unable to yield, clash and explode to the end that they
LINE 423: may at length exhaust themselves. Hence it is that these spirits have
LINE 424: also forcibly to diffuse themselves into the human race to find an
LINE 425: outlet, so that they may then completely disperse, with the result that
LINE 426: men and women are suddenly imbued with these spirits and spring into
LINE 427: existence. At best, (these human beings) cannot be generated into
LINE 428: philanthropists or perfect men; at worst, they cannot also embody
LINE 429: extreme perversity or extreme wickedness. Yet placed among one million
LINE 430: beings, the spirit of intelligence, refinement, perception and subtlety
LINE 431: will be above these one million beings; while, on the other hand, the
LINE 432: perverse, depraved and inhuman embodiment will likewise be below the
LINE 433: million of men. Born in a noble and wealthy family, these men will be a
LINE 434: salacious, lustful lot; born of literary, virtuous or poor parentage,
LINE 435: they will turn out retired scholars or men of mark; though they may by
LINE 436: some accident be born in a destitute and poverty-stricken home, they
LINE 437: cannot possibly, in fact, ever sink so low as to become runners or
LINE 438: menials, or contentedly brook to be of the common herd or to be driven
LINE 439: and curbed like a horse in harness. They will become, for a certainty,
LINE 440: either actors of note or courtesans of notoriety; as instanced in former
LINE 441: years by Hsü Yu, T'ao Ch'ien, Yuan Chi, Chi Kang, Liu Ling, the two
LINE 442: families of Wang and Hsieh, Ku Hu-t'ou, Ch'en Hou-chu, T'ang Ming-huang,
LINE 443: Sung Hui-tsung, Liu T'ing-chih, Wen Fei-ching, Mei Nan-kung, Shih
LINE 444: Man-ch'ing, Lui C'hih-ch'ing and Chin Shao-yu, and exemplified
LINE 445: now-a-days by Ni Yün-lin, T'ang Po-hu, Chu Chih-shan, and also by Li
LINE 446: Kuei-men, Huang P'an-cho, Ching Hsin-mo, Cho Wen-chün; and the women
LINE 447: Hung Fu, Hsieh T'ao, Ch'ü Ying, Ch'ao Yün and others; all of whom were
LINE 448: and are of the same stamp, though placed in different scenes of action."
LINE 449: "From what you say," observed Tzu-hsing, "success makes (a man) a duke
LINE 450: or a marquis; ruin, a thief!"
LINE 451: "Quite so; that's just my idea!" replied Yü-ts'un; "I've not as yet let
LINE 452: you know that after my degradation from office, I spent the last couple
LINE 453: of years in travelling for pleasure all over each province, and that I
LINE 454: also myself came across two extraordinary youths. This is why, when a
LINE 455: short while back you alluded to this Pao-yü, I at once conjectured, with
LINE 456: a good deal of certainty, that he must be a human being of the same
LINE 457: stamp. There's no need for me to speak of any farther than the walled
LINE 458: city of Chin Ling. This Mr. Chen was, by imperial appointment, named
LINE 459: Principal of the Government Public College of the Chin Ling province. Do
LINE 460: you perhaps know him?"
LINE 461: "Who doesn't know him?" remarked Tzu-hsing. "This Chen family is an old
LINE 462: connection of the Chia family. These two families were on terms of great
LINE 463: intimacy, and I myself likewise enjoyed the pleasure of their friendship
LINE 464: for many a day."
LINE 465: "Last year, when at Chin Ling," Yü-ts'un continued with a smile, "some
LINE 466: one recommended me as resident tutor to the school in the Chen mansion;
LINE 467: and when I moved into it I saw for myself the state of things. Who would
LINE 468: ever think that that household was grand and luxurious to such a degree!
LINE 469: But they are an affluent family, and withal full of propriety, so that a
LINE 470: school like this was of course not one easy to obtain. The pupil,
LINE 471: however, was, it is true, a young tyro, but far more troublesome to
LINE 472: teach than a candidate for the examination of graduate of the second
LINE 473: degree. Were I to enter into details, you would indeed have a laugh. 'I
LINE 474: must needs,' he explained, 'have the company of two girls in my studies
LINE 475: to enable me to read at all, and to keep likewise my brain clear.
LINE 476: Otherwise, if left to myself, my head gets all in a muddle.' Time after
LINE 477: time, he further expounded to his young attendants, how extremely
LINE 478: honourable and extremely pure were the two words representing woman,
LINE 479: that they are more valuable and precious than the auspicious animal, the
LINE 480: felicitous bird, rare flowers and uncommon plants. 'You may not' (he was
LINE 481: wont to say), 'on any account heedlessly utter them, you set of foul
LINE 482: mouths and filthy tongues! these two words are of the utmost import!
LINE 483: Whenever you have occasion to allude to them, you must, before you can
LINE 484: do so with impunity, take pure water and scented tea and rinse your
LINE 485: mouths. In the event of any slip of the tongue, I shall at once have
LINE 486: your teeth extracted, and your eyes gouged out.' His obstinacy and
LINE 487: waywardness are, in every respect, out of the common. After he was
LINE 488: allowed to leave school, and to return home, he became, at the sight of
LINE 489: the young ladies, so tractable, gentle, sharp, and polite, transformed,
LINE 490: in fact, like one of them. And though, for this reason, his father has
LINE 491: punished him on more than one occasion, by giving him a sound thrashing,
LINE 492: such as brought him to the verge of death, he cannot however change.
LINE 493: Whenever he was being beaten, and could no more endure the pain, he was
LINE 494: wont to promptly break forth in promiscuous loud shouts, 'Girls! girls!'
LINE 495: The young ladies, who heard him from the inner chambers, subsequently
LINE 496: made fun of him. 'Why,' they said, 'when you are being thrashed, and you
LINE 497: are in pain, your only thought is to bawl out girls! Is it perchance
LINE 498: that you expect us young ladies to go and intercede for you? How is that
LINE 499: you have no sense of shame?' To their taunts he gave a most plausible
LINE 500: explanation. 'Once,' he replied, 'when in the agony of pain, I gave vent
LINE 501: to shouting girls, in the hope, perchance, I did not then know, of its
LINE 502: being able to alleviate the soreness. After I had, with this purpose,
LINE 503: given one cry, I really felt the pain considerably better; and now that
LINE 504: I have obtained this secret spell, I have recourse, at once, when I am
LINE 505: in the height of anguish, to shouts of girls, one shout after another.
LINE 506: Now what do you say to this? Isn't this absurd, eh?"
LINE 507: "The grandmother is so infatuated by her extreme tenderness for this
LINE 508: youth, that, time after time, she has, on her grandson's account, found
LINE 509: fault with the tutor, and called her son to task, with the result that I
LINE 510: resigned my post and took my leave. A youth, with a disposition such as
LINE 511: his, cannot assuredly either perpetuate intact the estate of his father
LINE 512: and grandfather, or follow the injunctions of teacher or advice of
LINE 513: friends. The pity is, however, that there are, in that family, several
LINE 514: excellent female cousins, the like of all of whom it would be difficult
LINE 515: to discover."
LINE 516: "Quite so!" remarked Tzu-hsing; "there are now three young ladies in the
LINE 517: Chia family who are simply perfection itself. The eldest is a daughter
LINE 518: of Mr. Cheng, Yuan Ch'un by name, who, on account of her excellence,
LINE 519: filial piety, talents, and virtue, has been selected as a governess in
LINE 520: the palace. The second is the daughter of Mr. She's handmaid, and is
LINE 521: called Ying Ch'un; the third is T'an Ch'un, the child of Mr. Cheng's
LINE 522: handmaid; while the fourth is the uterine sister of Mr. Chen of the Ning
LINE 523: Mansion. Her name is Hsi Ch'un. As dowager lady Shih is so fondly
LINE 524: attached to her granddaughters, they come, for the most part, over to
LINE 525: their grandmother's place to prosecute their studies together, and each
LINE 526: one of these girls is, I hear, without a fault."
LINE 527: "More admirable," observed Yü-ts'un, "is the régime (adhered to) in the
LINE 528: Chen family, where the names of the female children have all been
LINE 529: selected from the list of male names, and are unlike all those
LINE 530: out-of-the-way names, such as Spring Blossom, Scented Gem, and the like
LINE 531: flowery terms in vogue in other families. But how is it that the Chia
LINE 532: family have likewise fallen into this common practice?"
LINE 533: "Not so!" ventured Tzu-h'sing. "It is simply because the eldest daughter
LINE 534: was born on the first of the first moon, that the name of Yuan Ch'un was
LINE 535: given to her; while with the rest this character Ch'un (spring) was then
LINE 536: followed. The names of the senior generation are, in like manner,
LINE 537: adopted from those of their brothers; and there is at present an
LINE 538: instance in support of this. The wife of your present worthy master, Mr.
LINE 539: Lin, is the uterine sister of Mr. Chia. She and Mr. Chia Cheng, and she
LINE 540: went, while at home, under the name of Chia Min. Should you question the
LINE 541: truth of what I say, you are at liberty, on your return, to make minute
LINE 542: inquiries and you'll be convinced."
LINE 543: Yü-ts'un clapped his hands and said smiling, "It's so, I know! for this
LINE 544: female pupil of mine, whose name is Tai-yü, invariably pronounces the
LINE 545: character _min_ as _mi_, whenever she comes across it in the
LINE 546: course of her reading; while, in writing, when she comes to the
LINE 547: character 'min,' she likewise reduces the strokes by one, sometimes by
LINE 548: two. Often have I speculated in my mind (as to the cause), but the
LINE 549: remarks I've heard you mention, convince me, without doubt, that it is
LINE 550: no other reason (than that of reverence to her mother's name). Strange
LINE 551: enough, this pupil of mine is unique in her speech and deportment, and
LINE 552: in no way like any ordinary young lady. But considering that her mother
LINE 553: was no commonplace woman herself, it is natural that she should have
LINE 554: given birth to such a child. Besides, knowing, as I do now, that she is
LINE 555: the granddaughter of the Jung family, it is no matter of surprise to me
LINE 556: that she is what she is. Poor girl, her mother, after all, died in the
LINE 557: course of the last month."
LINE 558: Tzu-hsing heaved a sigh. "Of three elderly sisters," he explained, "this
LINE 559: one was the youngest, and she too is gone! Of the sisters of the senior
LINE 560: generation not one even survives! But now we'll see what the husbands of
LINE 561: this younger generation will be like by and bye!"
LINE 562: "Yes," replied Yü-ts'un. "But some while back you mentioned that Mr.
LINE 563: Cheng has had a son, born with a piece of jade in his mouth, and that he
LINE 564: has besides a tender-aged grandson left by his eldest son; but is it
LINE 565: likely that this Mr. She has not, himself, as yet, had any male issue?"
LINE 566: "After Mr. Cheng had this son with the jade," Tzu-hsing added, "his
LINE 567: handmaid gave birth to another son, who whether he be good or bad, I
LINE 568: don't at all know. At all events, he has by his side two sons and a
LINE 569: grandson, but what these will grow up to be by and bye, I cannot tell.
LINE 570: As regards Mr. Chia She, he too has had two sons; the second of whom,
LINE 571: Chia Lien, is by this time about twenty. He took to wife a relative of
LINE 572: his, a niece of Mr. Cheng's wife, a Miss Wang, and has now been married
LINE 573: for the last two years. This Mr. Lien has lately obtained by purchase
LINE 574: the rank of sub-prefect. He too takes little pleasure in books, but as
LINE 575: far as worldly affairs go, he is so versatile and glib of tongue, that
LINE 576: he has recently taken up his quarters with his uncle Mr. Cheng, to whom
LINE 577: he gives a helping hand in the management of domestic matters. Who would
LINE 578: have thought it, however, ever since his marriage with his worthy wife,
LINE 579: not a single person, whether high or low, has there been who has not
LINE 580: looked up to her with regard: with the result that Mr. Lien himself has,
LINE 581: in fact, had to take a back seat (_lit_. withdrew 35 li). In looks,
LINE 582: she is also so extremely beautiful, in speech so extremely quick and
LINE 583: fluent, in ingenuity so deep and astute, that even a man could, in no
LINE 584: way, come up to her mark."
LINE 585: After hearing these remarks Yü-ts'un smiled. "You now perceive," he
LINE 586: said, "that my argument is no fallacy, and that the several persons
LINE 587: about whom you and I have just been talking are, we may presume, human
LINE 588: beings, who, one and all, have been generated by the spirit of right,
LINE 589: and the spirit of evil, and come to life by the same royal road; but of
LINE 590: course there's no saying."
LINE 591: "Enough," cried Tzu-hsing, "of right and enough of evil; we've been
LINE 592: doing nothing but settling other people's accounts; come now, have
LINE 593: another glass, and you'll be the better for it!"
LINE 594: "While bent upon talking," Yü-ts'un explained, "I've had more glasses
LINE 595: than is good for me."
LINE 596: "Speaking of irrelevant matters about other people," Tzu-hsing rejoined
LINE 597: complacently, "is quite the thing to help us swallow our wine; so come
LINE 598: now; what harm will happen, if we do have a few glasses more."
LINE 599: Yü-ts'un thereupon looked out of the window.
LINE 600: "The day is also far advanced," he remarked, "and if we don't take care,
LINE 601: the gates will be closing; let us leisurely enter the city, and as we go
LINE 602: along, there will be nothing to prevent us from continuing our chat."
LINE 603: Forthwith the two friends rose from their seats, settled and paid their
LINE 604: wine bill, and were just going, when they unexpectedly heard some one
LINE 605: from behind say with a loud voice:
LINE 606: "Accept my congratulations, Brother Yü-ts'un; I've now come, with the
LINE 607: express purpose of giving you the welcome news!"
LINE 608: Yü-ts'un lost no time in turning his head round to look at the speaker.
LINE 609: But reader, if you wish to learn who the man was, listen to the details
LINE 610: given in the following chapter.
