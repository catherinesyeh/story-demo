LINE 1: Wang Hsi-feng maliciously lays a trap for Chia Jui, under pretence
LINE 2: that his affection is reciprocated.
LINE 3: Chia T'ien-hsiang gazes at the face of the mirror of Voluptuousness.
LINE 4: Lady Feng, it must be noticed in continuation of our narrative, was just
LINE 5: engaged in talking with P'ing Erh, when they heard some one announce
LINE 6: that Mr. Jui had come. Lady Feng gave orders that he should be invited
LINE 7: to step in, and Chia Jui perceiving that he had been asked to walk in
LINE 8: was at heart elated at the prospect of seeing her.
LINE 9: With a face beaming with smiles, Lady Feng inquired again and again how
LINE 10: he was; and, with simulated tenderness she further pressed him to take a
LINE 11: seat and urged him to have a cup of tea.
LINE 12: Chia Jui noticed how still more voluptuous lady Feng looked in her
LINE 13: present costume, and, as his eyes burnt with love, "How is it," he
LINE 14: inquired, "that my elder brother Secundus is not yet back?"
LINE 15: "What the reason is I cannot tell," lady Feng said by way of reply.
LINE 16: "May it not be," Chia Jui smilingly insinuated, "that some fair damsel
LINE 17: has got hold of him on the way, and that he cannot brook to tear himself
LINE 18: from her to come home?"
LINE 19: "That makes it plain that there are those among men who fall in love
LINE 20: with any girl they cast their eyes on," hinted lady Feng.
LINE 21: "Your remarks are, sister-in-law, incorrect, for I'm none of this kind!"
LINE 22: Chia Jui explained smirkingly.
LINE 23: "How many like you can there be!" rejoined lady Feng with a sarcastic
LINE 24: smile; "in ten, not one even could be picked out!"
LINE 25: When Chia Jui heard these words, he felt in such high glee that he
LINE 26: rubbed his ears and smoothed his cheeks. "My sister-in-law," he
LINE 27: continued, "you must of course be extremely lonely day after day."
LINE 28: "Indeed I am," observed lady Feng, "and I only wish some one would come
LINE 29: and have a chat with me to break my dull monotony."
LINE 30: "I daily have ample leisure," Chia Jui ventured with a simper, "and
LINE 31: wouldn't it be well if I came every day to dispel your dulness,
LINE 32: sister-in-law?"
LINE 33: "You are simply fooling me," exclaimed lady Feng laughing. "It isn't
LINE 34: likely you would wish to come over here to me?"
LINE 35: "If in your presence, sister-in-law, I utter a single word of falsehood,
LINE 36: may the thunder from heaven blast me!" protested Chia Jui. "It's only
LINE 37: because I had all along heard people say that you were a dreadful
LINE 38: person, and that you cannot condone even the slightest shortcoming
LINE 39: committed in your presence, that I was induced to keep back by fear; but
LINE 40: after seeing you, on this occasion, so chatty, so full of fun and most
LINE 41: considerate to others, how can I not come? were it to be the cause of my
LINE 42: death, I would be even willing to come!"
LINE 43: "You're really a clever person," lady Feng observed sarcastically. "And
LINE 44: oh so much superior to both Chia Jung and his brother! Handsome as their
LINE 45: presence was to look at, I imagined their minds to be full of
LINE 46: intelligence, but who would have thought that they would, after all, be
LINE 47: a couple of stupid worms, without the least notion of human affection!"
LINE 48: The words which Chia Jui heard, fell in so much the more with his own
LINE 49: sentiments, that he could not restrain himself from again pressing
LINE 50: forward nearer to her; and as with eyes strained to give intentness to
LINE 51: his view, he gazed at lady Feng's purse: "What rings have you got on?"
LINE 52: he went on to ask.
LINE 53: "You should be a little more deferential," remonstrated lady Feng in a
LINE 54: low tone of voice, "so as not to let the waiting-maids detect us."
LINE 55: Chia Jui withdrew backward with as much alacrity as if he had received
LINE 56: an Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha.
LINE 57: "You ought to be going!" lady Feng suggested, as she gave him a smile.
LINE 58: "Do let me stay a while longer," entreated Chia Jui, "you are indeed
LINE 59: ruthless, my sister-in-law."
LINE 60: But with gentle voice did lady Feng again expostulate. "In broad
LINE 61: daylight," she said, "with people coming and going, it is not really
LINE 62: convenient that you should abide in here; so you had better go, and when
LINE 63: it's dark and the watch is set, you can come over, and quietly wait for
LINE 64: me in the corridor on the Eastern side!"
LINE 65: At these words, Chia Jui felt as if he had received some jewel or
LINE 66: precious thing. "Don't make fun of me!" he remarked with vehemence. "The
LINE 67: only thing is that crowds of people are ever passing from there, and how
LINE 68: will it be possible for me to evade detection?"
LINE 69: "Set your mind at ease!" lady Feng advised; "I shall dismiss on leave
LINE 70: all the youths on duty at night; and when the doors, on both sides, are
LINE 71: closed, there will be no one else to come in!"
LINE 72: Chia Jui was delighted beyond measure by the assurance, and with
LINE 73: impetuous haste, he took his leave and went off; convinced at heart of
LINE 74: the gratification of his wishes. He continued, up to the time of dusk, a
LINE 75: prey to keen expectation; and, when indeed darkness fell, he felt his
LINE 76: way into the Jung mansion, availing himself of the moment, when the
LINE 77: doors were being closed, to slip into the corridor, where everything was
LINE 78: actually pitch dark, and not a soul to be seen going backwards or
LINE 79: forwards.
LINE 80: The door leading over to dowager lady Chia's apartments had already been
LINE 81: put under key, and there was but one gate, the one on the East, which
LINE 82: had not as yet been locked. Chia Jui lent his ear, and listened for ever
LINE 83: so long, but he saw no one appear. Suddenly, however, was heard a sound
LINE 84: like "lo teng," and the east gate was also bolted; but though Chia Jui
LINE 85: was in a great state of impatience, he none the less did not venture to
LINE 86: utter a sound. All that necessity compelled him to do was to issue, with
LINE 87: quiet steps, from his corner, and to try the gates by pushing; but they
LINE 88: were closed as firmly as if they had been made fast with iron bolts; and
LINE 89: much though he may, at this juncture, have wished to find his way out,
LINE 90: escape was, in fact, out of the question; on the south and north was one
LINE 91: continuous dead wall, which, even had he wished to scale, there was
LINE 92: nothing which he could clutch and pull himself up by.
LINE 93: This room, besides, was one the interior (of which was exposed) to the
LINE 94: wind, which entered through (the fissure) of the door; and was perfectly
LINE 95: empty and bare; and the weather being, at this time, that of December,
LINE 96: and the night too very long, the northerly wind, with its biting gusts,
LINE 97: was sufficient to penetrate the flesh and to cleave the bones, so that
LINE 98: the whole night long he had a narrow escape from being frozen to death;
LINE 99: and he was yearning, with intolerable anxiety for the break of day, when
LINE 100: he espied an old matron go first and open the door on the East side, and
LINE 101: then come in and knock at the western gate.
LINE 102: Chia Jui seeing that she had turned her face away, bolted out, like a
LINE 103: streak of smoke, as he hugged his shoulders with his hands (from intense
LINE 104: cold.) As luck would have it, the hour was as yet early, so that the
LINE 105: inmates of the house had not all got out of bed; and making his escape
LINE 106: from the postern door, he straightaway betook himself home, running back
LINE 107: the whole way.
LINE 108: Chia Jui's parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an early
LINE 109: period, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to take
LINE 110: charge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along,
LINE 111: exercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to even
LINE 112: make one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about out
LINE 113: of doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies.
LINE 114: Seeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the whole
LINE 115: night, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain to
LINE 116: have run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating in
LINE 117: houses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gave
LINE 118: so much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that in
LINE 119: which he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole length
LINE 120: of the night he boiled with wrath.
LINE 121: Chia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state of
LINE 122: trepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) by
LINE 123: handfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourse
LINE 124: to deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldest
LINE 125: maternal uncle's house, and that when it got dark, they kept him to
LINE 126: spend the night there.
LINE 127: "Hitherto," remonstrated Tai-ju, "when about to go out of doors, you
LINE 128: never ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me about
LINE 129: it, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? for
LINE 130: this offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lie
LINE 131: imposed upon me."
LINE 132: Into such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that laying
LINE 133: hands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or forty
LINE 134: blows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, but
LINE 135: bade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing on
LINE 136: his mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for the
LINE 137: last ten days' lessons.
LINE 138: Chia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in the
LINE 139: next place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed by
LINE 140: the pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to drafts
LINE 141: reading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had to
LINE 142: endure were of manifold kinds.
LINE 143: Chia Jui's infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change;
LINE 144: but far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng was
LINE 145: humbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, the
LINE 146: first leisure moments to come again in search of that lady.
LINE 147: Lady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, and
LINE 148: Chia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establish
LINE 149: his innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord,
LINE 150: fallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but devise
LINE 151: another plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right and
LINE 152: mend his ways.
LINE 153: With this purpose, she gave him another assignation. "Don't go over
LINE 154: there," she said, "to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms giving
LINE 155: on to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. But
LINE 156: whatever you do, mind don't be reckless."
LINE 157: "Are you in real earnest?" Chia Jui inquired.
LINE 158: "Why, who wants to play with you?" replied lady Feng; "if you don't
LINE 159: believe what I say, well then don't come!"
LINE 160: "I'll come, I'll come, yea I'll come, were I even to die!" protested
LINE 161: Chia Jui.
LINE 162: "You should first at this very moment get away!" lady Feng having
LINE 163: suggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, success
LINE 164: would for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure in
LINE 165: anticipation (of his pleasure.)
LINE 166: During this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of her
LINE 167: resources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for her
LINE 168: victim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades of
LINE 169: darkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.
LINE 170: As luck would have it a relative of his happened to likewise come on
LINE 171: that very night to their house and to only leave after he had dinner
LINE 172: with them, and at an hour of the day when the lamps had already been
LINE 173: lit; but he had still to wait until his grandfather had retired to rest
LINE 174: before he could, at length with precipitate step, betake himself into
LINE 175: the Jung mansion.
LINE 176: Straightway he came into the rooms in the narrow passage, and waited
LINE 177: with as much trepidation as if he had been an ant in a hot pan. He
LINE 178: however waited and waited, but he saw no one arrive; he listened but not
LINE 179: even the sound of a voice reached his ear. His heart was full of intense
LINE 180: fear, and he could not restrain giving way to surmises and suspicion.
LINE 181: "May it not be," he thought, "that she is not coming again; and that I
LINE 182: may have once more to freeze for another whole night?"
LINE 183: While indulging in these erratic reflections, he discerned some one
LINE 184: coming, looking like a black apparition, who Chia Jui readily concluded,
LINE 185: in his mind, must be lady Feng; so that, unmindful of distinguishing
LINE 186: black from white, he as soon as that person arrived in front of him,
LINE 187: speedily clasped her in his embrace, like a ravenous tiger pouncing upon
LINE 188: its prey, or a cat clawing a rat, and cried: "My darling sister, you
LINE 189: have made me wait till I'm ready to die."
LINE 190: As he uttered these words, he dragged the comer, in his arms, on to the
LINE 191: couch in the room; and while indulging in kisses and protestations of
LINE 192: warm love, he began to cry out at random epithets of endearment.
LINE 193: Not a sound, however, came from the lips of the other person; and Chia
LINE 194: Jui had in the fulness of his passion, exceeded the bounds of timid love
LINE 195: and was in the act of becoming still more affectionate in his
LINE 196: protestations, when a sudden flash of a light struck his eye, by the
LINE 197: rays of which he espied Chia Se with a candle in hand, casting the light
LINE 198: round the place, "Who's in this room?" he exclaimed.
LINE 199: "Uncle Jui," he heard some one on the couch explain, laughing, "was
LINE 200: trying to take liberties with me!"
LINE 201: Chia Jui at one glance became aware that it was no other than Chia Jung;
LINE 202: and a sense of shame at once so overpowered him that he could find
LINE 203: nowhere to hide himself; nor did he know how best to extricate himself
LINE 204: from the dilemma. Turning himself round, he made an attempt to make good
LINE 205: his escape, when Chia Se with one grip clutched him in his hold.
LINE 206: "Don't run away," he said; "sister-in-law Lien has already reported your
LINE 207: conduct to madame Wang; and explained that you had tried to make her
LINE 208: carry on an improper flirtation with you; that she had temporised by
LINE 209: having recourse to a scheme to escape your importunities, and that she
LINE 210: had imposed upon you in such a way as to make you wait for her in this
LINE 211: place. Our lady was so terribly incensed, that she well-nigh succumbed;
LINE 212: and hence it is that she bade me come and catch you! Be quick now and
LINE 213: follow me, and let us go and see her."
LINE 214: After Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not be
LINE 215: contained within his body.
LINE 216: "My dear nephew," he entreated, "do tell her that it wasn't I; and I'll
LINE 217: show you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner."
LINE 218: "Letting you off," rejoined Chia Se, "is no difficult thing; but how
LINE 219: much, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter with
LINE 220: your lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better write
LINE 221: a promissory note."
LINE 222: "How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?" observed
LINE 223: Chia Jui.
LINE 224: "There's no difficulty about that either!" replied Chia Se; "just write
LINE 225: an account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside;
LINE 226: for payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a stated
LINE 227: number of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all that
LINE 228: is required."
LINE 229: "This is, in fact, easy enough!" Chia Jui having added by way of answer;
LINE 230: Chia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper and
LINE 231: pencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he bade
LINE 232: Chia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one
LINE 233: to do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but
LINE 234: (Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his
LINE 235: signature.
LINE 236: Chia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce Chia
LINE 237: Jung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate and
LINE 238: unwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; "To-morrow, I'll tell the
LINE 239: members of our clan to look into your nice conduct!"
LINE 240: These words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he even
LINE 241: went so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se was
LINE 242: trying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him a
LINE 243: good turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels,
LINE 244: before the matter was dropped.
LINE 245: Taking up again the thread of the conversation, Chia Se remarked, "Now
LINE 246: when I let you go, I'm quite ready to bear the blame! But the gate at
LINE 247: our old lady's over there is already bolted, and Mr. Chia Cheng is just
LINE 248: now engaged in the Hall, looking at the things which have arrived from
LINE 249: Nanking, so that it would certainly be difficult for you to pass through
LINE 250: that way. The only safe course at present is by the back gate; but if
LINE 251: you do go by there, and perchance meet any one, even I will be in for a
LINE 252: mess; so you might as well wait until I go first and have a peep, when
LINE 253: I'll come and fetch you! You couldn't anyhow conceal yourself in this
LINE 254: room; for in a short time they'll be coming to stow the things away, and
LINE 255: you had better let me find a safe place for you."
LINE 256: These words ended, he took hold of Chia Jui, and, extinguishing again
LINE 257: the lantern, he brought him out into the court, feeling his way up to
LINE 258: the bottom of the steps of the large terrace. "It's safe enough in this
LINE 259: nest," he observed, "but just squat down quietly and don't utter a
LINE 260: sound; wait until I come back before you venture out."
LINE 261: Having concluded this remark, the two of them (Chia Se and Chia Jung)
LINE 262: walked away; while Chia Jui was, all this time, out of his senses, and
LINE 263: felt constrained to remain squatting at the bottom of the terrace
LINE 264: stairs. He was about to consider what course was open for him to adopt,
LINE 265: when he heard a noise just over his head; and, with a splash, the
LINE 266: contents of a bucket, consisting entirely of filthy water, was emptied
LINE 267: straight down over him from above, drenching, as luck would have it, his
LINE 268: whole person and head.
LINE 269: Chia Jui could not suppress an exclamation. "Ai ya!" he cried, but he
LINE 270: hastily stopped his mouth with his hands, and did not venture to give
LINE 271: vent to another sound. His whole head and face were a mass of filth, and
LINE 272: his body felt icy cold. But as he shivered and shook, he espied Chia Se
LINE 273: come running. "Get off," he shouted, "with all speed! off with you at
LINE 274: once!"
LINE 275: As soon as Chia Jui returned to life again, he bolted with hasty
LINE 276: strides, out of the back gate, and ran the whole way home. The night had
LINE 277: already reached the third watch, so that he had to knock at the door for
LINE 278: it to be opened.
LINE 279: "What's the matter?" inquired the servants, when they saw him in this
LINE 280: sorry plight; (an inquiry) which placed him in the necessity of making
LINE 281: some false excuse. "The night was dark," he explained, "and my foot
LINE 282: slipped and I fell into a gutter."
LINE 283: Saying this, he betook himself speedily to his own apartment; and it was
LINE 284: only after he had changed his clothes and performed his ablutions, that
LINE 285: he began to realise that lady Feng had made a fool of him. He
LINE 286: consequently gave way to a fit of wrath; but upon recalling to mind the
LINE 287: charms of lady Feng's face, he felt again extremely aggrieved that he
LINE 288: could not there and then clasp her in his embrace, and as he indulged in
LINE 289: these wild thoughts and fanciful ideas, he could not the whole night
LINE 290: long close his eyes.
LINE 291: From this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng,
LINE 292: but he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion;
LINE 293: and with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him for
LINE 294: the money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather should
LINE 295: come to know everything.
LINE 296: His passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear,
LINE 297: and when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks,
LINE 298: which were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of about
LINE 299: twenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng,
LINE 300: which were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a great
LINE 301: extent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, what
LINE 302: is more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure much
LINE 303: hardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from all
LINE 304: sides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heart
LINE 305: inflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got as
LINE 306: soft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegar
LINE 307: in them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he was
LINE 308: repeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse,
LINE 309: while with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The whole
LINE 310: number of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of a
LINE 311: year, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strength
LINE 312: to bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes,
LINE 313: albeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams,
LINE 314: while his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject to
LINE 315: strange starts.
LINE 316: Every kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment had
LINE 317: recourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds,
LINE 318: turtle shell, ophiopogon, Yü-chü herb, and the like, he took several
LINE 319: tens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better;
LINE 320: so that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and
LINE 321: spring returned, this illness had become still more serious.
LINE 322: Tai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts to
LINE 323: attend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on,
LINE 324: he had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju could
LINE 325: not of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to the
LINE 326: Jung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Feng
LINE 327: to weigh two taels of it and give it to him. "The other day," rejoined
LINE 328: lady Feng, "not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for our
LINE 329: dowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole,
LINE 330: to present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as it
LINE 331: happens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them."
LINE 332: "If there's none over here in our place," suggested madame Wang, "just
LINE 333: send a servant to your mother-in-law's, on the other side, to inquire
LINE 334: whether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elder
LINE 335: brother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all you
LINE 336: get together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, and
LINE 337: got well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it will
LINE 338: really be to the benefit of you all."
LINE 339: Lady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to institute
LINE 340: any search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace,
LINE 341: she despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent by
LINE 342: madame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequently
LINE 343: reporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all there
LINE 344: was and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it to
LINE 345: them.
LINE 346: Chia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so that
LINE 347: there was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of money
LINE 348: was of no avail, for he derived no benefit.
LINE 349: On a certain day and at an unexpected moment, a lame Taoist priest came
LINE 350: to beg for alms, and he averred that he had the special gift of healing
LINE 351: diseases arising from grievances received, and as Chia Jui happened,
LINE 352: from inside, to hear what he said, he forthwith shouted out: "Go at
LINE 353: once, and bid that divine come in and save my life!" while he
LINE 354: reverentially knocked his head on the pillow.
LINE 355: The whole bevy of servants felt constrained to usher the Taoist in; and
LINE 356: Chia Jui, taking hold of him with a dash, "My Buddha!" he repeatedly
LINE 357: cried out, "save my life!"
LINE 358: The Taoist heaved a sigh. "This ailment of yours," he remarked, "is not
LINE 359: one that could be healed with any medicine; I have a precious thing here
LINE 360: which I'll give you, and if you gaze at it every day, your life can be
LINE 361: saved!"
LINE 362: When he had done talking, he produced from his pouch a looking-glass
LINE 363: which could reflect a person's face on the front and back as well. On
LINE 364: the upper part of the back were engraved the four characters: "Precious
LINE 365: Mirror of Voluptuousness." Handing it over to Chia Jui: "This object,"
LINE 366: he proceeded, "emanates from the primordial confines of the Great Void
LINE 367: and has been wrought by the Monitory Dream Fairy in the Palace of
LINE 368: Unreality and Spirituality, with the sole intent of healing the
LINE 369: illnesses which originate from evil thoughts and improper designs.
LINE 370: Possessing, as it does, the virtue of relieving mankind and preserving
LINE 371: life, I have consequently brought it along with me into the world, but I
LINE 372: only give it to those intelligent preëminent and refined princely men to
LINE 373: set their eyes on. On no account must you look at the front side; and
LINE 374: you should only gaze at the back of it; this is urgent, this is
LINE 375: expedient! After three days, I shall come and fetch it away; by which
LINE 376: time, I'm sure, it will have made him all right."
LINE 377: These words finished, he walked away with leisurely step, and though all
LINE 378: tried to detain him, they could not succeed.
LINE 379: Chia Jui received the mirror. "This Taoist," he thought, "would seem to
LINE 380: speak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?" At
LINE 381: the conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror of
LINE 382: Voluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but upon
LINE 383: perceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Jui
LINE 384: sustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with his
LINE 385: hands and in abusing the Taoist. "You good-for-nothing!" he exclaimed,
LINE 386: "why should you frighten me so? but I'll go further and look at the
LINE 387: front and see what it's like."
LINE 388: While he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face of
LINE 389: the mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding her
LINE 390: head and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself,
LINE 391: in a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where he
LINE 392: held an affectionate tête-à-tête with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted him
LINE 393: out again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of "Ai
LINE 394: yah!" and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; but
LINE 395: still, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part.
LINE 396: Chia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of a
LINE 397: tête-à-tête, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so that
LINE 398: he again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she still
LINE 399: waved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror,
LINE 400: he went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion,
LINE 401: when just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied two
LINE 402: persons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck,
LINE 403: and hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. "Let me take the mirror and I'll
LINE 404: come along." But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwith
LINE 405: beyond his power to say one word more. The servants, who stood by in
LINE 406: attendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand and
LINE 407: looking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes again
LINE 408: to pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at once
LINE 409: ceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what had
LINE 410: happened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of his
LINE 411: body was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With all
LINE 412: promptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to another
LINE 413: bed.
LINE 414: Tai-ju and his wife wept bitterly for him, to the utter disregard of
LINE 415: their own lives, while in violent terms they abused the Taoist priest.
LINE 416: "What kind of magical mirror is it?" they asked. "If we don't destroy
LINE 417: this glass, it will do harm to not a few men in the world!"
LINE 418: Having forthwith given directions to bring fire and burn it, a voice was
LINE 419: heard in the air to say, "Who told you to look into the face of it? You
LINE 420: yourselves have mistaken what is false for what is true, and why burn
LINE 421: this glass of mine?"
LINE 422: Suddenly the mirror was seen to fly away into the air; and when Tai-ju
LINE 423: went out of doors to see, he found no one else than the limping Taoist,
LINE 424: shouting, "Who is he who wishes to destroy the Mirror of
LINE 425: Voluptuousness?" While uttering these words, he snatched the glass, and,
LINE 426: as all eyes were fixed upon him, he moved away lissomely, as if swayed
LINE 427: by the wind.
LINE 428: Tai-ju at once made preparations for the funeral and went everywhere to
LINE 429: give notice that on the third day the obsequies would commence, that on
LINE 430: the seventh the procession would start to escort the coffin to the Iron
LINE 431: Fence Temple, and that on the subsequent day, it would be taken to his
LINE 432: original home.
LINE 433: Not much time elapsed before all the members of the Chia family came, in
LINE 434: a body, to express their condolences. Chia She, of the Jung Mansion,
LINE 435: presented twenty taels, and Chia Cheng also gave twenty taels. Of the
LINE 436: Ning Mansion, Chia Chen likewise contributed twenty taels. The remainder
LINE 437: of the members of the clan, of whom some were poor and some rich, and
LINE 438: not equally well off, gave either one or two taels, or three or four,
LINE 439: some more, some less. Among strangers, there were also contributions,
LINE 440: respectively presented by the families of his fellow-scholars,
LINE 441: amounting, likewise, collectively to twenty or thirty taels.
LINE 442: The private means of Tai-ju were, it is true, precarious, but with the
LINE 443: monetary assistance he obtained, he anyhow performed the funeral rites
LINE 444: with all splendour and éclat.
LINE 445: But who would have thought it, at the close of winter of this year, Lin
LINE 446: Ju-hai contracted a serious illness, and forwarded a letter, by some
LINE 447: one, with the express purpose of fetching Lin Tai-yü back. These
LINE 448: tidings, when they reached dowager lady Chia, naturally added to the
LINE 449: grief and distress (she already suffered), but she felt compelled to
LINE 450: make speedy preparations for Tai-yü's departure. Pao-yü too was
LINE 451: intensely cut up, but he had no alternative but to defer to the
LINE 452: affection of father and daughter; nor could he very well place any
LINE 453: hindrance in the way.
LINE 454: Old lady Chia, in due course, made up her mind that she would like Chia
LINE 455: Lien to accompany her, and she also asked him to bring her back again
LINE 456: along with him. But no minute particulars need be given of the manifold
LINE 457: local presents and of the preparations, which were, of course,
LINE 458: everything that could be wished for in excellence and perfectness.
LINE 459: Forthwith the day for starting was selected, and Chia Lien, along with
LINE 460: Lin Tai-yü, said good-bye to all the members of the family, and,
LINE 461: followed by their attendants, they went on board their boats, and set
LINE 462: out on their journey for Yang Chou.
LINE 463: But, Reader, should you have any wish to know fuller details, listen to
LINE 464: the account given in the subsequent Chapter.
