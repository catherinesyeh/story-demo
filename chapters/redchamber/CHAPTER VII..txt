LINE 2: Chia Lien disports himself with Hsi-feng.
LINE 3: Pao-yü meets Ch'in Chung at a family party.
LINE 4: To resume our narrative. Chou Jui's wife having seen old goody Liu off,
LINE 5: speedily came to report the visit to madame Wang; but, contrary to her
LINE 6: expectation, she did not find madame Wang in the drawing-room; and it
LINE 7: was after inquiring of the waiting-maids that she eventually learnt that
LINE 8: she had just gone over to have a chat with "aunt" Hsüeh. Mrs. Chou, upon
LINE 9: hearing this, hastily went out by the eastern corner door, and through
LINE 10: the yard on the east, into the Pear Fragrance Court.
LINE 11: As soon as she reached the entrance, she caught sight of madame Wang's
LINE 12: waiting-maid, Chin Ch'uan-erh, playing about on the terrace steps, with
LINE 13: a young girl, who had just let her hair grow. When they saw Chou Jui's
LINE 14: wife approach, they forthwith surmised that she must have some message
LINE 15: to deliver, so they pursed up their lips and directed her to the
LINE 16: inner-room. Chou Jui's wife gently raised the curtain-screen, and upon
LINE 17: entering discovered madame Wang, in voluble conversation with "aunt"
LINE 18: Hsüeh, about family questions and people in general.
LINE 19: Mrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into the
LINE 20: inner room, where she found Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai in a house dress, with her
LINE 21: hair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting on
LINE 22: the inner edge of the stove-couch, leaning on a small divan table, in
LINE 23: the act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid Ying
LINE 24: Erh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch'ai hastily put down her pencil, and
LINE 25: turning round with a face beaming with smiles, "Sister Chou," she said,
LINE 26: "take a seat."
LINE 27: Chou Jui's wife likewise promptly returned the smile.
LINE 28: "How is my young lady?" she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of the
LINE 29: couch. "I haven't seen you come over on the other side for two or three
LINE 30: days! Has Mr. Pao-yü perhaps given you offence?"
LINE 31: "What an idea!" exclaimed Pao Ch'ai, with a smile. "It's simply that
LINE 32: I've had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and that
LINE 33: I've in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself."
LINE 34: "Is that it?" asked Chou Jui's wife; "but after all, what rooted kind of
LINE 35: complaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time in
LINE 36: sending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make you
LINE 37: all right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeed
LINE 38: no trifle!"
LINE 39: Pao Ch'ai laughed when she heard these remarks.
LINE 40: "Pray," she said, "don't allude to this again; for this ailment of mine
LINE 41: I've seen, I can't tell you, how many doctors; taken no end of medicine
LINE 42: and spent I don't know how much money; but the more we did so, not the
LINE 43: least little bit of relief did I see. Lucky enough, we eventually came
LINE 44: across a bald-pated bonze, whose speciality was the cure of nameless
LINE 45: illnesses. We therefore sent for him to see me, and he said that I had
LINE 46: brought this along with me from the womb as a sort of inflammatory
LINE 47: virus, that luckily I had a constitution strong and hale so that it
LINE 48: didn't matter; and that it would be of no avail if I took pills or any
LINE 49: medicines. He then told me a prescription from abroad, and gave me also
LINE 50: a packet of a certain powder as a preparative, with a peculiar smell and
LINE 51: strange flavour. He advised me, whenever my complaint broke out, to take
LINE 52: a pill, which would be sure to put me right again. And this has, after
LINE 53: all, strange to say, done me a great deal of good."
LINE 54: "What kind of prescription is this one from abroad, I wonder," remarked
LINE 55: Mrs. Chou; "if you, miss, would only tell me, it would be worth our
LINE 56: while bearing it in mind, and recommending it to others: and if ever we
LINE 57: came across any one afflicted with this disease, we would also be doing
LINE 58: a charitable deed."
LINE 59: "You'd better not ask for the prescription," rejoined Pao Ch'ai smiling.
LINE 60: "Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries and
LINE 61: ingredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult to
LINE 62: find the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the white
LINE 63: peone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the white
LINE 64: summer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower,
LINE 65: and twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take the
LINE 66: four kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of the
LINE 67: vernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix them
LINE 68: with the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve mace
LINE 69: of water, fallen on 'rain water' day....."
LINE 70: "Good gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. "From all
LINE 71: you say, why you want three years' time! and what if no rain falls on
LINE 72: 'rain water' day! What would one then do?"
LINE 73: "Quite so!" Pao Ch'ai remarked smilingly; "how can there be such an
LINE 74: opportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing,
LINE 75: there's nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew,
LINE 76: collected on 'White Dew' day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost,
LINE 77: gathered on 'Frost Descent' day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on
LINE 78: 'Slight Snow' day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix them
LINE 79: with the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan.
LINE 80: You keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots of
LINE 81: some flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it and
LINE 82: take a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedar
LINE 83: decoction."
LINE 84: "O-mi-to-fu!" cried Mrs. Chou, when she heard all this, bursting out
LINE 85: laughing. "It's really enough to kill one! you might wait ten years and
LINE 86: find no such lucky moments!"
LINE 87: "Fortunate for me, however," pursued Pao Ch'ai, "in the course of a year
LINE 88: or two, after the bonze had told me about this prescription, we got all
LINE 89: the ingredients; and, after much trouble, we compounded a supply, which
LINE 90: we have now brought along with us from the south to the north; and lies
LINE 91: at present under the pear trees."
LINE 92: "Has this medicine any name or other of its own?" further inquired Mrs.
LINE 93: Chou.
LINE 94: "It has a name," replied Pao Ch'ai; "the mangy-headed bonze also told it
LINE 95: me; he called it 'cold fragrance' pill."
LINE 96: Chou Jui's wife nodded her head, as she heard these words. "What do you
LINE 97: feel like after all when this complaint manifests itself?" she went on
LINE 98: to ask.
LINE 99: "Nothing much," replied Pao Ch'ai; "I simply pant and cough a bit; but
LINE 100: after I've taken a pill, I get over it, and it's all gone."
LINE 101: Mrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang was
LINE 102: suddenly heard to enquire, "Who is in here?"
LINE 103: Mrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her all
LINE 104: about old goody Liu's visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing that
LINE 105: madame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when
LINE 106: "aunt" Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: "Wait a bit! I've something
LINE 107: to give you to take along with you."
LINE 108: And as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of the
LINE 109: screen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked the
LINE 110: waiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch'uan-erh. "Did my lady
LINE 111: call?" she asked.
LINE 112: "Bring that box of flowers," said Mrs. Hsueh.
LINE 113: Hsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a small
LINE 114: embroidered silk box.
LINE 115: "These," explained "aunt" Hsüeh, "are a new kind of flowers, made in the
LINE 116: palace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. I
LINE 117: thought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old,
LINE 118: if uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them in
LINE 119: their hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot all
LINE 120: about them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take them
LINE 121: with you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladies
LINE 122: in your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain give
LINE 123: a couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng."
LINE 124: "Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch'ai to wear,"
LINE 125: observed madame Wang, "and have done with it; why think of all the
LINE 126: others?"
LINE 127: "You don't know, sister," replied "aunt" Hsüeh, "what a crotchety thing
LINE 128: Pao Ch'ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder."
LINE 129: With these words on her lips, Chou Jui's wife took the box and walked
LINE 130: out of the door of the room. Perceiving that Chin Ch'uan-erh was still
LINE 131: sunning herself outside, Chou Jui's wife asked her: "Isn't this Hsiang
LINE 132: Ling, the waiting-maid that we've often heard of as having been
LINE 133: purchased just before the departure of the Hsüeh family for the capital,
LINE 134: and on whose account there occurred some case of manslaughter or other?"
LINE 135: "Of course it's she," replied Chin Ch'uan. But as they were talking,
LINE 136: they saw Hsiang Ling draw near smirkingly, and Chou Jui's wife at once
LINE 137: seized her by the hand, and after minutely scrutinizing her face for a
LINE 138: time, she turned round to Chin Ch'uan-erh and smiled. "With these
LINE 139: features she really resembles slightly the style of lady Jung of our
LINE 140: Eastern Mansion."
LINE 141: "So I too maintain!" said Chin Ch'uan-erh.
LINE 142: Chou Jui's wife then asked Hsiang Ling, "At what age did you enter this
LINE 143: family? and where are your father and mother at present?" and also
LINE 144: inquired, "In what year of your teens are you? and of what place are you
LINE 145: a native?"
LINE 146: But Hsiang Ling, after listening to all these questions, simply nodded
LINE 147: her head and replied, "I can't remember."
LINE 148: When Mrs. Chou and Chin Ch'uan-erh heard these words, their spirits
LINE 149: changed to grief, and for a while they felt affected and wounded at
LINE 150: heart; but in a short time, Mrs. Chou brought the flowers into the room
LINE 151: at the back of madame Wang's principal apartment.
LINE 152: The fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as her
LINE 153: granddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowd
LINE 154: them together in one place, that Pao-yü and Tai-yü should only remain
LINE 155: with her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch'un, T'an
LINE 156: Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, the three of them, should move on this side in the
LINE 157: three rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang's
LINE 158: quarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant and
LINE 159: to keep an eye over them.
LINE 160: Chou Jui's wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these rooms
LINE 161: as they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maids
LINE 162: assembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call.
LINE 163: Ying Ch'un's waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T'an Ch'un's
LINE 164: waiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made their
LINE 165: egress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui's
LINE 166: wife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together also
LINE 167: walked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch'un and T'an Ch'un
LINE 168: seated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presented
LINE 169: the flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were.
LINE 170: The girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey,
LINE 171: expressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put the
LINE 172: flowers away.
LINE 173: Mrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers);
LINE 174: "Miss Hsi Ch'un," she remarked, "is not at home; and possibly she's over
LINE 175: there with our old lady."
LINE 176: "She's in that room, isn't she?" inquired the waiting-maids.
LINE 177: Mrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, where
LINE 178: she found Hsi Ch'un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun of
LINE 179: the "moon reflected on water" convent, talking and laughing together. On
LINE 180: seeing Chou Jui's wife enter, Hsi Ch'un at once asked what she wanted,
LINE 181: whereupon Chou Jui's wife opened the box of flowers, and explained who
LINE 182: had sent them.
LINE 183: "I was just telling Chih Neng," remarked Hsi Ch'un laughing, "that I
LINE 184: also purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strange
LINE 185: enough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head,
LINE 186: where can I wear them?"
LINE 187: They were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and Hsi
LINE 188: Ch'un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.
LINE 189: "What time did you come over?" then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng.
LINE 190: "Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?"
LINE 191: "We came," explained Chih Neng, "as soon as it was day; after calling
LINE 192: upon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of
LINE 193: Mr. Yü, and told me to wait for her here."
LINE 194: "Have you received," further asked Mrs. Chou, "the monthly allowance for
LINE 195: incense offering due on the fifteenth or not?"
LINE 196: "I can't say," replied Chih Neng.
LINE 197: "Who's now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the
LINE 198: various temples?" interposed Hsi Ch'un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as
LINE 199: she heard what was said.
LINE 200: "It's Yü Hsin," replied Chou Jui's wife, "who's intrusted with the
LINE 201: charge."
LINE 202: "That's how it is," observed Hsi Ch'un with a chuckle; "soon after the
LINE 203: arrival of the Superior, Yü Hsin's wife came over and kept on whispering
LINE 204: with her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this
LINE 205: allowance."
LINE 206: Mrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after which
LINE 207: she came over to lady Feng's apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage,
LINE 208: she passed under Li Wan's back windows, and went along the wall
LINE 209: ornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western side
LINE 210: gate, she entered lady Feng's court, and walked over into the Entrance
LINE 211: Hall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on the
LINE 212: doorsteps of lady Feng's apartments.
LINE 213: When she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved her
LINE 214: hand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui's wife understood her
LINE 215: meaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, where
LINE 216: she saw a nurse patting lady Feng's daughter to sleep.
LINE 217: Mrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: "Is the young
LINE 218: lady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up."
LINE 219: The nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were being
LINE 220: made, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which lady
LINE 221: Feng's voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound of
LINE 222: a door opening, and out came P'ing Erh, with a large brass basin in her
LINE 223: hands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside.
LINE 224: P'ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceiving
LINE 225: Chou Jui's wife: "What have you come here again for, my old lady?" she
LINE 226: readily inquired.
LINE 227: Chou Jui's wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. "I've
LINE 228: come," said she, "to bring you a present of flowers."
LINE 229: Upon hearing this, P'ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs,
LINE 230: and, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she came
LINE 231: from the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first of
LINE 232: all Ts'ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on the
LINE 233: other side and present them to "madame" Jung, after which she asked Mrs.
LINE 234: Chou to express her thanks on her return.
LINE 235: Chou Jui's wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia's room on this
LINE 236: side of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall,
LINE 237: she casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in gala
LINE 238: dress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law.
LINE 239: "What are you running over here for at this time?" promptly inquired
LINE 240: Mrs. Chou.
LINE 241: "Have you been well of late, mother?" asked her daughter. "I've been
LINE 242: waiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What's there
LINE 243: so pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till I
LINE 244: was tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to our
LINE 245: venerable lady; I'm now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. What
LINE 246: errand haven't you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you're holding?"
LINE 247: "Ai! as luck would have it," rejoined Chou Jui's wife smilingly, "old
LINE 248: goody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and one
LINE 249: duties, I've had to run about here and there ever so long, and all for
LINE 250: her! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked me
LINE 251: to take these flowers to the young ladies, and I've been at it up to
LINE 252: this very moment, and haven't done yet! But coming at this time, you
LINE 253: must surely have something or other that you want me to do for you!
LINE 254: what's it?"
LINE 255: "Really ma, you're quick at guessing!" exclaimed her daughter with a
LINE 256: smile; "I'll tell you what it's all about. The day before yesterday,
LINE 257: your son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating with
LINE 258: some person or other; and some one, I don't know why, spread some evil
LINE 259: report, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a charge
LINE 260: against him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to his
LINE 261: native place. That's why I've come over to consult with you, as to whom
LINE 262: we should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of our
LINE 263: dilemma!"
LINE 264: "I knew at once," Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, "that there was
LINE 265: something wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and wait
LINE 266: for me and I'll come straightway, as soon as I've taken these flowers to
LINE 267: Miss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (to
LINE 268: attend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What's the use of so
LINE 269: much hurry!"
LINE 270: Her daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, when
LINE 271: she added as she walked away, "Mind, mother, and make haste."
LINE 272: "All right," replied Chou Jui's wife, "of course I will; you are young
LINE 273: yet, and without experience, and that's why you are in this flurry."
LINE 274: As she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-yü's apartments. Contrary to
LINE 275: her expectation Tai-yü was not at this time in her own room, but in
LINE 276: Pao-yü's; where they were amusing themselves in trying to solve the
LINE 277: "nine strung rings" puzzle. On entering Mrs. Chou put on a smile.
LINE 278: "'Aunt' Hsüeh," she explained, "has told me to bring these flowers and
LINE 279: present them to you to wear in your hair."
LINE 280: "What flowers?" exclaimed Pao-yü. "Bring them here and let me see them."
LINE 281: As he uttered these words, he readily stretched out his hands and took
LINE 282: them over, and upon opening the box and looking in, he discovered, in
LINE 283: fact, two twigs of a novel and artistic kind of artificial flowers, of
LINE 284: piled gauze, made in the palace.
LINE 285: Tai-yü merely cast a glance at them, as Pao-yü held them. "Have these
LINE 286: flowers," she inquired eagerly, "been sent to me alone, or have all the
LINE 287: other girls got some too?"
LINE 288: "Each one of the young ladies has the same," replied Mrs. Chou; "and
LINE 289: these two twigs are intended for you, miss."
LINE 290: Tai-yü forced a smile. "Oh! I see," she observed. "If all the others
LINE 291: hadn't chosen, even these which remain over wouldn't have been given to
LINE 292: me."
LINE 293: Chou Jui's wife did not utter a word in reply.
LINE 294: "Sister Chou, what took you over on the other side?" asked Pao-yü.
LINE 295: "I was told that our madame Wang was over there," explained Mrs. Chou,
LINE 296: "and as I went to give her a message, 'aunt' Hsüeh seized the
LINE 297: opportunity to ask me to bring over these flowers."
LINE 298: "What was cousin Pao Ch'ai doing at home?" asked Pao-yü. "How is it
LINE 299: she's not even been over for these few days?"
LINE 300: "She's not quite well," remarked Mrs. Chou.
LINE 301: When Pao-yü heard this news, "Who'll go," he speedily ascertained of the
LINE 302: waiting-maids, "and inquire after her? Tell her that cousin Lin and I
LINE 303: have sent round to ask how our aunt and cousin are getting on! ask her
LINE 304: what she's ailing from and what medicines she's taking, and explain to
LINE 305: her that I know I ought to have gone over myself, but that on my coming
LINE 306: back from school a short while back, I again got a slight chill; and
LINE 307: that I'll go in person another day."
LINE 308: While Pao-yü was yet speaking, Hsi Hsüeh volunteered to take the
LINE 309: message, and went off at once; and Mrs. Chou herself took her leave
LINE 310: without another word.
LINE 311: Mrs. Chou's son-in-law was, in fact, Leng Tzu-hsing, the intimate friend
LINE 312: of Yü-ts'un. Having recently become involved with some party in a
LINE 313: lawsuit, on account of the sale of some curios, he had expressly charged
LINE 314: his wife to come and sue for the favour (of a helping hand). Chou Jui's
LINE 315: wife, relying upon her master's prestige, did not so much as take the
LINE 316: affair to heart; and having waited till evening, she simply went over
LINE 317: and requested lady Feng to befriend her, and the matter was forthwith
LINE 318: ended.
LINE 319: When the lamps were lit, lady Feng came over, after having disrobed
LINE 320: herself, to see madame Wang. "I've already taken charge," she observed,
LINE 321: "of the things sent round to-day by the Chen family. As for the presents
LINE 322: from us to them, we should avail ourselves of the return of the boats,
LINE 323: by which the fresh delicacies for the new year were forwarded, to hand
LINE 324: them to them to carry back."
LINE 325: Madame Wang nodded her head in token of approval.
LINE 326: "The birthday presents," continued lady Feng, "for lady Ling Ngan, the
LINE 327: mother of the Earl of Ling Ngan, have already been got together, and
LINE 328: whom will you depute to take them over?"
LINE 329: "See," suggested madame Wang, "who has nothing to do; let four maids go
LINE 330: and all will be right! why come again and ask me?"
LINE 331: "Our eldest sister-in-law Chen," proceeded lady Feng, "came over to
LINE 332: invite me to go to-morrow to their place for a little change. I don't
LINE 333: think there will be anything for me to do to-morrow."
LINE 334: "Whether there be or not," replied madame Wang, "it doesn't matter; you
LINE 335: must go, for whenever she comes with an invitation, it includes us, who
LINE 336: are your seniors, so that, of course, it isn't such a pleasant thing for
LINE 337: you; but as she doesn't ask us this time, but only asks you, it's
LINE 338: evident that she's anxious that you should have a little distraction,
LINE 339: and you mustn't disappoint her good intention. Besides it's certainly
LINE 340: right that you should go over for a change."
LINE 341: Lady Feng assented, and presently Li Wan, Ying Ch'un and the other
LINE 342: cousins, likewise paid each her evening salutation and retired to their
LINE 343: respective rooms, where nothing of any notice transpired.
LINE 344: The next day lady Feng completed her toilette, and came over first to
LINE 345: tell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye to
LINE 346: dowager lady Chia; but when Pao-yü heard where she was going, he also
LINE 347: wished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to wait
LINE 348: until he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got into
LINE 349: a carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.
LINE 350: Mrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch'in, the wife of Mr. Chia
LINE 351: Jung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids,
LINE 352: waiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate to
LINE 353: receive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged,
LINE 354: as was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-yü by the
LINE 355: hand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch'in
LINE 356: handed tea round.
LINE 357: "What have you people invited me to come here for?" promptly asked lady
LINE 358: Feng; "if you have anything to present me with, hand it to me at once,
LINE 359: for I've other things to attend to."
LINE 360: Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Ch'in had barely any time to exchange any further
LINE 361: remarks, when several matrons interposed, smilingly: "Had our lady not
LINE 362: come to-day, there would have been no help for it, but having come, you
LINE 363: can't have it all your own way."
LINE 364: While they were conversing about one thing and another, they caught
LINE 365: sight of Chia Jung come in to pay his respects, which prompted Pao-yü to
LINE 366: inquire, "Isn't my elder brother at home to-day?"
LINE 367: "He's gone out of town to-day," replied Mrs. Yu, "to inquire after his
LINE 368: grandfather. You'll find sitting here," she continued, "very dull, and
LINE 369: why not go out and have a stroll?"
LINE 370: "A strange coincidence has taken place to-day," urged Mrs. Ch'in, with a
LINE 371: smile; "some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see my
LINE 372: brother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he's in
LINE 373: the library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?"
LINE 374: Pao-yü descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, when
LINE 375: Mrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. "Don't you let him
LINE 376: get into trouble," she enjoined. "It's a far different thing when he
LINE 377: comes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he's all right."
LINE 378: "If that be so," remarked lady Feng, "why not ask the young gentleman to
LINE 379: come in, and then I too can see him. There isn't, I hope, any objection
LINE 380: to my seeing him?"
LINE 381: "Never mind! never mind!" observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; "it's as well
LINE 382: that you shouldn't see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boys
LINE 383: of our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about.
LINE 384: Other people's children are brought up politely and properly, and not in
LINE 385: this vixenish style of yours. Why, you'd ridicule him to death!"
LINE 386: "I won't laugh at him then, that's all," smiled lady Feng; "tell them to
LINE 387: bring him in at once."
LINE 388: "He's shy," proceeded Mrs. Ch'in, "and has seen nothing much of the
LINE 389: world, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister."
LINE 390: "What an idea!" exclaimed lady Feng. "Were he even No Cha himself, I'd
LINE 391: like to see him; so don't talk trash; if, after all, you don't bring him
LINE 392: round at once, I'll give you a good slap on the mouth."
LINE 393: "I daren't be obstinate," answered Mrs. Ch'in smiling; "I'll bring him
LINE 394: round!"
LINE 395: In a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with
LINE 396: Pao-yü, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to
LINE 397: Pao-yü in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and
LINE 398: well-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful
LINE 399: appearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, like
LINE 400: a girl.
LINE 401: In a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after her
LINE 402: health.
LINE 403: Lady Feng was simply delighted with him. "You take a low seat next to
LINE 404: him!" she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-yü back. Then
LINE 405: readily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him to
LINE 406: take a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, his
LINE 407: studies and such matters, when she found that at school he went under
LINE 408: the name of Ch'in Chung.
LINE 409: The matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that this
LINE 410: was the first time their mistress met Ch'in Chung, (and knowing) that
LINE 411: she had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the other
LINE 412: side and told P'ing Erh about it.
LINE 413: P'ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Feng
LINE 414: and Mrs. Ch'in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting a
LINE 415: piece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that he
LINE 416: should attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handed
LINE 417: them to the servants who had come over, to take away.
LINE 418: Lady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far,
LINE 419: but Mrs. Ch'in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; and
LINE 420: in a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs.
LINE 421: Ch'in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; while
LINE 422: both Pao-yü and Ch'in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as they
LINE 423: pleased.
LINE 424: Since he had first glanced at Ch'in Chung, and seen what kind of person
LINE 425: he was, he felt at heart as if he had lost something, and after being
LINE 426: plunged in a dazed state for a time, he began again to give way to
LINE 427: foolish thoughts in his mind.
LINE 428: "There are then such beings as he in the world!" he reflected. "I now
LINE 429: see there are! I'm however no better than a wallowing pig or a mangy
LINE 430: cow! Despicable destiny! why was I ever born in this household of a
LINE 431: marquis and in the mansion of a duke? Had I seen the light in the home
LINE 432: of some penniless scholar, or poverty-stricken official, I could long
LINE 433: ago have enjoyed the communion of his friendship, and I would not have
LINE 434: lived my whole existence in vain! Though more honourable than he, it is
LINE 435: indeed evident that silk and satins only serve to swathe this rotten
LINE 436: trunk of mine, and choice wines and rich meats only to gorge the filthy
LINE 437: drain and miry sewer of this body of mine! Wealth! and splendour! ye are
LINE 438: no more than contaminated with pollution by me!"
LINE 439: Ever since Ch'in Chung had noticed Pao-yü's unusual appearance, his
LINE 440: sedate deportment, and what is more, his hat ornamented with gold, and
LINE 441: his dress full of embroidery, attended by beautiful maids and handsome
LINE 442: youths, he did not indeed think it a matter of surprise that every one
LINE 443: was fond of him.
LINE 444: "Born as I have had the misfortune to be," he went on to commune within
LINE 445: himself, "in an honest, though poor family, how can I presume to enjoy
LINE 446: his companionship! This is verily a proof of what a barrier poverty and
LINE 447: wealth set between man and man. What a serious misfortune is this too in
LINE 448: this mortal world!"
LINE 449: In wild and inane ideas of the same strain, indulged these two youths!
LINE 450: Pao-yü by and by further asked of him what books he was reading, and
LINE 451: Ch'in Chung, in answer to these inquiries, told him the truth. A few
LINE 452: more questions and answers followed; and after about ten remarks, a
LINE 453: greater intimacy sprang up between them.
LINE 454: Tea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having their
LINE 455: tea, Pao-yü suggested, "We two don't take any wine, and why shouldn't we
LINE 456: have our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there,
LINE 457: and thus save you all the trouble?"
LINE 458: The two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have their
LINE 459: tea; and Mrs. Ch'in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines for
LINE 460: lady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-yü: "Dear
LINE 461: uncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anything
LINE 462: disrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he's
LINE 463: naturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given to
LINE 464: having his own way."
LINE 465: "Off with you!" cried Pao-yü laughing; "I know it all." Mrs. Ch'in then
LINE 466: went on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came to
LINE 467: keep lady Feng company. Presently lady Feng and Mrs. Yu sent another
LINE 468: servant to tell Pao-yü that there was outside of everything they might
LINE 469: wish to eat and that they should mind and go and ask for it; and Pao-yü
LINE 470: simply signified that they would; but his mind was not set upon drinking
LINE 471: or eating; all he did was to keep making inquiries of Ch'in Chung about
LINE 472: recent family concerns.
LINE 473: Ch'in Chung went on to explain that his tutor had last year relinquished
LINE 474: his post, that his father was advanced in years and afflicted with
LINE 475: disease, and had multifarious public duties to preoccupy his mind, so
LINE 476: that he had as yet had no time to make arrangements for another tutor,
LINE 477: and that all he did was no more than to keep up his old tasks; that as
LINE 478: regards study, it was likewise necessary to have the company of one or
LINE 479: two intimate friends, as then only, by dint of a frequent exchange of
LINE 480: ideas and opinions, one could arrive at progress; and Pao-yü gave him no
LINE 481: time to complete, but eagerly urged, "Quite so! But in our household, we
LINE 482: have a family school, and those of our kindred who have no means
LINE 483: sufficient to engage the services of a tutor are at liberty to come over
LINE 484: for the sake of study, and the sons and brothers of our relatives are
LINE 485: likewise free to join the class. As my own tutor went home last year, I
LINE 486: am now also wasting my time doing nothing; my father's intention was
LINE 487: that I too should have gone over to this school, so that I might at
LINE 488: least temporarily keep up what I have already read, pending the arrival
LINE 489: of my tutor next year, when I could again very well resume my studies
LINE 490: alone at home. But my grandmother raised objections; maintaining first
LINE 491: of all, that the boys who attend the family classes being so numerous,
LINE 492: she feared we would be sure to be up to mischief, which wouldn't be at
LINE 493: all proper; and that, in the second place, as I had been ill for some
LINE 494: time, the matter should be dropped, for the present. But as, from what
LINE 495: you say, your worthy father is very much exercised on this score, you
LINE 496: should, on your return, tell him all about it, and come over to our
LINE 497: school. I'll also be there as your schoolmate; and as you and I will
LINE 498: reap mutual benefit from each other's companionship, won't it be nice!"
LINE 499: "When my father was at home the other day," Ch'in Chung smiled and said,
LINE 500: "he alluded to the question of a tutor, and explained that the free
LINE 501: schools were an excellent institution. He even meant to have come and
LINE 502: talked matters over with his son-in-law's father about my introduction,
LINE 503: but with the urgent concerns here, he didn't think it right for him to
LINE 504: come about this small thing, and make any trouble. But if you really
LINE 505: believe that I might be of use to you, in either grinding the ink, or
LINE 506: washing the slab, why shouldn't you at once make the needful
LINE 507: arrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as we
LINE 508: shall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set at
LINE 509: the same time our parents' minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure of
LINE 510: friendship, won't it be a profitable thing!"
LINE 511: "Compose your mind!" suggested Pao-yü. "We can by and by first of all,
LINE 512: tell your brother-in-law, and your sister as well as sister-in-law
LINE 513: Secunda Lien; and on your return home to-day, lose no time in explaining
LINE 514: all to your worthy father, and when I get back, I'll speak to my
LINE 515: grandmother; and I can't see why our wishes shouldn't speedily be
LINE 516: accomplished."
LINE 517: By the time they had arrived at this conclusion, the day was far
LINE 518: advanced, and the lights were about to be lit; and they came out and
LINE 519: watched them once more for a time as they played at dominoes. When they
LINE 520: came to settle their accounts Mrs. Ch'in and Mrs. Yu were again the
LINE 521: losers and had to bear the expense of a theatrical and dinner party; and
LINE 522: while deciding that they should enjoy this treat the day after the
LINE 523: morrow, they also had the evening repast.
LINE 524: Darkness having set in, Mrs. Yu gave orders that two youths should
LINE 525: accompany Mr. Ch'in home. The matrons went out to deliver the
LINE 526: directions, and after a somewhat long interval, Ch'in Chung said goodbye
LINE 527: and was about to start on his way.
LINE 528: "Whom have you told off to escort him?" asked Mrs. Yu.
LINE 529: "Chiao Ta," replied the matrons, "has been told to go, but it happens
LINE 530: that he's under the effects of drink and making free use again of
LINE 531: abusive language."
LINE 532: Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Chin remonstrated. "What's the use," they said, "of
LINE 533: asking him? that mean fellow shouldn't be chosen, but you will go again
LINE 534: and provoke him."
LINE 535: "People always maintain," added lady Feng, "that you are far too
LINE 536: lenient. But fancy allowing servants in this household to go on in this
LINE 537: way; why, what will be the end of it?"
LINE 538: "You don't mean to tell me," observed Mrs. Yu, "that you don't know this
LINE 539: Chiao Ta? Why, even the gentlemen one and all pay no heed to his doings!
LINE 540: your eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn't notice him. It's all
LINE 541: because when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or four
LINE 542: wars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from the
LINE 543: heap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. He
LINE 544: himself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they had
LINE 545: no water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it to
LINE 546: his master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumes
LINE 547: upon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When the
LINE 548: seniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him with
LINE 549: exceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him?
LINE 550: He is also advanced in years, and doesn't care about any decent manners;
LINE 551: his sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn't a single
LINE 552: person whom he won't abuse. I've again and again told the stewards not
LINE 553: to henceforward ask Chiao Ta to do any work whatever, but to treat him
LINE 554: as dead and gone; and here he's sent again to-day."
LINE 555: "How can I not know all about this Chiao Ta?" remarked lady Feng; "but
LINE 556: the secret of all this trouble is, that you won't take any decisive
LINE 557: step. Why not pack him off to some distant farm, and have done with
LINE 558: him?" And as she spoke, "Is our carriage ready?" she went on to inquire.
LINE 559: "All ready and waiting," interposed the married women.
LINE 560: Lady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-yü, they
LINE 561: walked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as the
LINE 562: entrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliant
LINE 563: light and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta,
LINE 564: however, availing himself of Chia Chen's absence from home, and elated
LINE 565: by wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice.
LINE 566: "You bully of the weak and coward with the strong," he cried, "when
LINE 567: there's any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it's
LINE 568: a question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, you
LINE 569: disorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forget
LINE 570: that if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good deal
LINE 571: higher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. Chiao
LINE 572: Ta wouldn't even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; not
LINE 573: to mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!"
LINE 574: While he went on cursing and railing with all his might, Chia Jung
LINE 575: appeared walking by lady Feng's carriage. All the servants having tried
LINE 576: to hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; and
LINE 577: forthwith blew him up for a time. "Let some one bind him up," he cried,
LINE 578: "and tomorrow, when he's over the wine, I'll call him to task, and we'll
LINE 579: see if he won't seek death."
LINE 580: Chiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, he
LINE 581: shouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: "Brother Jung," he
LINE 582: said, "don't put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak of
LINE 583: a man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn't presume
LINE 584: to display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and him
LINE 585: alone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Your
LINE 586: ancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all this
LINE 587: estate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for the
LINE 588: services I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master;
LINE 589: don't say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I'll
LINE 590: plunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red."
LINE 591: Lady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: "Don't you
LINE 592: yet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house,
LINE 593: won't he be a source of mischief? Besides, were relatives and friends to
LINE 594: hear about these things, won't they have a laugh at our expense, that a
LINE 595: household like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?"
LINE 596: Chia Jung assented. The whole band of servants finding that Chiao Ta was
LINE 597: getting too insolent had no help but to come up and throw him over, and
LINE 598: binding him up, they dragged him towards the stables. Chiao Ta abused
LINE 599: even Chia Chen with still more vehemence, and shouted in a boisterous
LINE 600: manner. "I want to go," he cried, "to the family Ancestral Temple and
LINE 601: mourn my old master. Who would have ever imagined that he would leave
LINE 602: behind such vile creatures of descendants as you all, day after day
LINE 603: indulging in obscene and incestuous practices, 'in scraping of the
LINE 604: ashes' and in philandering with brothers-in-law. I know all about your
LINE 605: doings; the best thing is to hide one's stump of an arm in one's
LINE 606: sleeve!" (wash one's dirty clothes at home).
LINE 607: The servants who stood by, upon hearing this wild talk, were quite at
LINE 608: their wits' end, and they at once seized him, tied him up, and filled
LINE 609: his mouth to the fullest extent with mud mixed with some horse refuse.
LINE 610: Lady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretended
LINE 611: not to hear; but Pao-yü, seated in the carriage as he was, also caught
LINE 612: this extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: "Sister, did you hear
LINE 613: him say something about 'scraping of the ashes?' What's it?"
LINE 614: "Don't talk such rubbish!" hastily shouted lady Feng; "it was the
LINE 615: maudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of your
LINE 616: listening, but you must also inquire! wait and I'll tell your mother and
LINE 617: we'll see if she doesn't seriously take you to task."
LINE 618: Pao-yü was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her to
LINE 619: forgive him. "My dear sister," he craved, "I won't venture again to say
LINE 620: anything of the kind"
LINE 621: "My dear brother, if that be so, it's all right!" rejoined lady Feng
LINE 622: reassuringly; "on our return we'll speak to her venerable ladyship and
LINE 623: ask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, and
LINE 624: invite Ch'in Chung to come to school for his studies."
LINE 625: While yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the Jung
LINE 626: Mansion.
LINE 627: Reader, do you wish to know what follows? if you do, the next chapter
LINE 628: will unfold it.
