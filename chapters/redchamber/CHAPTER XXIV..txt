LINE 1: The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for
LINE 2: generosity.
LINE 3: The foolish girl mislays her handkerchief and arouses mutual thoughts.
LINE 4: But to return to our narrative. Lin Tai-yü's sentimental reflections
LINE 5: were the while reeling and ravelling in an intricate maze, when
LINE 6: unexpectedly some one from behind gave her a tap, saying: "What are you
LINE 7: up to all alone here?" which took Lin Tai-yu so much by surprise that
LINE 8: she gave a start, and turning her head round to look and noticing that
LINE 9: it was Hsiang Ling and no one else; "You stupid girl!" Lin Tai-yü
LINE 10: replied, "you've given me such a fright! But where do you come from at
LINE 11: this time?"
LINE 12: Hsiang Ling giggled and smirked. "I've come," she added, "in search of
LINE 13: our young lady, but I can't find her anywhere. But your Tzu Chuan is
LINE 14: also looking after you; and she says that lady Secunda has sent a
LINE 15: present to you of some tea. But you had better go back home and sit
LINE 16: down."
LINE 17: As she spoke, she took Tai-yü by the hand, and they came along back to
LINE 18: the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan; where lady Feng had indeed sent her two small
LINE 19: catties of a new season tea, of superior quality. But Lin Tai-yü sat
LINE 20: down, in company with Hsiang Ling, and began to converse on the merits
LINE 21: of this tapestry and the fineness of that embroidery; and after they had
LINE 22: also had a game at chess, and read a few sentences out of a book, Hsiang
LINE 23: Ling took her departure. But we need not speak of either of them, but
LINE 24: return now to Pao-yü. Having been found, and brought back home, by Hsi
LINE 25: Jen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act of
LINE 26: examining Hsi Jen's needlework; but when she perceived Pao-yü arrive,
LINE 27: she forthwith remarked: "Where have you been? her venerable ladyship is
LINE 28: waiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our
LINE 29: Senior master, and don't you still make haste to go and change your
LINE 30: clothes and be off!"
LINE 31: Hsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-yü
LINE 32: sat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and,
LINE 33: while waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and
LINE 34: perceiving that Yüan Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a
LINE 35: green satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face
LINE 36: turned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the
LINE 37: criticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with
LINE 38: embroidery, Pao-yü readily pressed his face against the nape of her
LINE 39: neck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand
LINE 40: from stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below
LINE 41: that of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, "My dear girl," he said
LINE 42: smiling and with a drivelling face, "do let me lick the cosmetic off
LINE 43: your mouth!" clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like
LINE 44: twisted sweetmeat.
LINE 45: "Hsi Jen!" cried Yüan Yang at once, "come out and see! You've been with
LINE 46: him a whole lifetime, and don't you give him any advice; but let him
LINE 47: still behave in this fashion!" Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, clasping
LINE 48: the clothes, and turning to Pao-yü, she observed, "I advise you in this
LINE 49: way and it's no good, I advise you in that way and you don't mend; and
LINE 50: what do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, it
LINE 51: will then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in this
LINE 52: place!"
LINE 53: As she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clothes
LINE 54: on, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang,
LINE 55: to the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager lady
LINE 56: Chia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses were
LINE 57: all in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceived
LINE 58: Chia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as the
LINE 59: two of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries,
LINE 60: they saw some one come round from the side, and say: "My respects to
LINE 61: you, uncle Pao-yü!"
LINE 62: When Pao-yü came to look at him, he noticed that this person had an
LINE 63: oblong face, that his body was tall and lanky, that his age was only
LINE 64: eighteen or nineteen, and that he possessed, in real truth, an air of
LINE 65: refinement and elegance; but though his features were, after all,
LINE 66: exceedingly familiar, he could not recall to mind to what branch of the
LINE 67: family he belonged, and what his name was.
LINE 68: "What are you staring vacantly for?" Chia Lien inquired laughing.
LINE 69: "Don't you even recognise him? He's Yün Erh, the son of our fifth
LINE 70: sister-in-law, who lives in the back court!"
LINE 71: "Of course!" Pao-yü assented complacently. "How is it that I had
LINE 72: forgotten just now!" And having gone on to ask how his mother was, and
LINE 73: what work he had to do at present; "I've come in search of uncle
LINE 74: Secundus, to tell him something," Chia Yün replied, as he pointed at
LINE 75: Chia Lien.
LINE 76: "You've really improved vastly from what you were before," added Pao-yü
LINE 77: smiling; "you verily look just is if you were my son!"
LINE 78: "How very barefaced!" Chia Lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing;
LINE 79: "here's a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!"
LINE 80: "How far are you in your teens this year?" Pao-yü inquired with a smile.
LINE 81: "Eighteen!" Chia Yün rejoined.
LINE 82: This Chia Yün was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when he
LINE 83: heard Pao-yü remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave a
LINE 84: sarcastic smile and observed, "The proverb is true which says, 'the
LINE 85: grandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on a
LINE 86: staff.' But though old enough in years, I'm nevertheless like a
LINE 87: mountain, which, in spite of its height, cannot screen the sun from
LINE 88: view. Besides, since my father's death, I've had no one to look after
LINE 89: me, and were you, uncle Pao, not to disdain your doltish nephew, and to
LINE 90: acknowledge me as your son, it would be your nephew's good fortune!"
LINE 91: "Have you heard what he said?" Chia Lien interposed cynically. "But to
LINE 92: acknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!" and with these
LINE 93: words, he walked in; whereupon Pao-yü smilingly said: "To-morrow when
LINE 94: you have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don't go and play
LINE 95: any devilish pranks with them! I've just now no leisure, so come
LINE 96: to-morrow, into the library, where I'll have a chat with you for a whole
LINE 97: day, and take you into the garden for some fun!"
LINE 98: With this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and
LINE 99: mounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed
LINE 100: over to Chia She's on this side; where having discovered that Chia She
LINE 101: had nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly
LINE 102: contracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia's message, and
LINE 103: next paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and made
LINE 104: suitable answer to her venerable ladyship's inquiries, and then calling
LINE 105: a servant, "Take the gentleman," he said, "into my lady's apartment to
LINE 106: sit down."
LINE 107: Pao-yü withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upper
LINE 108: apartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, before
LINE 109: everything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia's
LINE 110: health; after which, Pao-yü made his own salutation, and madame Hsing
LINE 111: drew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat,
LINE 112: and eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders to
LINE 113: serve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived Chia
LINE 114: Tsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-yü.
LINE 115: "Where could one find such a living monkey as this!" madame Hsing
LINE 116: remarked; "is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn't even
LINE 117: keep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with those
LINE 118: eyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely look
LINE 119: like the child of a great family of scholars."
LINE 120: While she spoke, she perceived both Chia Huan and Chia Lan, one of whom
LINE 121: was a young uncle and the other his nephew, also advance and present
LINE 122: their compliments, and madame Hsing bade the two of them sit down on the
LINE 123: chairs. But when Chia Huan noticed that Pao-yü sat on the same rug with
LINE 124: madame Hsing, and that her ladyship was further caressing and petting
LINE 125: him in every possible manner, he soon felt so very unhappy at heart,
LINE 126: that, after sitting for a short time, he forthwith made a sign to Chia
LINE 127: Lan that he would like to go; and as Chia Lan could not but humour him,
LINE 128: they both got up together to take their leave. But when Pao-yü perceived
LINE 129: them rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madame
LINE 130: Hsing remarked smilingly, "You had better sit a while as I've something
LINE 131: more to tell you," so that Pao-yü had no alternative but to stay. "When
LINE 132: you get back," madame Hsing added, addressing the other two, "present,
LINE 133: each one of you, my regards to your respective mothers. The young
LINE 134: ladies, your cousins, are all here making such a row that my head is
LINE 135: dazed, so that I won't to-day keep you to have your repast here." To
LINE 136: which Chia Huan and Chia Lan assented and quickly walked out.
LINE 137: "If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over," Pao-yü
LINE 138: ventured with a smirk, "how is it that I don't see them?"
LINE 139: "After sitting here for a while," madame Hsing explained, "they all went
LINE 140: at the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don't know."
LINE 141: "My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-yü observed;
LINE 142: what's it, I wonder?"
LINE 143: "What can there possibly be to tell you?" madame Hsing laughed; "it was
LINE 144: simply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies and
LINE 145: then go; but there's also a fine plaything that I'll give you to take
LINE 146: back to amuse yourself with."
LINE 147: These two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquy
LINE 148: when, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the young
LINE 149: ladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in their
LINE 150: places, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and,
LINE 151: after the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal,
LINE 152: Pao-yü bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with all
LINE 153: the young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager lady
LINE 154: Chia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their rooms
LINE 155: and retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any further
LINE 156: comment and speak of Chia Yün's visit to the mansion. As soon as he saw
LINE 157: Chia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia
LINE 158: Lien consequently explained: "The other day something did actually
LINE 159: present itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again
LINE 160: entreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch'in; as she promised me that there
LINE 161: would be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and
LINE 162: trees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, for
LINE 163: a certainty, give it to you and finish!"
LINE 164: Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; "If
LINE 165: that be so, there's nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, you
LINE 166: too mustn't make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to my
LINE 167: having come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ample
LINE 168: time to speak to her when the job turns up!"
LINE 169: "Why should I allude to it?" Chia Lien rejoined. "Have I forsooth got
LINE 170: all this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides,
LINE 171: I've got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it's absolutely
LINE 172: necessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day; so off
LINE 173: with you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after the
LINE 174: watch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour,
LINE 175: I shan't have any leisure!" With these words, he hastily went at the
LINE 176: back to change his clothes. And from the time Chia Yun put his foot out
LINE 177: of the door of the Jung Kuo mansion, he was, the whole way homeward,
LINE 178: plunged in deep thought; but having bethought himself of some expedient,
LINE 179: he straightway wended his steps towards the house of his maternal uncle,
LINE 180: Pu Shih-jen. This Pu Shih-jen, it must be explained, kept, at the
LINE 181: present date, a shop for the sale of spices. He had just returned home
LINE 182: from his shop, and as soon as he noticed Chia Yun, he inquired of him
LINE 183: what business brought him there.
LINE 184: "There's something," Chia Yun replied, "in which I would like to crave
LINE 185: your assistance, uncle; I'm in need of some baroos camphor and musk, so
LINE 186: please, uncle, give me on credit four ounces of each kind, and on the
LINE 187: festival of the eighth moon, I'll bring you the amount in full."
LINE 188: Pu Shih-jen gave a sardonic smile. "Don't," he said, "again allude to
LINE 189: any such thing as selling on tick! Some time back a partner in our
LINE 190: establishment got several ounces of goods for his relatives on credit,
LINE 191: and up to this date the bill hasn't as yet been settled; the result
LINE 192: being that we've all had to make the amount good, so that we've entered
LINE 193: into an agreement that we should no more allow any one to obtain on tick
LINE 194: anything on behalf of either relative or friend, and that whoever acted
LINE 195: contrary to this resolution should be, at once, fined twenty taels, with
LINE 196: which to stand a treat. Besides, the stock of these articles is now
LINE 197: short, and were you also to come, with ready money to this our mean shop
LINE 198: to buy any, we wouldn't even have as much to give you. The best way
LINE 199: therefore is for you to go elsewhere. This is one side of the question;
LINE 200: for on the other, you can't have anything above-board in view; and were
LINE 201: you to obtain what you want as a loan you would again go and play the
LINE 202: giddy dog! But you'll simply say that on every occasion your uncle sees
LINE 203: you, he avails himself of it to find fault with you, but a young fellow
LINE 204: like you doesn't know what's good and what is bad; and you should,
LINE 205: besides, make up your mind to earn a few cash, wherewith to clothe and
LINE 206: feed yourself, so that, when I see you, I too may rejoice!"
LINE 207: "What you, uncle, say," Chia Yun rejoined smiling, "is perfectly right;
LINE 208: the only thing is that at the time of my father's death, I was likewise
LINE 209: so young in years that I couldn't understand anything; but later on, I
LINE 210: heard my mother explain how that for everything, it was lucky that you,
LINE 211: after all, my uncles, went over to our house and devised the ways and
LINE 212: means, and managed the funeral; and is it likely you, uncle, aren't
LINE 213: aware of these things? Besides, have I forsooth had a single acre of
LINE 214: land or a couple of houses, the value of which I've run through as soon
LINE 215: as it came into my hands? An ingenious wife cannot make boiled rice
LINE 216: without raw rice; and what would you have me do? It's your good fortune
LINE 217: however that you've got to deal with one such as I am, for had it been
LINE 218: any one else barefaced and shameless, he would have come, twice every
LINE 219: three days, to worry you, uncle, by asking for two pints of rice and two
LINE 220: of beans, and you then, uncle, would have had no help for it."
LINE 221: "My dear child," Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, "had I anything that I could
LINE 222: call my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn't I feel bound to do something
LINE 223: for you? I've day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortune
LINE 224: was that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making up
LINE 225: your mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and when
LINE 226: the gentlemen aren't looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnob
LINE 227: with those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, even
LINE 228: through them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when I
LINE 229: was out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch of
LINE 230: the family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or five
LINE 231: carriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priests
LINE 232: on their way to the family fane, and that man can't lack brains, for
LINE 233: such a charge to have fallen to his share!"
LINE 234: Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revolting
LINE 235: rigmarole, and then got up to take his leave.
LINE 236: "What are you in such a hurry for?" Pu Shih-jen remarked. "Have your
LINE 237: meal and then go!"
LINE 238: But this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: "Are
LINE 239: you again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I bought
LINE 240: half a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; and
LINE 241: do you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep your
LINE 242: nephew to feel the pangs of hunger?"
LINE 243: "Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that's
LINE 244: all," Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to her
LINE 245: daughter, Yin Chieh, "Go over to Mrs. Wang's opposite, and ask her if
LINE 246: she has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow,
LINE 247: when they're brought over, we'll repay her."
LINE 248: But while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, Chia
LINE 249: Yün had, at an early period, repeated several times: "There's no need to
LINE 250: go to this trouble," and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind.
LINE 251: But without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of the
LINE 252: Pu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Yün. Having gone in
LINE 253: high dudgeon out of the door of his uncle's house, he started straight
LINE 254: on his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied with
LINE 255: his thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came into
LINE 256: collision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Yün, and began to
LINE 257: abuse him, crying: "Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang against
LINE 258: me?"
LINE 259: The tone of voice, when it reached Chia Yün ears, sounded like that of
LINE 260: some one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found,
LINE 261: in fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was a
LINE 262: dissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates of
LINE 263: interest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delight
LINE 264: was to drink and to fight.
LINE 265: He was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of a
LINE 266: creditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, so
LINE 267: that when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Yün ran against him, he meant
LINE 268: there and then to start a scuffle with him.
LINE 269: "Old Erh!" Chia Yün shouted, "stay your hand; it's I who have hustled
LINE 270: against you."
LINE 271: As soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide his
LINE 272: drunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Yün, he
LINE 273: hastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggered
LINE 274: about, "Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off to
LINE 275: now?"
LINE 276: "I couldn't tell you!" Chia Yün rejoined; "I've again brought
LINE 277: displeasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine."
LINE 278: "Never mind!" urged Ni Erh, "if you're in any trouble you just tell me,
LINE 279: and I'll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets,
LINE 280: and six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine,
LINE 281: of me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I'll wager that I compel that
LINE 282: man's family to disperse, and his home to break up!"
LINE 283: "Old Ni, don't lose your temper," Chia Yün protested, "but listen and
LINE 284: let me tell you what happened!" After which, he went on to tell Ni Erh
LINE 285: the whole affair with Pu Shih-jen. As soon as Ni Erh heard him, he got
LINE 286: into a frightful rage; "Were he not," he shouted, a "relative of yours,
LINE 287: master Secundus, I would readily give him a bit of my mind! Really
LINE 288: resentment will stifle my breath! but never mind! you needn't however
LINE 289: distress yourself. I've got here a few taels ready at hand, which, if
LINE 290: you require, don't scruple to take; and from such good neighbours as you
LINE 291: are, I won't ask any interest upon this money."
LINE 292: With this remark still on his lips, he produced from his pouch a bundle
LINE 293: of silver.
LINE 294: "Ni Erh has, it is true, ever been a rogue," Chia Yün reflected in his
LINE 295: own mind, "but as he is regulated in his dealings by a due regard to
LINE 296: persons, he enjoys, to a great degree, the reputation of generosity; and
LINE 297: were I to-day not to accept this favour of his, he'll, I fear, be put to
LINE 298: shame; and it won't contrariwise be nice on my part! and isn't it better
LINE 299: that I should make use of his money, and by and by I can repay him
LINE 300: double, and things will be all right!"
LINE 301: "Old Erh," he therefore observed aloud with a smile, "you're really a
LINE 302: fine fellow, and as you've shown me such eminent consideration, how can
LINE 303: I presume not to accept your offer! On my return home, I'll write the
LINE 304: customary I.O.U., and send it to you, and all will be in order."
LINE 305: Ni Erh gave a broad grin. "It's only fifteen taels and three mace," he
LINE 306: answered, "and if you insist upon writing an I.O.U., I won't then lend
LINE 307: it to you!"
LINE 308: Chia Yün at these words, took over the money, smiling the while. "I'll
LINE 309: readily," he retorted, "comply with your wishes and have done; for
LINE 310: what's the use of exasperating you!"
LINE 311: "Well then that will be all right!" Ni Erh laughed; "but the day is
LINE 312: getting dark; and I shan't ask you to have a cup of tea or stand you a
LINE 313: drink, for I've some small things more to settle. As for me, I'm going
LINE 314: over there, but you, after all, should please wend your way homewards;
LINE 315: and I shall also request you to take a message for me to my people. Tell
LINE 316: them to close the doors and turn in, as I'm not returning home; and that
LINE 317: in the event of anything occurring, to bid our daughter come over
LINE 318: to-morrow, as soon as it is daylight, to short-legged Wang's house, the
LINE 319: horse-dealer's, in search of me!" And as he uttered this remark he
LINE 320: walked away, stumbling and hobbling along. But we will leave him without
LINE 321: further notice and allude to Chia Yün.
LINE 322: He had, at quite an unexpected juncture, met this piece of luck, so that
LINE 323: his heart was, of course, delighted to the utmost degree. "This Ni Erh,"
LINE 324: he mused, "is really a good enough sort of fellow, but what I dread is
LINE 325: that he may have been open-handed in his fit of drunkenness, and that he
LINE 326: mayn't, by and by, ask for his money to be paid twice over; and what
LINE 327: will I do then? Never mind," he suddenly went on to ponder, "when that
LINE 328: job has become an accomplished fact, I shall even have the means to pay
LINE 329: him back double the original amount."
LINE 330: Prompted by this resolution, he came over to a money-shop, and when he
LINE 331: had the silver weighed, and no discrepancy was discovered in the weight,
LINE 332: he was still more elated at heart; and on his way back, he first and
LINE 333: foremost delivered Ni Erh's message to his wife, and then returned to
LINE 334: his own home, where he found his mother seated all alone on a
LINE 335: stove-couch spinning thread. As soon as she saw him enter, she inquired
LINE 336: where he had been the whole day long, in reply to which Chia Yün,
LINE 337: fearing lest his parent should be angry, forthwith made no allusion to
LINE 338: what transpired with Pu Shih-jen, but simply explained that he had been
LINE 339: in the western mansion, waiting for his uncle Secundus, Lien. This over,
LINE 340: he asked his mother whether she had had her meal or not, and his parent
LINE 341: said by way of reply: "I've had it, but I've kept something for you in
LINE 342: there," and calling to the servant-maid, she bade her bring it round,
LINE 343: and set it before him to eat. But as it was already dark, when the lamps
LINE 344: had to be lit, Chia Yün, after partaking of his meal, got ready and
LINE 345: turned in.
LINE 346: Nothing of any notice transpired the whole night; but the next day, as
LINE 347: soon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the main
LINE 348: street, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from a
LINE 349: perfumery shop, he, with rapid stride, entered the Jung Kuo mansion; and
LINE 350: having, as a result of his inquiries, found out that Chia Lien had gone
LINE 351: out of doors, Chia Yün readily betook himself to the back, in front of
LINE 352: the door of Chia Lien's court, where he saw several servant-lads, with
LINE 353: immense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping the
LINE 354: court. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui's wife appear outside
LINE 355: the door, and call out to the young boys; "Don't sweep now, our lady is
LINE 356: coming out," Chia Yün eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a face
LINE 357: beaming with smiles: "Where's aunt Secunda going to?"
LINE 358: To this inquiry, Chou Jui's wife explained: "Our old lady has sent for
LINE 359: her, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth or
LINE 360: other." But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people,
LINE 361: pressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment.
LINE 362: Chia Yün was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery,
LINE 363: and delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with all
LINE 364: reverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But lady
LINE 365: Feng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; but
LINE 366: continued, as hitherto, her way onwards, simply confining herself to
LINE 367: ascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: "How is it
LINE 368: that she doesn't come to our house for a stroll?"
LINE 369: "The thing is," Chia Yün replied, "that she's not well: she, however,
LINE 370: often thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as for
LINE 371: coming round, she's quite unable to do so."
LINE 372: "You have, indeed, the knack of telling lies!" lady Feng laughed with
LINE 373: irony; "for hadn't I alluded to her, she would never have thought of
LINE 374: me!"
LINE 375: "Isn't your nephew afraid," Chia Yün protested smilingly, "of being
LINE 376: blasted by lightning to have the audacity of telling lies in the
LINE 377: presence of an elder! Even so late as yesterday evening, she alluded to
LINE 378: you, aunt! 'Though naturally,' she said, 'of a weak constitution, you
LINE 379: had, however, plenty to attend to! that it's thanks to your supremely
LINE 380: eminent energies, aunt, that you're, after all, able to manage
LINE 381: everything in such a perfect manner; and that had you ever made the
LINE 382: slightest slip, there would have long ago crept up, goodness knows, what
LINE 383: troubles!'"
LINE 384: As soon as lady Feng heard these words, her whole face beamed with
LINE 385: smiles, and she unconsciously halted her steps, while she proceeded to
LINE 386: ask: "How is it that, both your mother and yourself, tattle about me
LINE 387: behind my back, without rhyme or reason?"
LINE 388: "There's a reason for it," Chia Yün observed, "which is simply this.
LINE 389: I've an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, who
LINE 390: recently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, the
LINE 391: rank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a post
LINE 392: in Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he has
LINE 393: gone together with his family. He even closed this shop of his, and
LINE 394: forthwith collecting all his wares, he gave away, what he could give
LINE 395: away, and what he had to sell at a discount, was sold at a loss; while
LINE 396: such valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives or
LINE 397: friends; and that's why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor and
LINE 398: musk. But I at the time, deliberated with my mother that to sell them
LINE 399: below their price would be a pity, and that if we wished to give them as
LINE 400: a present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes.
LINE 401: But remembering how you, aunt, had all along in years gone by, even to
LINE 402: this day, to spend large bundles of silver, in purchasing such articles,
LINE 403: and how, not to speak of this year with an imperial consort in the
LINE 404: Palace, what's even required for this dragon boat festival, will also
LINE 405: necessitate the addition of hundred times as much as the quantity of
LINE 406: previous years, I therefore present them to you, aunt, as a token of my
LINE 407: esteem!"
LINE 408: With these words still on his lips, he simultaneously produced an
LINE 409: ornamented box, which he handed over to her. And as lady Feng was, at
LINE 410: this time, making preparations for presents for the occasion of the
LINE 411: dragon boat festival, for which perfumes were obligatory, she, with all
LINE 412: promptitude, directed Feng Erh: "Receive Mr. Yün's present and take it
LINE 413: home and hand it over to P'ing Erh. To one," she consequently added,
LINE 414: "who seems to me so full of discrimination, it isn't a wonder that your
LINE 415: uncle is repeatedly alluding, and that he speaks highly of you; how that
LINE 416: you talk with all intelligence and that you have experience stored up in
LINE 417: your mind."
LINE 418: Chia Yün upon hearing this propitious language, hastily drew near one
LINE 419: step, and designedly asked: "Does really uncle often refer to me?"
LINE 420: The moment lady Feng caught this question, she was at once inclined to
LINE 421: tell him all about the charge to be entrusted to him, but on second
LINE 422: thought, she again felt apprehensive lest she should be looked lightly
LINE 423: upon by him, by simply insinuating that she had promptly and needlessly
LINE 424: promised him something to do, so soon as she got a little scented ware;
LINE 425: and this consideration urged her to once more restrain her tongue, so
LINE 426: that she never made the slightest reference even to so much as one word
LINE 427: about his having been chosen to look after the works of planting the
LINE 428: flowers and trees. And after confining herself to making the first few
LINE 429: irrelevant remarks which came to her lips, she hastily betook herself
LINE 430: into dowager lady Chia's apartments.
LINE 431: Chia Yün himself did not feel as if he could very well advert to the
LINE 432: subject, with the result that he had no alternative but to retrace his
LINE 433: steps homewards. But as when he had seen Pao-yü the previous day, he had
LINE 434: asked him to go into the outer library and wait for him, he therefore
LINE 435: finished his meal and then once again entered the mansion and came over
LINE 436: into the I Hsia study, situated outside the ceremonial gate, over at old
LINE 437: lady Chia's part of the compound, where he discovered the two lads Ming
LINE 438: Yen, whose name had been changed into Pei Ming, and Chu Yo playing at
LINE 439: chess, and just arguing about the capture of a castle; and besides them,
LINE 440: Yin Ch'uan, Sao Hua, T'iao Yün, Pan Ho, these four or five of them, up
LINE 441: to larks, stealing the young birds from the nests under the eaves of the
LINE 442: house.
LINE 443: As soon as Chia Yün entered the court, he stamped his foot and shouted,
LINE 444: "The monkeys are up to mischief! Here I am, I've come;" and when the
LINE 445: company of servant-boys perceived him, they one and all promptly
LINE 446: dispersed; while Chia Yün walked into the library, and seating himself
LINE 447: at once in a chair, he inquired, "Has your master Secundus, Mr. Pao,
LINE 448: come down?"
LINE 449: "He hasn't been down here at all to-day," Pei Ming replied, "but if you,
LINE 450: Mr. Secundus, have anything to tell him, I'll go and see what he's up to
LINE 451: for you."
LINE 452: Saying this he there and then left the room; and Chia Yün meanwhile gave
LINE 453: himself to the inspection of the pictures and nicknacks. But some
LINE 454: considerable time elapsed, and yet he did not see him arrive; and
LINE 455: noticing besides that the other lads had all gone to romp, he was just
LINE 456: plunged in a state of despondency, when he heard outside the door a
LINE 457: voice cry out, with winning tone, and tender accents: "My elder
LINE 458: brother!"
LINE 459: Chia Yün looked out, and saw that it was a servant-maid of fifteen or
LINE 460: sixteen, who was indeed extremely winsome and spruce. As soon however as
LINE 461: the maid caught a glimpse of Chia Yün, she speedily turned herself round
LINE 462: and withdrew out of sight. But, as luck would have it, it happened that
LINE 463: Pei Ming was coming along, and seeing the servant-maid in front of the
LINE 464: door, he observed: "Welcome, welcome! I was quite at a loss how to get
LINE 465: any news of Pao-yü." And as Chia Yün discerned Pei Ming, he hastily too,
LINE 466: ran out in pursuit of him, and ascertained what was up; whereupon Pei
LINE 467: Ming returned for answer: "I waited a whole day long, and not a single
LINE 468: soul came over; but this girl is attached to master Secundus' (Mr.
LINE 469: Pao's) rooms!" and, "My dear girl," he consequently went on to say, "go
LINE 470: in and take a message. Say that Mr. Secundus, who lives under the
LINE 471: portico, has come!"
LINE 472: The servant-maid, upon hearing these words, knew at once that he was a
LINE 473: young gentleman belonging to the family in which she served, and she did
LINE 474: not skulk out of sight, as she had done in the first instance; but with
LINE 475: a gaze sufficient to kill, she fixed her two eyes upon Chia Yün, when
LINE 476: she heard Chia Yün interpose: "What about over the portico and under the
LINE 477: portico; you just tell him that Yün Erh is come, that's all."
LINE 478: After a while this girl gave a sarcastic smile. "My idea is," she
LINE 479: ventured, "that you, master Secundus, should really, if it so please
LINE 480: you, go back, and come again to-morrow; and to-night, if I find time,
LINE 481: I'll just put in a word with him!"
LINE 482: "What's this that you're driving at?" Pei Ming then shouted.
LINE 483: And the maid rejoined: "He's not even had a siesta to-day, so that he'll
LINE 484: have his dinner at an early hour, and won't come down again in the
LINE 485: evening; and is it likely that you would have master Secundus wait here
LINE 486: and suffer hunger? and isn't it better than he should return home? The
LINE 487: right thing is that he should come to-morrow; for were even by and by
LINE 488: some one to turn up, who could take a message, that person would simply
LINE 489: acquiesce with the lips, but would he be willing to deliver the message
LINE 490: in for you?"
LINE 491: Chia Yün, upon finding how concise and yet how well expressed this
LINE 492: girl's remarks had been, was bent upon inquiring what her name was; but
LINE 493: as she was a maid employed in Pao-yü's apartments, he did not therefore
LINE 494: feel justified in asking the question, and he had no other course but to
LINE 495: add, "What you say is quite right, I'll come to-morrow!" and as he
LINE 496: spoke, he there and then was making his way outside, when Pei Ming
LINE 497: remarked: "I'll go and pour a cup of tea; and master Secundus, have your
LINE 498: tea and then go."
LINE 499: Chia Yün turned his head round, as he kept on his way, and said by way
LINE 500: of rejoinder: "I won't have any tea; for I've besides something more to
LINE 501: attend to!" and while with his lips he uttered these words, he, with his
LINE 502: eyes, stared at the servant-girl, who was still standing in there.
LINE 503: Chia Yün wended his steps straightway home; and the next day, he came to
LINE 504: the front entrance, where, by a strange coincidence, he met lady Feng on
LINE 505: her way to the opposite side to pay her respects. She had just mounted
LINE 506: her carriage, but perceiving Chia Yün arrive, she eagerly bade a servant
LINE 507: stop him, and, with the window between them, she smiled and observed:
LINE 508: "Yün Erh, you're indeed bold in playing your pranks with me! I thought
LINE 509: it strange that you should give me presents; but the fact is you had a
LINE 510: favour to ask of me; and your uncle told me even yesterday that you had
LINE 511: appealed to him!"
LINE 512: Chia Yün smiled. "Of my appeal to uncle, you needn't, aunt, make any
LINE 513: mention; for I'm at this moment full of regret at having made it. Had I
LINE 514: known, at an early hour, that things would have come to this pass, I
LINE 515: would, from the very first, have made my request to you, aunt; and by
LINE 516: this time everything would have been settled long ago! But who would
LINE 517: have anticipated that uncle was, after all, a man of no worth!"
LINE 518: "Strange enough," lady Feng remarked sneeringly, "when you found that
LINE 519: you didn't succeed in that quarter, you came again yesterday in search
LINE 520: of me!"
LINE 521: "Aunt, you do my filial heart an injustice," Chia Yün protested; "I
LINE 522: never had such a thought; had I entertained any such idea, wouldn't I,
LINE 523: aunt, have made my appeal to you yesterday? But as you are now aware of
LINE 524: everything, I'll really put uncle on one side, and prefer my request to
LINE 525: you; for circumstances compel me to entreat you, aunt, to be so good as
LINE 526: to show me some little consideration!"
LINE 527: Lady Feng laughed sardonically. "You people will choose the long road to
LINE 528: follow and put me also in a dilemma! Had you told me just one word at an
LINE 529: early hour, what couldn't have been brought about? an affair of state
LINE 530: indeed to be delayed up to this moment! In the garden, there are to be
LINE 531: more trees planted and flowers laid down, and I couldn't think of any
LINE 532: person that I could have recommended, and had you spoken before this,
LINE 533: wouldn't the whole question have been settled soon enough?"
LINE 534: "Well, in that case, aunt," ventured Chia Yün with a smile, "you had
LINE 535: better depute me to-morrow, and have done!"
LINE 536: "This job," continued lady Feng after a pause, "is not, my impression
LINE 537: is, very profitable; and if you were to wait till the first moon of next
LINE 538: year, when the fireworks, lanterns, and candles will have to be
LINE 539: purveyed, I'll depute you as soon as those extensive commissions turn
LINE 540: up."
LINE 541: "My dear aunt," pleaded Chia Yün, "first appoint me to this one, and if
LINE 542: I do really manage this satisfactorily, you can then commission me with
LINE 543: that other!"
LINE 544: "You know in truth how to draw a long thread," lady Feng observed
LINE 545: laughing. "But hadn't it been that your uncle had spoken to me on your
LINE 546: account, I wouldn't have concerned myself about you. But as I shall
LINE 547: cross over here soon after the repast, you had better come at eleven
LINE 548: a.m., and fetch the money, for you to enter into the garden the day
LINE 549: after to-morrow, and have the flowers planted!"
LINE 550: As she said this, she gave orders to drive the "scented" carriage, and
LINE 551: went on her way by the quickest cut; while Chia Yün, who was
LINE 552: irrepressibly delighted, betook himself into the I Hsia study, and
LINE 553: inquired after Pao-yü. But, who would have thought it, Pao-yü had, at an
LINE 554: early hour, gone to the mansion of the Prince of Pei Ching, so that Chia
LINE 555: Yün had to sit in a listless mood till noon; and when he found out that
LINE 556: lady Feng had returned, he speedily wrote an acknowledgment and came to
LINE 557: receive the warrant. On his arrival outside the court, he commissioned a
LINE 558: servant to announce him, and Ts'ai Ming thereupon walked out, and merely
LINE 559: asking for the receipt, went in, and, after filling in the amount, the
LINE 560: year and moon, he handed it over to Chia Yün together with the warrant.
LINE 561: Chia Yün received them from him, and as the entry consisted of two
LINE 562: hundred taels, his heart was full of exultant joy; and turning round, he
LINE 563: hurried to the treasury, where after he had taken over the amount in
LINE 564: silver, he returned home and laid the case before his mother, and
LINE 565: needless to say, that both the parent and her son were in high spirits.
LINE 566: The next day, at the fifth watch, Chia Yun first came in search of Ni
LINE 567: Erh, to whom he repaid the money, and then taking fifty taels along with
LINE 568: him, he sped outside the western gate to the house of Fang Ch'un, a
LINE 569: gardener, to purchase trees, where we will leave him without saying
LINE 570: anything more about him.
LINE 571: We will now resume our story with Pao-yü. The day on which he
LINE 572: encountered Chia Yün, he asked him to come in on the morrow and have a
LINE 573: chat with him, but this invitation was practically the mere formal talk
LINE 574: of a rich and well-to-do young man, and was not likely to be so much as
LINE 575: borne in mind; and so it was that it readily slipped from his memory. On
LINE 576: the evening of the day, however, on which he returned home from the
LINE 577: mansion of the Prince Pei Ching, he came, after paying his salutations
LINE 578: to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang, and the other inmates, back into the
LINE 579: garden; but upon divesting himself of all his fineries, he was just
LINE 580: about to have his bath, when, as Hsi Jen had, at the invitation of Hsüeh
LINE 581: Pao-ch'ai, crossed over to tie a few knotted buttons, as Ch'in Wen and
LINE 582: Pi Hen had both gone to hurry the servants to bring the water, as T'an
LINE 583: Yun had likewise been taken home, on account of her mother's illness,
LINE 584: and She Yueh, on the other hand, was at present ailing in her quarters,
LINE 585: while the several waiting-maids, who were in there besides to attend to
LINE 586: the dirty work, and answer the calls, had, surmising that he would not
LINE 587: requisition their services, one and all gone out in search of their
LINE 588: friends and in quest of their companions, it occurred, contrary to their
LINE 589: calculations, that Pao-yü remained this whole length of time quite alone
LINE 590: in his apartments; and as it so happened that Pao-yü wanted tea to
LINE 591: drink, he had to call two or three times before he at last saw three old
LINE 592: matrons walk in. But at the sight of them, Pao-yü hastily waved his hand
LINE 593: and exclaimed: "No matter, no matter; I don't want you," whereupon the
LINE 594: matrons had no help but to withdraw out of the rooms; and as Pao-yü
LINE 595: perceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come down
LINE 596: and take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heard
LINE 597: some one from behind him observe: "Master Secundus, beware, you'll
LINE 598: scorch your hand; wait until I come to pour it!" And as she spoke, she
LINE 599: walked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense
LINE 600: surprise, in fact, of Pao-yü, who inquired: "Where were you that you
LINE 601: have suddenly come to give me a start?"
LINE 602: The waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. "I was in the back
LINE 603: court," she replied, "and just came in from the back door of the inner
LINE 604: rooms; and is it likely that you didn't, sir, hear the sound of my
LINE 605: footsteps?"
LINE 606: Pao-yü drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girl
LINE 607: under a minute inspection, he found that though she wore several
LINE 608: articles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, with
LINE 609: that head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done up
LINE 610: in curls, her face so oblong, her figure so slim and elegant, indeed,
LINE 611: supremely beautiful, sweet, and spruce, and Pao-yü eagerly inquired:
LINE 612: "Are you also a girl attached to this room of mine?"
LINE 613: "I am," rejoined that waiting-maid.
LINE 614: "But since you belong to this room, how is it I don't know you?" Pao-yü
LINE 615: added.
LINE 616: When the maid heard these words, she forced a laugh. "There are even
LINE 617: many," she explained, "that are strangers to you; and is it only myself?
LINE 618: I've never, before this, served tea, or handed water, or brought in
LINE 619: anything; nor have I attended to a single duty in your presence, so how
LINE 620: could you know me?"
LINE 621: "But why don't you attend to any of those duties that would bring you to
LINE 622: my notice?" Pao-yü questioned.
LINE 623: "I too," answered the maid, "find it as difficult to answer such a
LINE 624: question. There's however one thing that I must report to you, master
LINE 625: Secundus. Yesterday, some Mr. Yün Erh or other came to see you; but as I
LINE 626: thought you, sir, had no leisure, I speedily bade Pei Ming tell him to
LINE 627: come early to-day. But you unexpectedly went over again to the mansion
LINE 628: of the Prince of Pei Ching."
LINE 629: When she had spoken as far as this, she caught sight of Ch'iu Wen and Pi
LINE 630: Hen enter the court, giggling and laughing; the two of them carrying
LINE 631: between them a bucket of water; and while raising their skirts with one
LINE 632: hand, they hobbled along, as the water spurted and plashed. The
LINE 633: waiting-maid hastily come out to meet them so as to relieve them of
LINE 634: their burden, but Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were in the act of standing face
LINE 635: to face and finding fault with each other; one saying, "You've wetted my
LINE 636: clothes," the other adding, "You've trod on my shoes," and upon, all of
LINE 637: a sudden, espying some one walk out to receive the water, and
LINE 638: discovering, when they came to see, that it was actually no one else
LINE 639: than Hsiao Hung, they were at once both so taken aback that, putting
LINE 640: down the bucket, they hurried into the room; and when they looked about
LINE 641: and saw that there was no other person inside besides Pao-yü they were
LINE 642: at once displeased. But as they were meanwhile compelled to get ready
LINE 643: the articles necessary for his bath, they waited until Pao-yü was about
LINE 644: to divest himself of his clothes, when the couple of them speedily
LINE 645: pulled the door to behind them, as they went out, and walked as far as
LINE 646: the room on the opposite side, in search of Hsiao Hung; of whom they
LINE 647: inquired: "What were you doing in his room a short while back?"
LINE 648: "When was I ever in the room?" Hsiao Hung replied; "simply because I
LINE 649: lost sight of my handkerchief, I went to the back to try and find it,
LINE 650: when unexpectedly Mr. Secundus, who wanted tea, called for you sisters;
LINE 651: and as there wasn't one even of you there, I walked in and poured a cup
LINE 652: for him, and just at that very moment you sisters came back."
LINE 653: "You barefaced, low-bred thing!" cried Ch'iu Wen, turning towards her
LINE 654: and spurting in her face. "It was our bounden duty to tell you to go and
LINE 655: hurry them for the water, but you simply maintained that you were busy
LINE 656: and made us go instead, in order to afford you an opportunity of
LINE 657: performing these wily tricks! and isn't this raising yourself up li by
LINE 658: li? But don't we forsooth, even so much as come up to you? and you just
LINE 659: take that looking-glass and see for yourself, whether you be fit to
LINE 660: serve tea and to hand water or not?"
LINE 661: "To-morrow," continued Pi Hea, "I'll tell them that whenever there's
LINE 662: anything to do connected with his wanting tea, or asking for water, or
LINE 663: with fetching things for him, not one of us should budge, and that
LINE 664: _she_ alone should be allowed to go, and have done!"
LINE 665: "If this be your suggestion," remarked Ch'iu Wen, "wouldn't it be still
LINE 666: better that we should all disperse, and let her reign supreme in this
LINE 667: room!"
LINE 668: But while the two of them were up to this trouble, one saying one thing,
LINE 669: and another, another, they caught sight of two old nurses walk in to
LINE 670: deliver a message from lady Feng; who explained: "To-morrow, someone
LINE 671: will bring in gardeners to plant trees, and she bids you keep under more
LINE 672: rigorous restraint, and not sun your clothes and petticoats anywhere and
LINE 673: everywhere; nor air them about heedlessly; that the artificial hill
LINE 674: will, all along, be entirely shut in by screening curtains, and that you
LINE 675: mustn't he running about at random."
LINE 676: "I wonder," interposed Ch'iu Wen with alacrity, "who it is that will
LINE 677: bring the workmen to-morrow, and supervise the works?"
LINE 678: "Some one or other called Mr. Yün, living at the back portico," the old
LINE 679: woman observed.
LINE 680: But Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were neither of them acquainted with him, and
LINE 681: they went on promiscuously asking further questions on his account, but
LINE 682: Hsiao Hung knew distinctly in her mind who it was, and was well aware
LINE 683: that it was the person whom she had seen, the previous day, in the outer
LINE 684: library.
LINE 685: The surname of this Hsiao Hung had, in fact, been originally Lin, while
LINE 686: her infant name had been Hung Yü; but as the word Yü improperly
LINE 687: corresponded with the names of Pao-yü and Tai-yü, she was, in due
LINE 688: course, simply called Hsiao Hung. She was indeed an hereditary servant
LINE 689: of the mansion; and her father had latterly taken over the charge of all
LINE 690: matters connected with the farms and farmhouses in every locality. This
LINE 691: Hung-yü came, at the age of sixteen, into the mansion, to enter into
LINE 692: service, and was attached to the Hung Yuan, where in point of fact she
LINE 693: found both a quiet and pleasant home; and when contrary to all
LINE 694: expectation, the young ladies as well as Pao-yü, were subsequently
LINE 695: permitted to move their quarters into the garden of Broad Vista, it so
LINE 696: happened that this place was, moreover, fixed upon by Pao-yü. This Hsiao
LINE 697: Hung was, it is true, a girl without any experience, but as she could,
LINE 698: to a certain degree, boast of a pretty face, and as, in her own heart,
LINE 699: she recklessly fostered the idea of exalting herself to a higher
LINE 700: standard, she was ever ready to thrust herself in Pao-yü's way, with a
LINE 701: view to showing herself off. But attached to Pao-yü's personal service
LINE 702: were a lot of servants, all of whom were glib and specious, so that how
LINE 703: could she ever find an opportunity of thrusting herself forward? But
LINE 704: contrary to her anticipations, there turned up, eventually on this day,
LINE 705: some faint glimmer of hope, but as she again came in for a spell of
LINE 706: spiteful abuse from Ch'iu Wen and her companion, her expectations were
LINE 707: soon considerably frustrated, and she was just plunged in a melancholy
LINE 708: mood, when suddenly she heard the old nurse begin the conversation about
LINE 709: Chia Yün, which unconsciously so affected her heart that she hastily

LINE 714: window, a faint voice say: "Hsiao Hung, I've picked up your pocket
LINE 715: handkerchief in here!" and as soon as Hsiao Hung heard these words, she
LINE 716: walked out with hurried step and found that it was no one else than Chia
LINE 717: Yün in person; and as Hsiao Hung unwillingly felt her powdered face
LINE 718: suffused with brushes: "Where did you pick it up, Mr. Secundus?" she
LINE 719: asked.
LINE 720: "Come over," Chia Yün smiled, "and I'll tell you!" And as he uttered
LINE 721: these words, he came up and drew her to him; but Hsiao Hung twisted
LINE 722: herself round and ran away; but was however tripped over by the step of
LINE 723: the door.
LINE 724: Now, reader, do you want to know the sequel? If so the next chapter will
LINE 725: explain.
