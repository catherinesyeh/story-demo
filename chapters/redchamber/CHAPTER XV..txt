LINE 1: Lady Peng, née Wang, exercises her authority in the Iron Fence Temple.
LINE 2: Ch'in Ching-ch'ing (Ch'ing Chung) amuses himself in the Man-t'ou
LINE 3: (Bread) nunnery.
LINE 4: But we shall now resume our story. When Pao-yü raised his eyes, he
LINE 5: noticed that Shih Jung, Prince of Pei Ching, wore on his head a princely
LINE 6: cap with pure white tassels and silvery feathers, that he was appareled
LINE 7: in a white ceremonial robe, (with a pattern representing) the toothlike
LINE 8: ripple of a river and the waters of the sea, embroidered with
LINE 9: five-clawed dragons; and that he was girded with a red leather belt,
LINE 10: inlaid with white jade. That his face was like a beauteous gem; that his
LINE 11: eyes were like sparkling stars; and that he was, in very truth, a human
LINE 12: being full of graceful charms.
LINE 13: Pao-yü hastily pressed forward and made a reverent obeisance, and Shih
LINE 14: Jung lost no time in extending his arms from inside the sedan-chair, and
LINE 15: embracing him. At a glance, he saw that Pao-yü had on his head a silver
LINE 16: cap, to which the hair was attached, that he had, round his forehead, a
LINE 17: flap on which were embroidered a couple of dragons issuing from the sea,
LINE 18: that he wore a white archery-sleeved robe, ornamented with dragons, and
LINE 19: that his waist was encircled by a silver belt, inlaid with pearls; that
LINE 20: his face resembled vernal flowers and that his eyes were like drops of
LINE 21: lacquer.
LINE 22: Shih Jung smiled. "Your name is," he said, "no trumped-up story; for
LINE 23: you, verily, resemble a precious gem; but where's the valuable trinket
LINE 24: you had in your mouth?" he inquired.
LINE 25: As soon as Pao-yü heard this inquiry, he hastened to produce the jade
LINE 26: from inside his clothes and to hand it over to Shih Jung. Shih Jung
LINE 27: minutely examined it; and having also read the motto on it, he
LINE 28: consequently ascertained whether it was really efficacious or not.
LINE 29: "It's true that it's said to be," Pao-yü promptly explained, "but it
LINE 30: hasn't yet been put to the test."
LINE 31: Shih Jung extolled it with unbounded praise, and, as he did so, he set
LINE 32: the variegated tassels in proper order, and, with his own hands,
LINE 33: attached it on to Pao-yü's neck. Taking also his hand in his, he
LINE 34: inquired of Pao-yü what was his age? and what books he was reading at
LINE 35: present, to each of which questions Pao-yü gave suitable answer.
LINE 36: Shih Jung perceiving the perspicacity of his speech and the propriety of
LINE 37: his utterances, simultaneously turned towards Chia Chen and observed
LINE 38: with a smile on his face: "Your worthy son is, in very truth, like the
LINE 39: young of a dragon or like the nestling of a phoenix! and this isn't an
LINE 40: idle compliment which I, a despicable prince, utter in your venerable
LINE 41: presence! But how much more glorious will be, in the future, the voice
LINE 42: of the young phoenix than that of the old phoenix, it isn't easy to
LINE 43: ascertain."
LINE 44: Chia Chen forced a smile: "My cur-like son," he replied, "cannot presume
LINE 45: to such bountiful praise and golden commendation; but if, by the virtue
LINE 46: of your Highness' excess of happiness, he does indeed realise your
LINE 47: words, he will be a source of joy to us all!"
LINE 48: "There's one thing, however," continued Shih Jung; "with the excellent
LINE 49: abilities which your worthy scion possesses, he's sure, I presume, to be
LINE 50: extremely loved by her dowager ladyship, (his grandmother), and by all
LINE 51: classes. But for young men of our age it's a great drawback to be doated
LINE 52: upon, for with over-fondness, we cannot help utterly frustrating the
LINE 53: benefits of education. When I, a despicable prince, was young, I walked
LINE 54: in this very track, and I presume that your honourable son cannot
LINE 55: likewise but do the same. By remaining at home, your worthy scion will
LINE 56: find it difficult to devote his attention to study; and he will not reap
LINE 57: any harm, were he to come, at frequent intervals, to my humble home; for
LINE 58: though my deserts be small, I nevertheless enjoy the great honour of the
LINE 59: acquaintance of all the scholars of note in the Empire, so that,
LINE 60: whenever any of them visit the capital, not one of them is there who
LINE 61: does not lower his blue eyes upon me. Hence it is that in my mean abode,
LINE 62: eminent worthies rendezvous; and were your esteemed son to come, as
LINE 63: often as he can, and converse with them and meet them, his knowledge
LINE 64: would, in that case, have every opportunity of making daily strides
LINE 65: towards improvement."
LINE 66: Chia Chen speedily bent his body and expressed his acquiescence, by way
LINE 67: of reply; whereupon Shih Jung went further, and taking off from his
LINE 68: wrist a chaplet of pearls, he presented it to Pao-yü.
LINE 69: "This is the first time we meet," he observed. "Our meeting was so
LINE 70: unexpected that I have no suitable congratulatory present to offer you.
LINE 71: This was conferred upon me by His Majesty, and is a string of
LINE 72: chaplet-pearls, scented with Ling Ling, which will serve as a temporary
LINE 73: token of respectful congratulations."
LINE 74: Pao-yü hastened to receive it from his hands, and turning round, he
LINE 75: reverently presented it to Chia Chen. Chia Chen and Pao-yü jointly
LINE 76: returned thanks; and forthwith Chia She, Chia Chen and the rest came
LINE 77: forward in a body, and requested the Prince to turn his chair homewards.
LINE 78: "The departed," expostulated Shih Jung, "has already ascended the
LINE 79: spiritual regions, and is no more a mortal being in this dusty world
LINE 80: exposed to vicissitude like you and I. Although a mean prince like me
LINE 81: has been the recipient of the favour of the Emperor, and has
LINE 82: undeservedly been called to the princely inheritance, how could I
LINE 83: presume to go before the spiritual hearse and return home?"
LINE 84: Chia She and the others, perceiving how persistent he was in his refusal
LINE 85: had no course but to take their leave, express their sense of gratitude
LINE 86: and to rejoin the cortege. They issued orders to their servants to stop
LINE 87: the band, and to hush the music, and making the procession go by, they
LINE 88: at length left the way clear for Shih Jung to prosecute his way.
LINE 89: But we will now leave him and resume our account of the funeral of the
LINE 90: Ning mansion. All along its course the road was plunged in unusual
LINE 91: commotion. As soon as they reached the city gates Chia She, Chia Cheng,
LINE 92: Chia Chen, and the others again received donations from all their fellow
LINE 93: officers and subordinates, in sacrificial sheds erected by their
LINE 94: respective families, and after they returned thanks to one after
LINE 95: another, they eventually issued from the city walls, and proceeded
LINE 96: eventually along the highway, in the direction of the Temple of the Iron
LINE 97: Fence.
LINE 98: Chia Chen, at this time, went, together with Chia Jung, up to all their
LINE 99: seniors, and pressed them to get into their sedan chairs, and to ride
LINE 100: their horses; and Chia She and all of the same age as himself were
LINE 101: consequently induced to mount into their respective carriages or chairs.
LINE 102: Chia Chen and those of the same generation were likewise about to ride
LINE 103: their horses, when lady Feng, through her solicitude on Pao-yü's
LINE 104: account, gave way to fears lest now that they had reached the open
LINE 105: country, he should do as he pleased, and not listen to the words of any
LINE 106: of the household, and lest Chia Chen should not be able to keep him in
LINE 107: check; and, as she dreaded that he might go astray, she felt compelled
LINE 108: to bid a youth call him to her; and Pao-yü had no help but to appear
LINE 109: before her curricle.
LINE 110: "My dear brother," lady Feng remarked smiling, "you are a respectable
LINE 111: person, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn't imitate those
LINE 112: monkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and I sit together in
LINE 113: this carriage; and won't that be nice?"
LINE 114: At these words, Pao-yü readily dismounted and climbed up into the
LINE 115: carriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, as
LINE 116: they continued their way.
LINE 117: But not a long time elapsed before two men, on horseback, were seen
LINE 118: approaching from the opposite direction. Coming straight up to lady
LINE 119: Feng's vehicle they dismounted, and said, as they leaned on the sides of
LINE 120: her carriage, "There's a halting place here, and will it not please your
LINE 121: ladyship to have a rest and change?"
LINE 122: Lady Feng directed them to ask the two ladies Hsing and Wang what they
LINE 123: would like to do, and the two men explained: "These ladies have
LINE 124: signified that they had no desire to rest, and they wish your ladyship
LINE 125: to suit your convenience."
LINE 126: Lady Feng speedily issued orders that they should have a rest, before
LINE 127: they prosecuted their way, and the servant youth led the harnessed
LINE 128: horses through the crowd of people and came towards the north, while
LINE 129: Pao-yü, from inside the carriage, urgently asked that Mr. Ch'in should
LINE 130: be requested to come.
LINE 131: Ch'in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track of
LINE 132: his father's carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-yü's
LINE 133: page, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment.
LINE 134: Ch'in Chung perceived from a distance that the horse, which Pao-yü had
LINE 135: been riding, walked behind lady Feng's vehicle, as it went towards the
LINE 136: north, with its saddle and bridles all piled up, and readily concluding
LINE 137: that Pao-yü must be in the same carriage with that lady, he too turned
LINE 138: his horse and came over in haste and entered, in their company, the door
LINE 139: of a farm-house.
LINE 140: This dwelling of the farmer's did not contain many rooms so that the
LINE 141: women and girls had nowhere to get out of the way; and when the village
LINE 142: lasses and country women perceived the bearing and costumes of lady
LINE 143: Feng, Pao-yü, and Ch'in Chung, they were inclined to suspect that
LINE 144: celestial beings had descended into the world.
LINE 145: Lady Feng entered a thatched house, and, in the first place, asked
LINE 146: Pao-yü and the rest to go out and play. Pao-yü took the hint, and, along
LINE 147: with Ch'in Chung, he led off the servant boys and went to romp all over
LINE 148: the place.
LINE 149: The various articles in use among the farmers they had not seen before,
LINE 150: with the result that after Pao-yü had inspected them, he thought them
LINE 151: all very strange; but he could neither make out their names nor their
LINE 152: uses. But among the servant boys, there were those who knew, and they
LINE 153: explained to them, one after another, what they were called, as well as
LINE 154: what they were for. As Pao-yü, after this explanation, nodded his head;
LINE 155: "It isn't strange," he said, "that an old writer has this line in his
LINE 156: poetical works, 'Who can realise that the food in a bowl is, grain by
LINE 157: grain, all the fruit of labour.' This is indeed so!" As he spoke, they
LINE 158: had come into another house; and at the sight of a spinning wheel on a
LINE 159: stove-bed, they thought it still more strange and wonderful, but the
LINE 160: servant boys again told them that it was used for spinning the yarn to
LINE 161: weave cloth with, and Pao-yü speedily jumping on to the stove-bed, set
LINE 162: to work turning the wheel for the sake of fun, when a village lass of
LINE 163: about seventeen or eighteen years of age came forward, and asked them
LINE 164: not to meddle with it and spoil it.
LINE 165: The servant boys promptly stopped her interference; but Pao-yü himself
LINE 166: desisted, as he added: "It's because I hadn't seen one before that I
LINE 167: came to try it for fun."
LINE 168: "You people can't do it," rejoined the lass, "let me turn it for you to
LINE 169: see."
LINE 170: Ch'in Chung secretly pulled Pao-yü and remarked, "It's great fun in this
LINE 171: village!" but Pao-yü gave him a nudge and observed, "If you talk
LINE 172: nonsense again, I'll beat you." Watching intently, as he uttered these
LINE 173: words, the village girl who started reeling the thread, and presented,
LINE 174: in very truth, a pretty sight. But suddenly an old woman from the other
LINE 175: side gave a shout. "My girl Secunda, come over at once;" and the lass
LINE 176: discarded the spinning-wheel and hastily went on her way.
LINE 177: Pao-yü was the while feeling disappointed and unhappy, when he espied a
LINE 178: servant, whom lady Feng had sent, come and call them both in. Lady Feng
LINE 179: had washed her hands and changed her costume; and asked him whether he
LINE 180: would change or not, and Pao-yü, having replied "No! it doesn't matter
LINE 181: after all if I don't change," the female attendants served tea, cakes
LINE 182: and fruits and also poured the scented tea. Lady Feng and the others
LINE 183: drank their tea, and waiting until they had put the various articles by,
LINE 184: and made all the preparations, they promptly started to get into their
LINE 185: carriages. Outside, Wang Erh had got ready tips and gave them to the
LINE 186: people of the farm, and the farm women and all the inmates went up to
LINE 187: them to express their gratitude; but when Pao-yü came to look carefully,
LINE 188: he failed to see anything of the lass who had reeled the thread. But
LINE 189: they had not gone far before they caught sight of this girl Secunda
LINE 190: coming along with a small child in her arms, who, they concluded, was
LINE 191: her young brother, laughing and chatting, in company with a few young
LINE 192: girls.
LINE 193: Pao-yü could not suppress the voice of love, but being seated in the
LINE 194: carriage, he was compelled to satisfy himself by following her with his
LINE 195: eyes. Soon however the vehicle sped on as rapidly as a cloud impelled by
LINE 196: the wind, so that when he turned his head round, there was already no
LINE 197: vestige to be seen of her; but, while they were bandying words, they had
LINE 198: unexpectedly overtaken the great concourse of the cortege.
LINE 199: Likewise, at an early stage men were stationed ahead, with Buddhist
LINE 200: drums and gold cymbals, with streamers, and jewelled coverings; and the
LINE 201: whole company of bonzes, belonging to the Iron Fence Temple, had already
LINE 202: been drawn out in a line by the sides of the road. In a short while,
LINE 203: they reached the interior of the temple, where additional sacrifices
LINE 204: were offered and Buddhistic services performed; and where altars had
LINE 205: again been erected to burn incense on. The coffin was deposited in a
LINE 206: side room of the inner court; and Pao Chu got ready a bed-room in which
LINE 207: she could keep her watch.
LINE 208: In the outer apartments, Chia Chen did the honours among the whole party
LINE 209: of relatives and friends, some of whom asked to be allowed to stay for
LINE 210: their meals, while others at this stage took their leave. And after they
LINE 211: had one by one returned thanks, the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts
LINE 212: and barons, each in respective batches, (got up to go,) and they kept on
LINE 213: leaving from between 1 and 3 p.m. before they had finally all dispersed.
LINE 214: In the inner Chambers, the ladies were solely entertained and attended
LINE 215: to by lady Feng. First to make a move were the consorts of officials;
LINE 216: and noon had also come, by the time the whole party of them had taken
LINE 217: their departure. Those that remained were simply a few relatives of the
LINE 218: same clan and others like them, who eventually left after the completion
LINE 219: of the three days' rationalistic liturgies.
LINE 220: The two ladies Hsing and Wang, well aware at this time that lady Feng
LINE 221: could on no account return home, desired to enter the city at once; and
LINE 222: madame Wang wanted to take Pao-yü home; but Pao-yü, who had, on an
LINE 223: unexpected occasion, come out into the country, entertained, of course,
LINE 224: no wish to go back; and he would agree to nothing else than to stay
LINE 225: behind with lady Feng, so that madame Wang had no alternative but to
LINE 226: hand him over to her charge and to start.
LINE 227: This Temple of the Iron Fence had, in fact, been erected in days gone
LINE 228: by, at the expense of the two dukes Ning and Jung; and there still
LINE 229: remained up to these days, acres of land, from which were derived the
LINE 230: funds for incense and lights for such occasions, on which the coffins of
LINE 231: any members, old or young, (who died) in the capital, had to be
LINE 232: deposited in this temple; and the inner and outer houses, in this
LINE 233: compound were all kept in readiness and good order, for the
LINE 234: accommodation of those who formed part of the cortège.
LINE 235: At this time, as it happened, the descendants mustered an immense crowd,
LINE 236: and among them were poor and rich of various degrees, or with likes and
LINE 237: dislikes diametrically opposed. There were those, who, being in
LINE 238: straitened circumstances at home, and easily contented, readily took up
LINE 239: their quarters in the temple. And there were those with money and
LINE 240: position, and with extravagant ideas, who maintained that the
LINE 241: accommodation in the temple was not suitable, and, of course, went in
LINE 242: search of additional quarters, either in country houses, or in convents,
LINE 243: where they could have their meals and retire, after the ceremonies were
LINE 244: over.
LINE 245: On the occasion of Mrs. Ch'in's funeral, all the members of the clan put
LINE 246: up temporarily in the Iron Fence Temple; lady Feng alone looked down
LINE 247: upon it as inconvenient, and consequently despatched a servant to go and
LINE 248: tell Ch'ing Hsü, a nun in the Bread Convent, to empty two rooms for her
LINE 249: to go and live in.
LINE 250: This Bread Convent had at one time been styled the Shui Yueh nunnery
LINE 251: (water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise to
LINE 252: this nickname.
LINE 253: This convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, so
LINE 254: that as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and the
LINE 255: sacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to request
LINE 256: lady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there still
LINE 257: remained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives,
LINE 258: she readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and,
LINE 259: along with Pao-yü and Ch'in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent.
LINE 260: Ch'in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim to
LINE 261: many ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, and
LINE 262: he bade Ch'in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its resting
LINE 263: place, with the result that Ch'in Chung came along, at the same time as
LINE 264: lady Feng and Pao-yü, to the Water Moon Convent, where Ch'ing Hsü
LINE 265: appeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, to
LINE 266: receive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and the
LINE 267: others entered the "chaste" apartments to change their clothes and wash
LINE 268: their hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller in
LINE 269: stature Chih Neng had grown and how much handsomer were her features,
LINE 270: she felt prompted to inquire, "How is it that your prioress and
LINE 271: yourselves haven't been all these days as far as our place?"
LINE 272: "It's because during these days we haven't had any time which we could
LINE 273: call our own," explained Ch'ing Hsü. "Owing to the birth of a son in Mr.
LINE 274: Hu's mansion, dame Hu sent over about ten taels and asked that we should
LINE 275: invite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for the
LINE 276: churching of women, with the result that we've been so very busy and had
LINE 277: so little leisure, that we couldn't come over to pay our respects to
LINE 278: your ladyship."
LINE 279: But leaving aside the old nun, who kept lady Feng company, we will now
LINE 280: return to the two lads Pao-yü and Ch'in Chung. They were up to their
LINE 281: pranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing Chih Neng come
LINE 282: over: "Here's Neng Erh," Pao-yü exclaimed with a smile.
LINE 283: "Why notice a creature like her?" remarked Ch'in Chung; to which Pao-yü
LINE 284: rejoined laughingly: "Don't be sly! why then did you the other day, when
LINE 285: you were in the old lady's rooms, and there was not a soul present, hold
LINE 286: her in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?"
LINE 287: "There was nothing of the kind," observed Ch'in Chung smiling.
LINE 288: "Whether there was or not," replied Pao-yü, "doesn't concern me; but if
LINE 289: you will stop her and tell her to pour a cup of tea and bring it to me
LINE 290: to drink, I'll then keep hands off."
LINE 291: "This is indeed very strange!" Ch'in Chung answered laughing; "do you
LINE 292: fear that if you told her to pour you one, that she wouldn't; and what
LINE 293: need is there that I should tell her?"
LINE 294: "If I ask her," Pao-yü observed, "to pour it, she wouldn't be as ready
LINE 295: as she would were you to tell her about it."
LINE 296: Ch'in Chung had no help but to speak. "Neng Erh!" he said, "bring a cup
LINE 297: of tea."
LINE 298: This Neng Erh had, since her youth, been in and out of the Jung mansion,
LINE 299: so that there was no one that she did not know; and she had also, time
LINE 300: after time, romped and laughed with Pao-yü and Ch'in Chung. Being now
LINE 301: grown up she gradually came to know the import of love, and she readily
LINE 302: took a fancy to Ch'in Chung, who was an amorous being. Ch'in Chung too
LINE 303: returned her affection, on account of her good looks; and, although he
LINE 304: and she had not had any very affectionate tête-à-têtes, they had,
LINE 305: however, long ago come to understand each other's feelings and wishes.
LINE 306: Chih Neng walked away and returned after having poured the tea.
LINE 307: "Give it to me," Ch'in Chung cried out smirkingly; while Pao-yü likewise
LINE 308: shouted: "Give it to me."
LINE 309: Chih Neng compressed her lips and sneeringly rejoined, "Are you going to
LINE 310: have a fight even over a cup of tea? Is it forsooth likely that there's
LINE 311: honey in my hand?"
LINE 312: Pao-yü was the first to grasp and take over the cup, but while drinking
LINE 313: it, he was about to make some inquiry, when he caught sight of Chih
LINE 314: Shan, who came and called Chih Neng away to go and lay the plates with
LINE 315: fruit on the table. Not much time elapsed before she came round to
LINE 316: request the two lads to go and have tea and refreshments; but would they
LINE 317: eat such things as were laid before them? They simply sat for a while
LINE 318: and came out again and resumed their play.
LINE 319: Lady Feng too stayed for a few moments, and then returned, with the old
LINE 320: nun as her escort, into the "unsullied" rooms to lie down. By this time,
LINE 321: all the matrons and married women discovered that there was nothing else
LINE 322: to be done, and they dispersed in succession, retiring each to rest.
LINE 323: There only remained in attendance several young girls who enjoyed her
LINE 324: confidence, and the old nun speedily availed herself of the opportunity
LINE 325: to speak. "I've got something," she said, "about which I mean to go to
LINE 326: your mansion to beg of madame Wang; but I'll first request you, my lady,
LINE 327: to tell me how to set to work."
LINE 328: "What's it?" ascertained lady Feng.
LINE 329: "O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed the old nun, "It's this; in days gone by, I
LINE 330: first lived in the Ch'ang An district. When I became a nun and entered
LINE 331: the monastery of Excellent Merit, there lived, at that time, a
LINE 332: subscriber, Chang by surname, a very wealthy man. He had a daughter,
LINE 333: whose infant name was Chin Ko; the whole family came in the course of
LINE 334: that year to the convent I was in, to offer incense, and as luck would
LINE 335: have it they met Li Ya-nei, a brother of a secondary wife of the Prefect
LINE 336: of the Ch'ang An Prefecture. This Li Ya-nei fell in love at first sight
LINE 337: with her, and would wed Chin Ko as his wife. He sent go-betweens to ask
LINE 338: her in marriage, but, contrary to his expectations, Chin Ko had already
LINE 339: received the engagement presents of the son of the ex-Major of the
LINE 340: Ch'ang An Prefecture. The Chang family, on the other hand, were afraid
LINE 341: that if they withdrew from the match, the Major would not give up his
LINE 342: claim, and they therefore replied that she was already promised to
LINE 343: another. But, who would have thought it, this Mr. Li was seriously bent
LINE 344: upon marrying the young lady. But while the Chang family were at a loss
LINE 345: what plan to devise, and both parties were in a dilemma, the family of
LINE 346: the Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without even
LINE 347: looking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse to
LINE 348: insult and abuse. 'Is a girl,' they insinuated, 'to be promised to the
LINE 349: sons of several families!' And obstinately refusing to allow the
LINE 350: restitution of the betrothal presents, they at once had recourse to
LINE 351: litigation and brought an action (against the girl's people.) That
LINE 352: family was at their wits' end, and had no alternative but to find some
LINE 353: one to go to the capital to obtain means of assistance; and, losing all
LINE 354: patience, they insisted upon the return of the presents. I believe that
LINE 355: the present commander of the troops at Ch'ang An, Mr. Yün, is on
LINE 356: friendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madame
LINE 357: Wang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr.
LINE 358: Yün to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree.
LINE 359: Should (your ladyship) be willing to take action, the Chang family are
LINE 360: even ready to present all they have, though it may entail the ruin of
LINE 361: their estate."
LINE 362: "This affair is, it's true, of no great moment," lady Feng replied
LINE 363: smiling, after hearing this appeal; "but the only thing is that madame
LINE 364: Wang does no longer attend to matters of this nature."
LINE 365: "If madame doesn't heed them," suggested the old nun, "you, my lady, can
LINE 366: safely assume the direction."
LINE 367: "I'm neither in need of any money to spend," added lady Feng with a
LINE 368: smirk, "nor do I undertake such matters!"
LINE 369: These words did not escape Ching Hsü's ear; they scattered to the winds
LINE 370: her vain hopes. After a minute or so she heaved a sigh.
LINE 371: "What you say may be true enough," she remarked; "but the Chang family
LINE 372: are also aware that I mean to come and make my appeal to your mansion;
LINE 373: and were you now not to manage this affair, the Chang family having no
LINE 374: idea that the lack of time prevents any steps being taken and that no
LINE 375: importance is attached to their presents, it will appear, on the
LINE 376: contrary, as if there were not even this little particle of skill in
LINE 377: your household."
LINE 378: At these words lady Feng felt at once inspirited. "You've known of old,"
LINE 379: she added, "that I've never had any faith in anything concerning
LINE 380: retribution in the Court of Judgment in the unseen or in hell; and that
LINE 381: whatever I say that I shall do, that I do; tell them therefore to bring
LINE 382: three thousand taels; and I shall then remedy this grievance of theirs."
LINE 383: The old nun upon hearing this remark was so exceedingly delighted, that
LINE 384: she precipitately exclaimed, "They've got it, they've got it! there will
LINE 385: be no difficulty about it."
LINE 386: "I'm not," lady Feng went on to add, "like those people, who afford help
LINE 387: and render assistance with an eye to money; these three thousand taels
LINE 388: will be exclusively devoted for the travelling expenses of those youths,
LINE 389: who will be sent to deliver messages and for them to make a few cash for
LINE 390: their trouble; but as for me I don't want even so much as a cash. In
LINE 391: fact I'm able at this very moment to produce as much as thirty thousand
LINE 392: taels."
LINE 393: The old nun assented with alacrity, and said by way of reply, "If that
LINE 394: be so, my lady, do display your charitable bounty at once to-morrow and
LINE 395: bring things to an end."
LINE 396: "Just see," remarked lady Feng, "how hard pressed I am; which place can
LINE 397: do without me? but since I've given you my word, I shall, needless to
LINE 398: say, speedily bring the matter to a close."
LINE 399: "A small trifle like this," hinted the old nun, "would, if placed in the
LINE 400: hands of any one else, flurry her to such an extent that she would be
LINE 401: quite at a loss what to do; but in your hands, my lady, even if much
LINE 402: more were superadded, it wouldn't require as much exertion as a wave of
LINE 403: your hand. But the proverb well says: 'that those who are able have much
LINE 404: to do;' for madame Wang, seeing that your ladyship manages all concerns,
LINE 405: whether large or small, properly, has still more shoved the burden of
LINE 406: everything on your shoulders, my lady; but you should, it's but right,
LINE 407: also take good care of your precious health."
LINE 408: This string of flattery pleased lady Feng more and more, so that
LINE 409: heedless of fatigue she went on to chat with still greater zest.
LINE 410: But, thing unthought of, Ch'in Chung availed himself of the darkness, as
LINE 411: well as of the absence of any one about, to come in quest of Chih Neng.
LINE 412: As soon as he reached the room at the back, he espied Chih Neng all
LINE 413: alone inside washing the tea cups; and Ch'in Chung forthwith seized her
LINE 414: in his arms and implanted kisses on her cheek. Chih Neng got in a
LINE 415: dreadful state, and stamping her feet, cried, "What are you up to?" and
LINE 416: she was just on the point of shouting out, when Ch'in Chung rejoined:
LINE 417: "My dear girl! I'm nearly dead from impatience, and if you don't again
LINE 418: to-day accept my advances, I shall this very moment die on this spot."
LINE 419: "What you're bent upon," added Chih Neng, "can't be effected; not unless
LINE 420: you wait until I've left this den and parted company from these people,
LINE 421: when it will be safe enough."
LINE 422: "This is of course easy enough!" remonstrated Ch'in Chung; "but the
LINE 423: distant water cannot extinguish the close fire!"
LINE 424: As he spoke, with one puff, he put out the light, plunging the whole
LINE 425: room in pitch darkness; and seizing Chih Neng, he pushed her on to the
LINE 426: stove-couch and started a violent love affair. Chih Neng could not,
LINE 427: though she strained every nerve, escape his importunities; nor could she
LINE 428: very well shout, so that she felt compelled to humour him; but while he
LINE 429: was in the midst of his ecstatic joy, they perceived a person walk in,
LINE 430: who pressed both of them down, without uttering even so much as a sound,
LINE 431: and plunged them both in such a fright that their very souls flew away
LINE 432: and their spirits wandered from their bodies; and it was after the third
LINE 433: party had burst out laughing with a spurting sound that they eventually
LINE 434: became aware that it was Pao-yü; when, springing to his feet
LINE 435: impetuously, Ch'in Chung exclaimed full of resentment, "What's this that
LINE 436: you're up to!"
LINE 437: "If you get your monkey up," retorted Pao-yü, "why, then let you and I
LINE 438: start bawling out;" which so abashed Chih Neng that she availed herself
LINE 439: of the gloomy light to make her escape; while Pao-yü had dragged Ch'in
LINE 440: Chung out of the room and asked, "Now then, do you still want to play
LINE 441: the bully!"
LINE 442: "My dear fellow," pleaded Ch'in Chung smilingly, "whatever you do don't
LINE 443: shout out and let every one know; and all you want, I'll agree to."
LINE 444: "We needn't argue just now," Pao-yü observed with a grin; "wait a while,
LINE 445: and when all have gone to sleep, we can minutely settle accounts
LINE 446: together."
LINE 447: Soon it was time to ease their clothes, and go to bed; and lady Feng
LINE 448: occupied the inner room; Ch'in Chung and Pao-yü the outer; while the
LINE 449: whole ground was covered with matrons of the household, who had spread
LINE 450: their bedding, and sat watching. As lady Feng entertained fears that the
LINE 451: jade of Spiritual Perception might be lost, she waited until Pao-yü fell
LINE 452: asleep, when having directed a servant to bring it to her, she placed it
LINE 453: under the side of her own pillow.
LINE 454: What accounts Pao-yü settled with Ch'in Chung cannot be ascertained; and
LINE 455: as in the absence of any positive proof what is known is based upon
LINE 456: surmises, we shall not venture to place it on record.
LINE 457: Nothing worth noticing occurred the whole night; but the next day, as
LINE 458: soon as the morning dawned, dowager lady Chia and madame Wang promptly
LINE 459: despatched servants to come and see how Pao-yü was getting on; and to
LINE 460: tell him likewise to put on two pieces of extra clothing, and that if
LINE 461: there was nothing to be done it would be better for him to go back.
LINE 462: But was it likely that Pao-yü would be willing to go back? Besides Ch'in
LINE 463: Chung, in his inordinate passion for Chih Neng, instigated Pao-yü to
LINE 464: entreat lady Feng to remain another day. Lady Feng pondered in her own
LINE 465: mind that, although the most important matters connected with the
LINE 466: funeral ceremonies had been settled satisfactorily, there were still a
LINE 467: few minor details, for which no provision had been made, so that could
LINE 468: she avail herself of this excuse to remain another day would she not win
LINE 469: from Chia Chen a greater degree of approbation, in the second place,
LINE 470: would she not be able further to bring Ch'ing Hsü's business to an
LINE 471: issue, and, in the third place, to humour Pao-yü's wish? In view of
LINE 472: these three advantages, which would accrue, "All that I had to do, I
LINE 473: have done," she readily signified to Pao-yü, "and if you be bent upon
LINE 474: running about in here, you'll unavoidably place me in still greater
LINE 475: trouble; so that we must for certain start homewards to-morrow."
LINE 476: "My dear cousin, my own dear cousin," urgently entreated Pao-yü, when he
LINE 477: heard these words, "let's stay only this one day, and to-morrow we can
LINE 478: go back without fail."
LINE 479: They actually spent another night there, and lady Feng availed herself
LINE 480: of their stay to give directions that the case which had been entrusted
LINE 481: to her the previous day by the old nun should be secretly communicated
LINE 482: to Lai Wang Erh. Lai Wang's mind grasped the import of all that was said
LINE 483: to him, and, having entered the city with all despatch, he went in
LINE 484: search of the gentleman, who acted as secretary (in Mr. Yün's office),
LINE 485: pretending that he had been directed by Mr. Chia Lien to come and ask
LINE 486: him to write a letter and to send it that very night to the Ch'ang An
LINE 487: magistrate. The distance amounted to no more than one hundred li, so
LINE 488: that in the space of two days everything was brought to a satisfactory
LINE 489: settlement. The general, whose name was Yün Kuang, had been for a long
LINE 490: time under obligations to the Chia family, so that he naturally could
LINE 491: not refuse his co-operation in such small trifles. When he had handed
LINE 492: his reply, Wang Erh started on his way back; where we shall leave him
LINE 493: and return to lady Feng.
LINE 494: Having spent another day, she on the morrow took leave of the old nun,
LINE 495: whom she advised to come to the mansion after the expiry of three days
LINE 496: to fetch a reply.
LINE 497: Ch'in Chung and Chih Neng could not, by any means, brook the separation,
LINE 498: and they secretly agreed to a clandestine assignation; but to these
LINE 499: details we need not allude with any minuteness; sufficient to say that
LINE 500: they had no alternative but to bear the anguish and to part.
LINE 501: Lady Feng crossed over again to the temple of the Iron Fence and
LINE 502: ascertained how things were progressing. But as Pao Chu was obstinate in
LINE 503: her refusal to return home, Chia Chen found himself under the necessity
LINE 504: of selecting a few servants to act as her companions. But the reader
LINE 505: must listen to what is said in the next chapter by way of explanation.
