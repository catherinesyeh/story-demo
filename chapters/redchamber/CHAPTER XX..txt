LINE 1: Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao's jealous notions.
LINE 2: Lin Tai-yü uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-yün's
LINE 3: querulous tone of voice.
LINE 4: But to continue. Pao-yü was in Tai yü's apartments relating about the
LINE 5: rat-elves, when Pao-ch'ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-yü,
LINE 6: with trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he
LINE 7: had shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of
LINE 8: them then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake
LINE 9: of fun. Pao-yü had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-yü should, by
LINE 10: being bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an
LINE 11: indigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as
LINE 12: neither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good
LINE 13: health, when luckily Pao-ch'ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed
LINE 14: together; and when Lin Tai-yü at length lost all inclination to dose, he
LINE 15: himself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard
LINE 16: clamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and
LINE 17: listened, Lin Tai-yü was the first to smile and make a remark. "It's
LINE 18: your nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!" she said. "Hsi Jen treats her
LINE 19: well enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well
LINE 20: under her thumb; she's indeed an old dotard;" and Pao-yü was anxious to
LINE 21: go over at once, but Pao-ch'ai laid hold of him and kept him back,
LINE 22: suggesting: "It's as well that you shouldn't wrangle with your nurse,
LINE 23: for she's quite stupid from old age; and it's but fair, on the contrary,
LINE 24: that you should bear with her a little."
LINE 25: "I know all about that!" Pao-yü rejoined. But having concluded this
LINE 26: remark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaning
LINE 27: on her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen,
LINE 28: saying: "You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin!
LINE 29: It's I who've raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put on
LINE 30: high airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch!
LINE 31: You saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Your
LINE 32: whole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-yü;
LINE 33: and you so impose upon Pao-yü that he doesn't notice me, but merely
LINE 34: lends an ear to what you people have to say! You're no more than a low
LINE 35: girl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever do
LINE 36: that you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? But
LINE 37: whether you like it or not, I'll drag you out from this, and give you to
LINE 38: some mean fellow, and we'll see whether you will still behave like a
LINE 39: very imp, and cajole people or not?"
LINE 40: Hsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse was
LINE 41: wrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and she
LINE 42: felt constrained to explain that "she was unwell, that she had just
LINE 43: succeeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, she
LINE 44: hadn't really perceived the old lady;" but when she came subsequently to
LINE 45: hear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-yü, and also go so far as to
LINE 46: add that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidably
LINE 47: experienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible to
LINE 48: restrain herself from beginning to cry.
LINE 49: Pao-yü had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable with
LINE 50: any propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explain
LINE 51: matters for her. "She's ill," he observed, "and is taking medicines; and
LINE 52: if you don't believe it," he went on, "well then ask the rest of the
LINE 53: servant-girls."
LINE 54: Nurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. "Your sole
LINE 55: delight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!" she remarked, "and do you
LINE 56: pay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to go
LINE 57: and ask; who's it that doesn't back you? and who hasn't been dismounted
LINE 58: from her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I'll go with you and
LINE 59: explain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I've
LINE 60: nursed you till I've brought you to this age, and now that you don't
LINE 61: feed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of the
LINE 62: servant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me."
LINE 63: As she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time,
LINE 64: Tai-yü and Pao-ch'ai had also come over, and they set to work to
LINE 65: reassure her. "You, old lady," they urged, "should bear with them a
LINE 66: little, and everything will be right!" And when nurse Li saw these two
LINE 67: arrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking up
LINE 68: the question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hsüeh, for having
LINE 69: drunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and other
LINE 70: similar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.
LINE 71: By a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upper
LINE 72: rooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings,
LINE 73: and upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting and
LINE 74: bustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li's old complaint was
LINE 75: breaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-yü's servants.
LINE 76: But she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on this
LINE 77: occasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others.
LINE 78: With hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li,
LINE 79: "Nurse," she said smiling, "don't lose your temper, on a great festival
LINE 80: like this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day in
LINE 81: excellent spirits! You're an old dame, and should, when others get up a
LINE 82: row, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren't
LINE 83: you, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will start
LINE 84: vociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full of
LINE 85: displeasure? Tell me who's not good, and I'll beat her for you; but be
LINE 86: quick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant which
LINE 87: they have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass of
LINE 88: wine!" And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way.
LINE 89: "Feng Erh," she also called, "hold the staff for your old lady Li, and
LINE 90: the handkerchief to wipe her tears with!" While nurse Li walked along
LINE 91: with lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept on
LINE 92: saying: "I don't really attach any value to this decrepid existence of
LINE 93: mine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face,
LINE 94: as it's better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of that
LINE 95: wench!"
LINE 96: Behind followed Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yü, and at the sight of the way in
LINE 97: which lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, and
LINE 98: exclaimed, laughing, "What piece of luck that this gust of wind has
LINE 99: come, and dragged away this old matron!" while Pao-yü nodded his head to
LINE 100: and fro and soliloquised with a sigh: "One can neither know whence
LINE 101: originates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor
LINE 102: can one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put
LINE 103: in her black books!"
LINE 104: Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch'ing Wen, who stood by, put
LINE 105: in her word. "Who's gone mad again?" she interposed, "and what good
LINE 106: would come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt
LINE 107: her, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn't act so
LINE 108: improperly as to involve others!"
LINE 109: Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-yü towards her: "All
LINE 110: through my having aggrieved an old nurse," she urged, "you've now again
LINE 111: given umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and
LINE 112: isn't this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in
LINE 113: third parties?"
LINE 114: When Pao-yü realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been
LINE 115: superadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment,
LINE 116: suppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie
LINE 117: down again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like
LINE 118: soup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and
LINE 119: reclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: "All you must do
LINE 120: is to take good care of your ailment; and don't give your mind to those
LINE 121: trifling matters, and get angry."
LINE 122: "Were I," Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, "to lose my temper over such
LINE 123: concerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The
LINE 124: only thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else
LINE 125: than clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you
LINE 126: rashly go and hurt people's feelings for our sakes; but they'll bear it
LINE 127: in mind, and when they find an opportunity, they'll come out with what's
LINE 128: easy enough to say, but what's not pleasant to hear, and how will we all
LINE 129: feel then?"
LINE 130: While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her
LINE 131: tears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-yü should
LINE 132: be annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress
LINE 133: them. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of
LINE 134: duties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-yü noticed
LINE 135: that she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to
LINE 136: get up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it,
LINE 137: with her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions
LINE 138: to the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.
LINE 139: "Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not," Hsi Jen advised, "you
LINE 140: should after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and
LINE 141: have a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again;
LINE 142: while I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better."
LINE 143: When Pao-yü heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and,
LINE 144: after she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw
LINE 145: her lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his
LINE 146: repast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still
LINE 147: disposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the
LINE 148: household for many years; and Pao-yü, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen,
LINE 149: hastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was
LINE 150: drowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but
LINE 151: the hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch'ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch'in
LINE 152: Wen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started
LINE 153: in search of Yüan Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with
LINE 154: them, and he espied She Yüeh alone in the outer room, having a game of
LINE 155: dominoes by lamp-light, Pao-yü inquired full of smiles: "How is it you
LINE 156: don't go with them?"
LINE 157: "I've no money," She Yüeh replied.
LINE 158: "Under the bed," continued Pao-yü, "is heaped up all that money, and
LINE 159: isn't it enough yet for you to lose from?"
LINE 160: "Had we all gone to play," She Yüeh added, "to whom would the charge of
LINE 161: this apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and
LINE 162: the whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and
LINE 163: all those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their
LINE 164: exertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed
LINE 165: some rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have
LINE 166: likewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn't they even at
LINE 167: this hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that's why I am
LINE 168: in here on watch."
LINE 169: When Pao-yü heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she
LINE 170: was another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: "I'll
LINE 171: sit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!"
LINE 172: "Since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go," resumed She
LINE 173: Yüeh, "for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won't that be nice?"
LINE 174: "What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind," Pao-yü
LINE 175: rejoined; "this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you
LINE 176: have nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you."
LINE 177: "Yes! do so!" readily assented She Yüeh, upon catching what he
LINE 178: suggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-case
LINE 179: containing a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off her
LINE 180: ornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-yü picked up the fine
LINE 181: comb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combed
LINE 182: it three or five times, when he perceived Ch'ing Wen hurriedly walk in
LINE 183: to fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: "You
LINE 184: haven't as yet drunk from the marriage cup," she said with a smile full
LINE 185: of irony, "and have you already put up your hair?"
LINE 186: "Now that you've come, let me also comb yours for you," Pao-yü
LINE 187: continued.
LINE 188: "I'm not blessed with such excessive good fortune!" Ch'ing Wen retorted,
LINE 189: and as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwith
LINE 190: dashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.
LINE 191: Pao-yü stood at the back of She Yüeh, and She Yüeh sat opposite the
LINE 192: glass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-yü
LINE 193: readily observed as he gazed in the glass, "In the whole number of rooms
LINE 194: she's the only one who has a glib tongue!"
LINE 195: She Yüeh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the
LINE 196: glass, and Pao-yü understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of "hu" was
LINE 197: heard from the portiere, and Ch'ing Wen ran in once again.
LINE 198: "How have I got a glib tongue?" she inquired; "it would be well for us
LINE 199: to explain ourselves."
LINE 200: "Go after your business, and have done," She Yüeh interposed laughingly;
LINE 201: "what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?"
LINE 202: "Will you also screen him?" Ch'ing Wen smiled significantly; "I know all
LINE 203: about your secret doings, but wait until I've got back my capital, and
LINE 204: we'll then talk matters over!"
LINE 205: With this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,
LINE 206: and during this while, Pao-yü having finished combing her hair, asked
LINE 207: She Yüeh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would
LINE 208: not like to disturb Hsi Jen.
LINE 209: Of the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when he
LINE 210: got up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night,
LINE 211: so that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her diet
LINE 212: to a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-yü
LINE 213: was so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this side
LINE 214: to his aunt Hsüeh's on a saunter. The season was the course of the first
LINE 215: moon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in the
LINE 216: inner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were all
LINE 217: having a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too came
LINE 218: over in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling,
LINE 219: Ying Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves by
LINE 220: playing at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to join
LINE 221: in their games; and Pao-ch'ai, who had always looked upon him with, in
LINE 222: fact, the same eye as she did Pao-yü, and with no different sentiment of
LINE 223: any kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on this
LINE 224: occasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together with
LINE 225: them, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. The
LINE 226: first time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart,
LINE 227: but as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutive
LINE 228: games he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due course
LINE 229: came the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if in
LINE 230: throwing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise bound
LINE 231: to be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned up
LINE 232: three spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing them
LINE 233: with spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildly
LINE 234: about, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, "one spot;"
LINE 235: while Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: "It's
LINE 236: six, it's seven, it's eight!" But the dice, as it happened, turned up at
LINE 237: one spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, he
LINE 238: speedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay hold
LINE 239: of the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated,
LINE 240: "It was distinctly an ace," she said. And as Pao-ch'ai noticed how
LINE 241: distressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh and
LINE 242: observed: "The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likely
LINE 243: that gentlemen will cheat you? and don't you yet put down the money?"
LINE 244: Ying Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch'ai
LINE 245: make these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she was
LINE 246: under the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself:
LINE 247: "This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these few
LINE 248: cash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I played
LINE 249: with Mr. Pao-yü, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress
LINE 250: himself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a
LINE 251: few servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!"
LINE 252: Pao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but
LINE 253: there and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon Chia
LINE 254: Huan exclaimed: "How can I compare with Pao-yü; you all fear him, and
LINE 255: keep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not
LINE 256: being the child of my lady." And as he uttered these words, he at once
LINE 257: gave way to tears.
LINE 258: "My dear cousin," Pao-ch'ai hastened to advise him, "leave off at once
LINE 259: language of this kind, for people will laugh at you;" and then went on
LINE 260: to scold Ying Erh, when Pao-yü just happened to come in. Perceiving him
LINE 261: in this plight, "What is the matter?" he asked; but Chia Huan had not
LINE 262: the courage to say anything.
LINE 263: Pao-ch'ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family,
LINE 264: that younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she
LINE 265: was not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-yü would not that any one
LINE 266: should entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as
LINE 267: younger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and
LINE 268: that there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of
LINE 269: doing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. "Besides," (he
LINE 270: reasoned,) "I'm the offspring of the primary wife, while he's the son of
LINE 271: the secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done,
LINE 272: there are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I
LINE 273: exercise any control over him?" But besides these, there were other
LINE 274: still more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but what
LINE 275: foolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of his
LINE 276: growing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, in
LINE 277: the way of sister, there was Yüan Ch'un, of cousins, from his paternal
LINE 278: uncle's side, there were Ying Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, and of relatives
LINE 279: also there were Shih Hsiang-yün, Lin Tai-yü, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai and the
LINE 280: rest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine and
LINE 281: unsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind,
LINE 282: and that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And for
LINE 283: this reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered by
LINE 284: him as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while the
LINE 285: relationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did not
LINE 286: however presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctions
LINE 287: bequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few of
LINE 288: their precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that,
LINE 289: among his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purport
LINE 290: of the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thought
LINE 291: whatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that it
LINE 292: was his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is why
LINE 293: Chia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in their
LINE 294: veneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certain
LINE 295: degree.
LINE 296: Pao-ch'ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-yü should call him
LINE 297: to book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time in
LINE 298: taking Chia Huan's part with a view to screening him.
LINE 299: "In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?" Pao-yü
LINE 300: inquired, "if this place isn't nice, why then go somewhere else to play.
LINE 301: But from reading books, day after day, you've studied so much that
LINE 302: you've become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn't good,
LINE 303: that must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that,
LINE 304: but is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a while
LINE 305: that it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reaping
LINE 306: some fun, and you've instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn't
LINE 307: it better then that you should be off at once."
LINE 308: Chia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to his
LINE 309: quarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was felt
LINE 310: constrained to inquire: "Where is it that you've been looked down upon
LINE 311: by being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?"
LINE 312: "I was playing with cousin Pao-ch'ai," Chia Huan readily replied, "when
LINE 313: Ying Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-yü
LINE 314: drove me away."
LINE 315: "Ts'ui!" exclaimed Mrs. Chao, "who bade you (presume so high) as to get
LINE 316: up into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place is
LINE 317: there that you can't go to and play; and who told you to run over there
LINE 318: and bring upon yourself all this shame?"
LINE 319: As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside
LINE 320: under the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily
LINE 321: asked from outside the window: "What are you up to in this happy first
LINE 322: moon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just
LINE 323: for a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what's the use of coming
LINE 324: out with all you've said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are
LINE 325: still our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and
LINE 326: sputter him with your gigantic mouth; he's at present a master, and if
LINE 327: there be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate
LINE 328: him; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with
LINE 329: you, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves."
LINE 330: Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than
LINE 331: of madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly
LINE 332: went out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe
LINE 333: a single word.
LINE 334: "You too," resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; "are a thing devoid
LINE 335: of all natural spirit! I've often told you that if you want to eat,
LINE 336: drink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whatever
LINE 337: female cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disport
LINE 338: yourself with; but you won't listen to my words. On the contrary, you
LINE 339: let all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perverse
LINE 340: in your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you've, besides,
LINE 341: no respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! and
LINE 342: your perverse purpose is to begrudge people's preferences! But what
LINE 343: you've lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? How
LINE 344: much did you lose?" she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, upon
LINE 345: hearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something in
LINE 346: the way of a reply. "I've lost," he explained, "some hundred or two
LINE 347: hundred cash."
LINE 348: "You have," rejoined lady Feng, "the good fortune of being a gentleman,
LINE 349: and do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundred
LINE 350: cash!" and turning her head round, "Feng Erh," she added, "go and fetch
LINE 351: a thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take him
LINE 352: along to go and play. And if again by and by, you're so mean and
LINE 353: deceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one to
LINE 354: report it at school, and won't your skin be flayed for you? All because
LINE 355: of this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with you
LINE 356: that his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hit
LINE 357: you with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Get
LINE 358: away," she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh,
LINE 359: and taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch'un and
LINE 360: the rest; where we shall leave him without another word.
LINE 361: But to return to Pao-yü. He was just amusing himself and laughing with
LINE 362: Pao-ch'ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce that
LINE 363: Miss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-yü rose, and was at once going
LINE 364: off when "Wait," shouted Pao-ch'ai with a smile, "and we'll go over
LINE 365: together and see her."
LINE 366: Saying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in company
LINE 367: with Pao-yü, to dowager lady Chia's on this side, where they saw Shih
LINE 368: Hsiang-yün laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catching
LINE 369: sight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, and
LINE 370: exchanged salutations.
LINE 371: Lin Tai-yü just happened to be standing by, and having set the question
LINE 372: to Pao-yü "Where do you come from?" "I come from cousin Pao-ch'ai's
LINE 373: rooms," Pao-yü readily replied.
LINE 374: Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. "What I maintain is this," she rejoined,
LINE 375: "that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, you
LINE 376: would long ago have, at once, come flying in here!"
LINE 377: "Am I only free to play with you?" Pao-yü inquired, "and to dispel your
LINE 378: ennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quite
LINE 379: casually, and will you insinuate all these things?"
LINE 380: "Your words are quite devoid of sense," Tai-yü added; "whether you go or
LINE 381: not what's that to me? neither did I tell you to give me any
LINE 382: distraction; you're quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay any
LINE 383: notice to me!"
LINE 384: Saying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room;
LINE 385: but Pao-yü promptly followed in her footsteps: "Here you are again in a
LINE 386: huff," he urged, "and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remark
LINE 387: that I shouldn't, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chatted
LINE 388: and laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come again
LINE 389: to sit and mope all alone!"
LINE 390: "Are you my keeper?" Tai-yü expostulated.
LINE 391: "I couldn't, of course," Pao-yü smiled, "presume to exercise any
LINE 392: influence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own
LINE 393: health harm!"
LINE 394: "If I do ruin my health," Tai-yü rejoined, "and I die, it's my own
LINE 395: lookout! what's that to do with you?"
LINE 396: "What's the good," protested Pao-yü, "of talking in this happy first
LINE 397: moon of dying and of living?"
LINE 398: "I _will_ say die," insisted Tai-yü, "die now, at this very moment!
LINE 399: but you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred
LINE 400: years, but what good will that be!"
LINE 401: "If all we do is to go on nagging in this way," Pao-yü remarked smiling,
LINE 402: "will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better
LINE 403: to die, and be free!"
LINE 404: "Quite so!" continued Tai-yü with alacrity, "if we go on nagging in this
LINE 405: way, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of
LINE 406: me!"
LINE 407: "I speak of my own self dying," Pao-yü added, "so don't misunderstand my
LINE 408: words and accuse people wrongly."
LINE 409: While he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch'ai entered the room: "Cousin Shih
LINE 410: is waiting for you;" she said; and with these words, she hastily pushed
LINE 411: Pao-yü on, and they walked away.
LINE 412: Tai-yü, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; and
LINE 413: disconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But not
LINE 414: time enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before
LINE 415: Pao-yü came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-yü sobbed still more
LINE 416: fervently and incessantly, and Pao-yü realising the state she was in,
LINE 417: and knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her
LINE 418: round, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft
LINE 419: phrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment,
LINE 420: and before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-yü anticipate
LINE 421: him.
LINE 422: "What have you come back again for?" she asked. "Let me die or live, as
LINE 423: I please, and have done! You've really got at present some one to play
LINE 424: with you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to
LINE 425: compose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for
LINE 426: fear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what
LINE 427: do you return here for now?"
LINE 428: Pao-yü, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to
LINE 429: her. "Is it likely," he observed in a low tone of voice, "that an
LINE 430: intelligent person like you isn't so much as aware that near relatives
LINE 431: can't be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside
LINE 432: an old friend! I'm stupid, there's no gainsaying, but I do anyhow
LINE 433: understand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first
LINE 434: place, cousins on my father's sister's side; while sister Pao-ch'ai and
LINE 435: I are two cousins on mother's sides, so that, according to the degrees
LINE 436: of relationship, she's more distant than yourself. In the second place,
LINE 437: you came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in
LINE 438: one bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has
LINE 439: only recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?"
LINE 440: "Ts'ui!" Tai-yü exclaimed. "Will I forsooth ever make you distance her!
LINE 441: who and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I
LINE 442: said) was prompted by my own motives."
LINE 443: "I too," Pao-yü urged, "made those remarks prompted by my own heart's
LINE 444: motives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the
LINE 445: feelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?"
LINE 446: Tai-yü at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a
LINE 447: long interval, "You only know," she continued, "how to feel bitter
LINE 448: against people for their action in censuring you: but you don't, after
LINE 449: all, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it's
LINE 450: hard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day
LINE 451: as an example. It's distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it
LINE 452: that you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse
LINE 453: with the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?"
LINE 454: "Why say I didn't wear it?" Pao-yü smilingly observed. "I did, but
LINE 455: seeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at
LINE 456: once took it off!"
LINE 457: Tai-yü heaved a sigh. "You'll by and by catch a cold," she remarked,
LINE 458: "and then you'll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to
LINE 459: eat!"
LINE 460: While these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-yün was seen to walk
LINE 461: in! "You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin," she ventured jokingly, "are
LINE 462: together playing every day, and though I've managed to come after ever
LINE 463: so much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!"
LINE 464: "It's invariably the rule," Tai-yü retorted smilingly, "that those who
LINE 465: have a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can't even
LINE 466: come out correctly with 'Erh' (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling
LINE 467: him 'Ai' cousin, 'Ai' cousin! And by and by when you play 'Wei Ch'i'
LINE 468: you're sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,
LINE 469: three)."
LINE 470: Pao-yü laughed. "If you imitate her," he interposed, "and get into that
LINE 471: habit, you'll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk."
LINE 472: "She won't make even the slightest allowance for any one," Hsiang-yün
LINE 473: rejoined; "her sole idea being to pick out others' faults. You may
LINE 474: readily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn't, after all,
LINE 475: offend against what's right and make fun of every person you come
LINE 476: across! But I'll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her,
LINE 477: I'll at once submit to you."
LINE 478: "Who is it?" Tai-yü vehemently inquired.
LINE 479: "If you do have the courage," Hsiang-yün answered, "to pick out cousin
LINE 480: Pao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!"
LINE 481: Tai-yü after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. "I was
LINE 482: wondering," she observed, "who it was. Is it indeed she? How could I
LINE 483: ever presume to pick out hers?"
LINE 484: Pao-yü allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something to
LINE 485: interrupt the conversation.
LINE 486: "I couldn't, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,"
LINE 487: Hsiang-yün laughed, "attain your standard! but my earnest wish is that
LINE 488: by and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites his
LINE 489: tongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listen
LINE 490: to 'ai-ya-os!' O-mi-to-fu, won't then your reward be manifest to my
LINE 491: eyes!"
LINE 492: As she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, and
LINE 493: Hsiang-yün speedily turned herself round and ran away.
LINE 494: But reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to the
LINE 495: explanation given in the next chapter.
