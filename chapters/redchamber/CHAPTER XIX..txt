LINE 1: In the vehemence of her feelings, Hua (Hsi Jen) on a quiet evening
LINE 2: admonishes Pao-yü.
LINE 3: While (the spell) of affection continues unbroken, Pao-yü, on a still
LINE 4: day, perceives the fragrance emitted from Tai-yü's person.
LINE 5: The Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace,
LINE 6: and the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, she
LINE 7: thanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of her
LINE 8: experiences on her visit home. His Majesty's dragon countenance was much
LINE 9: elated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, gold
LINE 10: and silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and the
LINE 11: other officials in the various households of her relatives. But
LINE 12: dispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the two
LINE 13: mansions of Jung and Ning.
LINE 14: With the extreme strain on mind and body for successive days, the
LINE 15: strength of one and all was, in point of fact, worn out and their
LINE 16: respective energies exhausted. And it was besides after they had been
LINE 17: putting by the various decorations and articles of use for two or three
LINE 18: days, that they, at length, got through the work.
LINE 19: Lady Feng was the one who had most to do, and whose responsibilities
LINE 20: were greatest. The others could possibly steal a few leisure moments and
LINE 21: retire to rest, while she was the sole person who could not slip away.
LINE 22: In the second place, naturally anxious as she was to excel and both to
LINE 23: fall in people's estimation, she put up with the strain just as if she
LINE 24: were like one of those who had nothing to attend to. But the one who had
LINE 25: the least to do and had the most leisure was Pao-yü.
LINE 26: As luck would have it on this day, at an early hour, Hsi Jen's mother
LINE 27: came again in person and told dowager lady Chia that she would take Hsi
LINE 28: Jen home to drink a cup of tea brewed in the new year and that she would
LINE 29: return in the evening. For this reason Pao-yü was only in the company of
LINE 30: all the waiting-maids, throwing dice, playing at chess and amusing
LINE 31: himself. But while he was in the room playing with them with a total
LINE 32: absence of zest, he unawares perceived a few waiting-maids arrive, who
LINE 33: informed him that their senior master Mr. Chen, of the Eastern Mansion,
LINE 34: had come to invite him to go and see a theatrical performance, and the
LINE 35: fireworks, which were to be let off.
LINE 36: Upon hearing these words, Pao-yü speedily asked them to change his
LINE 37: clothes; but just as he was ready to start, presents of cream, steamed
LINE 38: with sugar, arrived again when least expected from the Chia Consort, and
LINE 39: Pao-yü recollecting with what relish Hsi Jen had partaken of this dish
LINE 40: on the last occasion forthwith bid them keep it for her; while he went
LINE 41: himself and told dowager lady Chia that he was going over to see the
LINE 42: play.
LINE 43: The plays sung over at Chia Chen's consisted, who would have thought it,
LINE 44: of "Ting L'ang recognises his father," and "Huang Po-ying deploys the
LINE 45: spirits for battle," and in addition to these, "Sung Hsing-che causes
LINE 46: great commotion in the heavenly palace;" "Ghiang T'ai-kung kills the
LINE 47: general and deifies him," and other such like. Soon appeared the spirits
LINE 48: and devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also became
LINE 49: visible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were some
LINE 50: waving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha and
LINE 51: burning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts and
LINE 52: cries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the whole
LINE 53: street, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, and
LINE 54: that the like could never have been had in the house of any other
LINE 55: family.
LINE 56: Pao-yü, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage so
LINE 57: unbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sitting
LINE 58: for a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun.
LINE 59: First of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some time
LINE 60: in chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondary
LINE 61: wives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and as
LINE 62: Mrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he was
LINE 63: going out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, without
LINE 64: so much as keeping an eye over him.
LINE 65: Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Hsúeh P'an and the others were bent upon guessing
LINE 66: enigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundred
LINE 67: and one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticed
LINE 68: that he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined that
LINE 69: he had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. And
LINE 70: as for the pages, who had come along with Pao-yü, those who were a
LINE 71: little advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-yü would, on an
LINE 72: occasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk,
LINE 73: stealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, to
LINE 74: gamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives and
LINE 75: friends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling and
LINE 76: drinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for dusk
LINE 77: before they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept into
LINE 78: the green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-yü
LINE 79: perceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading
LINE 80: room, which existed in previous days on this side, in which was
LINE 81: suspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to look
LINE 82: life-like. "On such a bustling day as this," he reasoned, "it's pretty
LINE 83: certain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautiful
LINE 84: person must surely too feel lonely, so that it's only right that I
LINE 85: should go and console her a bit." With these thoughts, he hastily betook
LINE 86: himself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to the
LINE 87: window, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-yü was really
LINE 88: quite startled. "What!" (he thought), "can that beautiful girl,
LINE 89: possibly, have come to life!" and screwing up his courage, he licked a
LINE 90: hole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,
LINE 91: who had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewise
LINE 92: indulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.
LINE 93: "Dreadful!" exclaimed Pao-yü, aloud, unable to repress himself, and,
LINE 94: stamping one of his feet, he walked into the door to the terror of both
LINE 95: of them, who parting company, shivered with fear, like clothes that are
LINE 96: being shaken. Ming Yen perceiving that it was Pao-yü promptly fell on
LINE 97: his knees and piteously implored for pardon.
LINE 98: "What! in broad daylight! what do you mean by it? Were your master Mr.
LINE 99: Chen to hear of it, would you die or live?" asked Pao-yü, as he
LINE 100: simultaneously cast a glance at the servant-girl, who although not a
LINE 101: beauty was anyhow so spick and span, and possessed besides a few charms
LINE 102: sufficient to touch the heart. From shame, her face was red and her ears
LINE 103: purple, while she lowered her head and uttered not a syllable.
LINE 104: Pao-yü stamped his foot. "What!" he shouted, "don't you yet bundle
LINE 105: yourself away!"
LINE 106: This simple remark suggested the idea to the girl's mind who ran off, as
LINE 107: if she had wings to fly with; but as Pao-yü went also so far as to go in
LINE 108: pursuit of her, calling out: "Don't be afraid, I'm not one to tell
LINE 109: anyone," Ming Yen was so exasperated that he cried, as he went after
LINE 110: them, "My worthy ancestor, this is distinctly telling people about it."
LINE 111: "How old is that servant girl?" Pao-yü having asked; "She's, I expect,
LINE 112: no more than sixteen or seventeen," Ming Yen rejoined.
LINE 113: "Well, if you haven't gone so far as to even ascertain her age," Pao-yü
LINE 114: observed, "you're sure to know still less about other things; and it
LINE 115: makes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain and
LINE 116: futile! What a pity! what a pity!"
LINE 117: He then went on to enquire what her name was; and "Were I," continued
LINE 118: Ming Yen smiling, "to tell you about her name it would involve a long
LINE 119: yarn; it's indeed a novel and strange story! She relates that while her
LINE 120: mother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dream
LINE 121: possession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, in
LINE 122: variegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuous
LINE 123: line of the character Wan; and that this reason accounts for the name of
LINE 124: Wan Erh, which was given her."
LINE 125: "This is really strange!" Pao-yü exclaimed with a grin, after lending an
LINE 126: ear to what he had to say; "and she is bound, I think, by and by to have
LINE 127: a good deal of good fortune!"
LINE 128: These words uttered, he plunged in deep thought for a while, and Ming
LINE 129: Yen having felt constrained to inquire: "Why aren't you, Mr. Secundus,
LINE 130: watching a theatrical performance of this excellent kind?" "I had been
LINE 131: looking on for ever so long," Pao-yü replied, "until I got quite weary;
LINE 132: and had just come out for a stroll, when I happened to meet you two. But
LINE 133: what's to be done now?"
LINE 134: Ming Yen gave a faint smile. "As there's no one here to know anything
LINE 135: about it," he added, "I'll stealthily take you, Mr. Secundus, for a walk
LINE 136: outside the city walls; and we'll come back shortly, before they've got
LINE 137: wind of it."
LINE 138: "That won't do," Pao-yü demurred, "we must be careful, or else some
LINE 139: beggar might kidnap us away; besides, were they to come to hear of it,
LINE 140: there'll be again a dreadful row; and isn't it better that we should go
LINE 141: to some nearer place, from which we could, after all, return at once?"
LINE 142: "As for some nearer place," Ming Yen observed; "to whose house can we
LINE 143: go? It's really no easy matter!"
LINE 144: "My idea is," Pao-yü suggested with a smirk, "that we should simply go,
LINE 145: and find sister Hua, and see what she's up to at home."
LINE 146: "Yes! Yes!" Ming Yen replied laughingly; "the fact is I had forgotten
LINE 147: all about her home; but should it reach their ears," he continued,
LINE 148: "they'll say that it was I who led you, Mr. Secundus, astray, and
LINE 149: they'll beat me!"
LINE 150: "I'm here for you!" Pao-yü having assured him; Ming Yen at these words
LINE 151: led the horses round, and the two of them speedily made their exit by
LINE 152: the back gate. Luckily Hsi Jen's house was not far off. It was no
LINE 153: further than half a li's distance, so that in a twinkle they had already
LINE 154: reached the front of the door, and Ming Yen was the first to walk in and
LINE 155: to call for Hsi Jen's eldest brother Hua Tzu-fang.
LINE 156: Hsi Jen's mother had, on this occasion, united in her home Hsi Jen,
LINE 157: several of her sister's daughters, as well as a few of her nieces, and
LINE 158: they were engaged in partaking of fruits and tea, when they heard some
LINE 159: one outside call out, "Brother Hua." Hua Tzu-fang lost no time in
LINE 160: rushing out; and upon looking and finding that it was the two of them,
LINE 161: the master and his servant, he was so taken by surprise that his fears
LINE 162: could not be set at rest. Promptly, he clasped Pao-yü in his arms and
LINE 163: dismounted him, and coming into the court, he shouted out at the top of
LINE 164: his voice: "Mr. Pao has come." The other persons heard the announcement
LINE 165: of his arrival, with equanimity, but when it reached Hsi Jen's ears, she
LINE 166: truly felt at such a loss to fathom the object of his visit that issuing
LINE 167: hastily out of the room, she came to meet Pao-yü, and as she laid hold
LINE 168: of him: "Why did you come?" she asked.
LINE 169: "I felt awfully dull," Pao-yü rejoined with a smile, "and came to see
LINE 170: what you were up to."
LINE 171: Hsi Jen at these words banished, at last, all anxiety from her mind.
LINE 172: "You're again up to your larks," she observed, "but what's the aim of
LINE 173: your visit? Who else has come along with him?" she at the same time went
LINE 174: on to question Ming Yen.
LINE 175: "All the others know nothing about it!" explained Ming Yen exultingly;
LINE 176: "only we two do, that's all."
LINE 177: When Hsi Jen heard this remark, she gave way afresh to solicitous fears:
LINE 178: "This is dreadful!" she added; "for were you to come across any one from
LINE 179: the house, or to meet master; or were, in the streets, people to press
LINE 180: against you, or horses to collide with you, as to make (his horse) shy,
LINE 181: and he were to fall, would that too be a joke? The gall of both of you
LINE 182: is larger than a peck measure; but it's all you, Ming Yen, who has
LINE 183: incited him, and when I go back, I'll surely tell the nurses to beat
LINE 184: you."
LINE 185: Ming Yen pouted his mouth. "Mr. Secundus," he pleaded, "abused me and
LINE 186: beat me, as he bade me bring him here, and now he shoves the blame on my
LINE 187: shoulders! 'Don't let us go,' I suggested; 'but if you do insist, well
LINE 188: then let us go and have done.'"
LINE 189: Hua Tzu-fang promptly interceded. "Let things alone," he said; "now that
LINE 190: they're already here, there's no need whatever of much ado. The only
LINE 191: thing is that our mean house with its thatched roof is both so crammed
LINE 192: and so filthy that how could you, sir, sit in it!"
LINE 193: Hsi Jen's mother also came out at an early period to receive him, and
LINE 194: Hsi Jen pulled Pao-yü in. Once inside the room, Pao-yü perceived three
LINE 195: or five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, all
LINE 196: lowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffused
LINE 197: with blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid that
LINE 198: Pao-yü would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on the
LINE 199: stove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and to
LINE 200: at once bring him a cup of good tea.
LINE 201: "You needn't be flurrying all for nothing," Hsi Jen smilingly
LINE 202: interposed; "I, naturally, should know; and there's no use of even
LINE 203: laying out any fruits, as I daren't recklessly give him anything to
LINE 204: eat."
LINE 205: Saying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on a
LINE 206: stool, and after Pao-yü took a seat on it, she placed the footstove she
LINE 207: had been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, two
LINE 208: peach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove and
LINE 209: threw them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again and
LINE 210: placed it in Pao-yü's lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cup
LINE 211: with tea and presented it to Pao-yü, while, during this time, her mother
LINE 212: and sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tableful
LINE 213: of every kind of eatables.
LINE 214: Hsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,
LINE 215: but she felt urged to say with a smile: "Since you've come, it isn't
LINE 216: right that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be
LINE 217: good or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my
LINE 218: house!"
LINE 219: As she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and
LINE 220: cracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and
LINE 221: presented them to Pao-yü. But Pao-yü, espying that Hsi Jen's two eyes
LINE 222: were slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietly
LINE 223: therefore inquired of Hsi Jen, "Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?"
LINE 224: "Why should I cry?" Hsi Jen laughed; "something just got into my eyes
LINE 225: and I rubbed them." By these means she readily managed to evade
LINE 226: detection; but seeing that Pao-yü wore a deep red archery-sleeved
LINE 227: pelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes'
LINE 228: ribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. "What!
LINE 229: have you," she asked, "put on again your new clothes for? specially to
LINE 230: come here? and didn't they inquire of you where you were going?"
LINE 231: "I had changed," Pao-yü explained with a grin, "as Mr. Chen had invited
LINE 232: me to go over and look at the play."
LINE 233: "Well, sit a while and then go back;" Hsi Jen continued as she nodded
LINE 234: her head; "for this isn't the place for you to come to!"
LINE 235: "You'd better be going home now," Pao-yü suggested smirkingly; "where
LINE 236: I've again kept something good for you."
LINE 237: "Gently," smiled Hsi Jen, "for were you to let them hear, what figure
LINE 238: would we cut?" And with these, words, she put out her hand and
LINE 239: unclasping from Pao-yü's neck the jade of Spiritual Perception, she
LINE 240: faced her cousins and remarked exultingly. "Here! see for yourselves;
LINE 241: look at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you all
LINE 242: thought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it;
LINE 243: to-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever precious
LINE 244: thing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such an
LINE 245: object as this!"
LINE 246: When she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and after
LINE 247: they had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properly
LINE 248: on Pao-yü's neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a small
LINE 249: carriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-yü back home.
LINE 250: "If I see him back," Hua Tzu-fang remarked, "there would be no harm,
LINE 251: were he even to ride his horse!"
LINE 252: "It isn't because of harm," Hsi Jen replied; "but because he may come
LINE 253: across some one from the house."
LINE 254: Hua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it came
LINE 255: to the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they of
LINE 256: course had to see Pao-yü out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the other
LINE 257: hand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at the
LINE 258: same time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to let
LINE 259: off, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewise
LINE 260: incur blame.
LINE 261: As she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-yü as far as
LINE 262: outside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedan
LINE 263: chair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, the
LINE 264: two of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Upon
LINE 265: reaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen told
LINE 266: the chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, "It's advisable that I
LINE 267: should again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to show
LINE 268: ourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don't,
LINE 269: people will suspect!"
LINE 270: Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,
LINE 271: promptly clasped Pao-yü out of the chair and put him on the horse,
LINE 272: whereupon after Pao-yü smilingly remarked: "Excuse me for the trouble
LINE 273: I've surely put you to," they forthwith entered again by the back gate;
LINE 274: but putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-yü.
LINE 275: After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his
LINE 276: apartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.
LINE 277: Some there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a
LINE 278: game of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of
LINE 279: melon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to
LINE 280: come in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see
LINE 281: Pao-yü, and perceiving that Pao-yü was not at home and that the
LINE 282: servant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted.
LINE 283: "Since I've left this place," she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, "and
LINE 284: don't often come here, you've become more and more unmannerly; while the
LINE 285: other nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you;
LINE 286: Pao-yü is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others,
LINE 287: and throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon people
LINE 288: as being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it
LINE 289: topsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!"
LINE 290: These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-yü was not particular in
LINE 291: these respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old
LINE 292: age, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over
LINE 293: them, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and
LINE 294: paid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking
LINE 295: about Pao-yü, "How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he
LINE 296: went to sleep?" to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at
LINE 297: random; some there being too who observed: "What a dreadful despicable
LINE 298: old thing she is!"
LINE 299: "In this covered bowl," she continued to inquire, "is cream, and why not
LINE 300: give it to me to eat?" and having concluded these words, she took it up
LINE 301: and there and then began eating it.
LINE 302: "Be quick, and leave it alone!" a servant-girl expostulated, "that, he
LINE 303: said, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, when
LINE 304: he again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,
LINE 305: confess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to
LINE 306: bear his resentment."
LINE 307: Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. "I can't
LINE 308: believe," she forthwith remarked, "that he has become so bad at heart!
LINE 309: Not to speak of the milk I've had, I have, in fact every right to even
LINE 310: something more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi
LINE 311: Jen dearer than myself? It can't forsooth be that he doesn't bear in
LINE 312: mind how that I've brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has
LINE 313: eaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will
LINE 314: be because I'm now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!
LINE 315: I shall, yes, eat it, and we'll see what he'll do! I don't know what you
LINE 316: people think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I've with my
LINE 317: own hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!"
LINE 318: As she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank the
LINE 319: whole of it.
LINE 320: "They don't know how to speak properly!" another servant-girl interposed
LINE 321: sarcastically, "and it's no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry!
LINE 322: Pao-yü still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of his
LINE 323: gratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such a
LINE 324: thing like this?"
LINE 325: "You girls shouldn't also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!"
LINE 326: nurse Li added; "do you imagine that I'm not aware of the dismissal, the
LINE 327: other day, of Hsi Hsüeh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it's clear
LINE 328: enough that I've incurred blame, I'll come by and by and receive it!"
LINE 329: Having said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long interval
LINE 330: elapsed before Pao-yü returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen;
LINE 331: and perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: "I
LINE 332: presume she's ill," Pao-yü felt constrained to inquire, "or if she isn't
LINE 333: ill, she must have lost at cards."
LINE 334: "Not so!" observed Chiu Wen; "she had been a winner, but dame Li came in
LINE 335: quite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she
LINE 336: rushed off to sleep."
LINE 337: "Don't place yourselves," Pao-yü smiled, "on the same footing as nurse
LINE 338: Li, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right."
LINE 339: These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the
LINE 340: mutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-yü: "Where did you
LINE 341: have your repast? and what time did you come back?" and to present
LINE 342: likewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the
LINE 343: girls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her
LINE 344: costume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-yü bade them fetch
LINE 345: the cream.
LINE 346: "Nurse Li has eaten it," the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-yü was
LINE 347: on the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere,
LINE 348: laughing the while; "Is it really this that you had kept for me? many
LINE 349: thanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very
LINE 350: toothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach,
LINE 351: and was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up
LINE 352: that I felt all right. So it's as well that she has had it, for, had it
LINE 353: been kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy
LINE 354: are dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I'll go and lay the
LINE 355: bed!"
LINE 356: Pao-yü upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that he
LINE 357: discarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he,
LINE 358: with his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same time
LINE 359: that none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and
LINE 360: inquired of Hsi Jen: "Who were those persons dressed in red to day?"
LINE 361: "They're my two cousins on my mother's side," Hsi Jen explained, and
LINE 362: hearing this, Pao-yü sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.
LINE 363: "What are you sighing for?" Hsi Jen remarked. "I know the secret reasons
LINE 364: of your heart; it's I fancy because she isn't fit to wear red!"
LINE 365: "It isn't that," Pao-yü protested smilingly, "it isn't that; if such a
LINE 366: person as that isn't good enough to be dressed in red, who would
LINE 367: forsooth presume to wear it? It's because I find her so really lovely!
LINE 368: and if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice
LINE 369: it would be then!"
LINE 370: Hsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. "That it's my own fate to be a slave
LINE 371: doesn't matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my very
LINE 372: relatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But you
LINE 373: should certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, for
LINE 374: she would in that case be good enough to enter your house."
LINE 375: "Here you are again with your touchiness!" Pao-yü eagerly exclaimed
LINE 376: smiling, "if I said that she should come to our house, does it
LINE 377: necessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn't it do were
LINE 378: I to mention that she should come as a relative!"
LINE 379: "That too couldn't exalt her to be a fit match for you!" rejoined Hsi
LINE 380: Jen; but Pao-yü being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied
LINE 381: himself with cleaning the chestnuts.
LINE 382: "How is it you utter not a word?" Hsi Jen laughed; "I expect it's
LINE 383: because I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and by
LINE 384: you have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to
LINE 385: purchase them with, and bring them in and have done!"
LINE 386: "How would you have one make any reply?" Pao-yü smilingly rejoined; "all
LINE 387: I did was to extol her charms; for she's really fit to have been born in
LINE 388: a deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn't for such foul
LINE 389: things as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this
LINE 390: place!"
LINE 391: "Though deprived of this good fortune," Hsi Jen explained, "she's
LINE 392: nevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle
LINE 393: and my aunt! She's now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way
LINE 394: of trousseau has been got ready, and she's to get married next year."
LINE 395: Upon hearing the two words "get married," he could not repress himself
LINE 396: from again ejaculating: "Hai hai!" but while he was in an unhappy frame
LINE 397: of mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: "Ever
LINE 398: since I've come here, we cousins haven't all these years been able to
LINE 399: get to live together, and now that I'm about to return home, they, on
LINE 400: the other hand, will all be gone!"
LINE 401: Pao-yü, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or
LINE 402: other, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he
LINE 403: inquired: "How is it that you now want to go back?"
LINE 404: "I was present to-day," Hsi Jen explained, "when mother and brother held
LINE 405: consultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and
LINE 406: that next year they'll come up and redeem me out of service!"
LINE 407: Pao-yü, at these words, felt the more distressed. "Why do they want to
LINE 408: redeem you?" he consequently asked.
LINE 409: "This is a strange question!" Hsi Jen retorted, "for I can't really be
LINE 410: treated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the
LINE 411: members of my family are elsewhere, and there's only myself in this
LINE 412: place, so that how could I end my days here?"
LINE 413: "If I don't let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get
LINE 414: away!" Pao-yü replied.
LINE 415: "There has never been such a principle of action!" urged Hsi Jen; "even
LINE 416: in the imperial palace itself, there's a fixed rule, by which possibly
LINE 417: every certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes
LINE 418: place), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and
LINE 419: there's no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to
LINE 420: speak of your own home."
LINE 421: Pao-yü realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, was
LINE 422: right, and he went on to observe: "Should the old lady not give you your
LINE 423: release, it will be impossible for you to get off."
LINE 424: "Why shouldn't she release me?" Hsi Jen questioned. "Am I really so very
LINE 425: extraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression upon
LINE 426: her venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in not
LINE 427: letting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some more
LINE 428: ounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, in
LINE 429: truth, I'm also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are many
LINE 430: more superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I've been in
LINE 431: her old ladyship's service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for several
LINE 432: years, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term of
LINE 433: years; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as a
LINE 434: matter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemption
LINE 435: money won't be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to let
LINE 436: me go at once. And, as for being told that I can't be allowed to go as
LINE 437: I'm so diligent in my service to you, that's a thing that can on no
LINE 438: account come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of my
LINE 439: duties, and is no exceptional service! and when I'm gone you'll again
LINE 440: have some other faithful attendant, and it isn't likely that when I'm no
LINE 441: more here, you'll find it impracticable to obtain one!"
LINE 442: After Pao-yü had listened to these various arguments, which proved the
LINE 443: reasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention,
LINE 444: he felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. "In spite of all
LINE 445: you say," he therefore continued, "the sole desire of my heart is to
LINE 446: detain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to your
LINE 447: mother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money,
LINE 448: she'll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decency
LINE 449: take you home!"
LINE 450: "My mother won't naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!" Hsi Jen
LINE 451: ventured, "not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be told
LINE 452: her and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were she
LINE 453: even not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cash
LINE 454: given her, she won't, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presume
LINE 455: not to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. One
LINE 456: thing however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust upon
LINE 457: honorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn't like
LINE 458: anything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per cent
LINE 459: profit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be well
LINE 460: taken if the seller doesn't suffer loss! But in the present instance,
LINE 461: were they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of no
LINE 462: benefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental in
LINE 463: keeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feel
LINE 464: positive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!"
LINE 465: After lending an ear to this argument, Pao-yü cogitated within himself
LINE 466: for a while. "From what you say," he then observed, "when you say you'll
LINE 467: go, it means that you'll go for certain!"
LINE 468: "Yes, that I'll go for certain," Hsi Jen rejoined.
LINE 469: "Who would have anticipated," Pao-yü, after these words, mused in his
LINE 470: own heart, "that a person like her would have shown such little sense of
LINE 471: gratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I," he then remarked aloud
LINE 472: with a sigh, "been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish would
LINE 473: have been to go, I wouldn't, in that case, have brought you over! But
LINE 474: when you're away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!"
LINE 475: As he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, he
LINE 476: went to sleep.
LINE 477: The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother
LINE 478: and brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and
LINE 479: then observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not
LINE 480: return home. "When in past days," she had argued, "you had no rice to
LINE 481: eat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and
LINE 482: hadn't I urged you to sell me, wouldn't I have seen both father and
LINE 483: mother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you've now had the good
LINE 484: fortune of selling me into this place, where I'm fed and clothed just
LINE 485: like a mistress, and where I'm not beaten by day, nor abused by night!
LINE 486: Besides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting
LINE 487: things straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed
LINE 488: its primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened
LINE 489: circumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more
LINE 490: money, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there's no
LINE 491: such need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time
LINE 492: as this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn't
LINE 493: again recall any idea of redeeming me!"
LINE 494: Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and
LINE 495: brother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of
LINE 496: mind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.
LINE 497: What is more they had sold her under contract until death, in the
LINE 498: distinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a family
LINE 499: as it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, make
LINE 500: them a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In the
LINE 501: second place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of those
LINE 502: below; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness.
LINE 503: Besides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in the
LINE 504: apartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so far
LINE 505: unlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughters
LINE 506: even of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been so
LINE 507: looked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as well
LINE 508: as her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, and
LINE 509: when Pao-yü had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the two
LINE 510: of them (Pao-yü and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, the
LINE 511: mother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, and
LINE 512: still one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to the
LINE 513: ground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had never
LINE 514: reckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not again
LINE 515: entertain any idea of ransoming her.
LINE 516: It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not
LINE 517: been blind to the fact that Pao-yü had an extraordinary temperament,
LINE 518: that he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young
LINE 519: lads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many
LINE 520: unspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the
LINE 521: fond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not
LINE 522: exercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more
LINE 523: remiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least
LINE 524: pleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she
LINE 525: entertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen
LINE 526: to her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion
LINE 527: respecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first
LINE 528: instance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to
LINE 529: suppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some
LINE 530: words of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-yü had now silently
LINE 531: gone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of
LINE 532: her return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had,
LINE 533: as far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she
LINE 534: feared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which
LINE 535: might again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hsüeh drank the tea,
LINE 536: she consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in
LINE 537: order to put off Pao-yü from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the
LINE 538: matter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids
LINE 539: to take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed
LINE 540: Pao-yü; but at the sight of Pao-yü with the traces of tears on his face,
LINE 541: she at once put on a smiling expression and said: "What's there in this
LINE 542: to wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of
LINE 543: course, not go away!"
LINE 544: Pao-yü noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and
LINE 545: readily observed: "Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in
LINE 546: keeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say
LINE 547: how!"
LINE 548: "Of our friendliness all along," Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, "there's
LINE 549: naturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind
LINE 550: to retain me here, it isn't through this friendship that you'll succeed
LINE 551: in doing so. But I'll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,
LINE 552: if you really do accede to my wishes, you'll then have shown an earnest
LINE 553: desire to keep me here, and I won't go, were even a sword to be laid on
LINE 554: my neck!"
LINE 555: "Do tell me what these conditions are," Pao-yü pressed her with
LINE 556: alacrity, as he smiled, "and I'll assent to one and all. My dear sister,
LINE 557: my own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three
LINE 558: hundred of them I'm quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you
LINE 559: and all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me,
LINE 560: until some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying
LINE 561: ashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and
LINE 562: they likewise possess sense, but until I've been metamorphosed into a
LINE 563: streak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff
LINE 564: dispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as
LINE 565: much as I myself won't be able to heed you. You will, when that time
LINE 566: comes, let me go where I please, as I'll let you speed where you choose
LINE 567: to go!"
LINE 568: These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over
LINE 569: his mouth. "Speak decently," she said; "I was on account of this just
LINE 570: about to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more
LINE 571: loathsome trash."
LINE 572: "I won't utter these words again," Pao-yü eagerly added.
LINE 573: "This is the first fault that you must change," Hsi Jen replied.
LINE 574: "I'll amend," Pao-yü observed, "and if I say anything of the kind again
LINE 575: you can wring my mouth; but what else is there?"
LINE 576: "The second thing is this," Hsi Jen explained; "whether you really like
LINE 577: to study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but
LINE 578: you should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence
LINE 579: of any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and
LINE 580: make fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of
LINE 581: study, so that you shouldn't besides provoke your father so much to
LINE 582: anger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying
LINE 583: something! 'In my family,' he reflects within himself, 'generation after
LINE 584: generation has been fond of books, but ever since I've had you, you
LINE 585: haven't accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don't
LINE 586: care about reading books,'--and this has already filled his heart with
LINE 587: anger and vexation,--'but both before my face and behind my back, you
LINE 588: utter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have,
LINE 589: through their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname
LINE 590: of the "the salaried worms." You also uphold that there's no work
LINE 591: exclusive (of the book where appears) "fathom spotless virtue;" and that
LINE 592: all other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin
LINE 593: to former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of
LINE 594: Confucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.' Now
LINE 595: with words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience,
LINE 596: and if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you
LINE 597: make other people think of you?"
LINE 598: "I won't say these things again," Pao-yü laughingly protested, "these
LINE 599: are the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and
LINE 600: had no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth;
LINE 601: but I'll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?"
LINE 602: "It isn't right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the
LINE 603: Taoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge," Hsi Jen continued;
LINE 604: "but there's still another thing more important, you shouldn't again
LINE 605: indulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on
LINE 606: their lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!"
LINE 607: "I'll change in all this," Pao-yü added by way of rejoinder; "I'll
LINE 608: change in all this; and if there's anything more be quick and tell me."
LINE 609: "There's nothing more," Hsi Jen observed; "but you must in everything
LINE 610: exercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and
LINE 611: allow your wishes to run riot, and you'll be all right. And should you
LINE 612: comply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn't carry me out,
LINE 613: even in a chair with eight bearers."
LINE 614: "Well, if you do stay in here long enough," Pao-yü remarked with a
LINE 615: smile, "there's no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to
LINE 616: sit in!"
LINE 617: Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. "I don't care much about it," she replied;
LINE 618: "and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn't enjoy such a
LINE 619: right. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in
LINE 620: it!"
LINE 621: While these two were chatting, they saw Ch'iu Wen walk in. "It's the
LINE 622: third watch of the night," she observed, "and you should go to sleep.
LINE 623: Just a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a
LINE 624: nurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep."
LINE 625: Pao-yü bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found
LINE 626: indeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth
LINE 627: again and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave
LINE 628: him without any further comment.
LINE 629: The next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her body
LINE 630: heavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire.
LINE 631: She managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but as
LINE 632: subsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she felt
LINE 633: disposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes on
LINE 634: the stove-couch. Pao-yü hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and the
LINE 635: doctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing her
LINE 636: complaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her than
LINE 637: a chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken a
LINE 638: dose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would be
LINE 639: quite well. After he had written the prescription and taken his
LINE 640: departure, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which when
LINE 641: brought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose,
LINE 642: Pao-yü bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring on
LINE 643: perspiration; while he himself came into Tai-yü's room to look her up.
LINE 644: Tai-yü was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having a
LINE 645: midday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend to
LINE 646: whatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness and
LINE 647: silence. Pao-yü raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walked
LINE 648: in; and upon espying Tai-yü in the room fast asleep, he hurriedly
LINE 649: approached her and pushing her: "Dear cousin," he said, "you've just had
LINE 650: your meal, and are you asleep already?" and he kept on calling "Tai-yü"
LINE 651: till he woke her out of her sleep.
LINE 652: Perceiving that it was Pao-yü, "You had better go for a stroll," Tai-yü
LINE 653: urged, "for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night,
LINE 654: and up to this day I haven't had rest enough to get over the fatigue. My
LINE 655: whole body feels languid and sore."
LINE 656: "This languor and soreness," Pao-yü rejoined, "are of no consequence;
LINE 657: but if you go on sleeping you'll be feeling very ill; so I'll try and
LINE 658: distract you, and when we've dispelled this lassitude, you'll be all
LINE 659: right."
LINE 660: Tai-yü closed her eyes. "I don't feel any lassitude," she explained,
LINE 661: "all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and come
LINE 662: back after romping about for a while."
LINE 663: "Where can I go?" Pao-yü asked as he pushed her. "I'm quite sick and
LINE 664: tired of seeing the others."
LINE 665: At these words, Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of Ch'ih. "Well!
LINE 666: since you wish to remain here," she added, "go over there and sit down
LINE 667: quietly, and let's have a chat."
LINE 668: "I'll also recline," Pao-yü suggested.
LINE 669: "Well, then, recline!" Tai-yü assented.
LINE 670: "There's no pillow," observed Pao-yü, "so let us lie on the same
LINE 671: pillow."
LINE 672: "What nonsense!" Tai-yü urged, "aren't those pillows outside? get one
LINE 673: and lie on it."
LINE 674: Pao-yü walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he
LINE 675: returned and remarked with a smile: "I don't want those, they may be,
LINE 676: for aught I know, some dirty old hag's."
LINE 677: Tai-yü at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herself
LINE 678: up: "You're really," she exclaimed laughingly, "the evil star of my
LINE 679: existence! here, please recline on this pillow!" and as she uttered
LINE 680: these words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-yü, and, getting up
LINE 681: she went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head in
LINE 682: such a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. But
LINE 683: Tai-yü, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-yü's cheek
LINE 684: on the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a
LINE 685: button, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing
LINE 686: it with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. "Whose nail," she went on
LINE 687: to inquire, "has scratched this open?"
LINE 688: Pao-yü with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he
LINE 689: did so, he answered with a smile: "It isn't a scratch; it must, I
LINE 690: presume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just
LINE 691: now mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them."
LINE 692: Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but
LINE 693: Tai-yü used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: "Do
LINE 694: you still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but
LINE 695: must you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle
LINE 696: mayn't see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a
LINE 697: strange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry
LINE 698: favour, and when it has reached uncle's ear, we shall all again not come
LINE 699: out clean, and provoke him to anger."
LINE 700: Pao-yü did not in the least heed what she said, being intent upon
LINE 701: smelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-yü's
LINE 702: sleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones.
LINE 703: With a snatch, Pao-yü laid hold of Tai-yü's sleeve meaning to see what
LINE 704: object was concealed in it; but Tai-yü smilingly expostulated: "At such
LINE 705: a time as this," she said, "who keeps scents about one?"
LINE 706: "Well, in that case," Pao-yü rejoined with a smirking face, "where does
LINE 707: this scent come from?"
LINE 708: "I myself don't know," Tai-yü replied; "I presume it must be, there's no
LINE 709: saying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes."
LINE 710: "It doesn't follow," Pao-yü added, as he shook his head; "the fumes of
LINE 711: this smell are very peculiar, and don't resemble the perfume of
LINE 712: scent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!"
LINE 713: "Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples," Tai-yü
LINE 714: asked laughing ironically, "or worthies to give me novel kinds of
LINE 715: scents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven't,
LINE 716: at all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds,
LINE 717: dew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those common
LINE 718: scents, that's all."
LINE 719: "Whenever I utter any single remark," Pao-yü urged with a grin, "you at
LINE 720: once bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with you
LINE 721: severely, you'll never know what stuff I'm made of; but from henceforth
LINE 722: I'll no more show you any grace!"
LINE 723: As he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed a
LINE 724: couple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out,
LINE 725: he tickled Tai-yü promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides.
LINE 726: Tai-yü had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-yü put
LINE 727: out his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled to
LINE 728: such an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. "If you still go
LINE 729: on teasing me," she shouted, "I'll get angry with you!"
LINE 730: Pao-yü then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, "Tell me," he asked,
LINE 731: "will you again come out with all those words or not?"
LINE 732: "I daren't do it again," Tai-yü smiled and adjusted her hair; adding
LINE 733: with another laugh: "I may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm'
LINE 734: scents?"
LINE 735: Pao-yü at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: "What
LINE 736: 'warm' scent?" he therefore asked.
LINE 737: Tai-yü nodded her head and smiled deridingly. "How stupid! what a fool!"
LINE 738: she sighed; "you have jade, and another person has gold to match with
LINE 739: you, and if some one has 'cold' scent, haven't you any 'warm' scent as a
LINE 740: set-off?"
LINE 741: Pao-yü at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.
LINE 742: "A short while back you craved for mercy," Pao-yü observed smilingly,
LINE 743: "and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;" and as he spoke
LINE 744: he again put out his hands.
LINE 745: "Dear cousin," Tai-yü speedily implored with a smirk, "I won't venture
LINE 746: to do it again."
LINE 747: "As for letting you off," Pao-yü remarked laughing, "I'll readily let
LINE 748: you off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!" and while
LINE 749: uttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it
LINE 750: against his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-yü drew
LINE 751: her hand away and urged: "You must be going now!"
LINE 752: "Though you may wish me to go, I can't," Pao-yü smiled, "so let us now
LINE 753: lie down with all propriety and have a chat," laying himself down again,
LINE 754: as he spoke, while Tai-yü likewise reclined, and covered her face with
LINE 755: her handkerchief. Pao-yü in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of
LINE 756: nonsense, which Tai-yü did not heed, and Pao-yü went on to inquire: "How
LINE 757: old she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities
LINE 758: she saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang
LINE 759: Chou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?"
LINE 760: Tai-yü made no reply; and Pao-yü fearing lest she should go to sleep,
LINE 761: and get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. "Ai yah!"
LINE 762: he exclaimed, "at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, has
LINE 763: occurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?"
LINE 764: Tai-yü perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correct
LINE 765: and his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a true
LINE 766: story, and she therefore inquired what it was?
LINE 767: Pao-yü upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh,
LINE 768: and, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. "At Yang Chou," he
LINE 769: said, "there's a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands a
LINE 770: cave called the Lin Tzu."
LINE 771: "This must all be lies," Tai-yü answered sneeringly, "as I've never
LINE 772: before heard of such a hill."
LINE 773: "Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers," Pao-yü rejoined, "and
LINE 774: how could you know them all? Wait until I've done speaking, when you
LINE 775: will be free to express your opinion!"
LINE 776: "Go on then," Tai-yü suggested, whereupon Pao-yü prosecuted his
LINE 777: raillery. "In this Lin Tzu cave," he said, "there was once upon a time a
LINE 778: whole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh day
LINE 779: of the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters.
LINE 780: 'Tomorrow,' he argued, 'is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men in
LINE 781: the world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfth
LINE 782: moon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, and
LINE 783: it would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a few
LINE 784: and bring them over.' Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to a
LINE 785: small rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. The
LINE 786: young rat on his return reported that he had already concluded his
LINE 787: search and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the temple
LINE 788: at the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits and
LINE 789: rice. 'How many kinds of rice are there?' the old rat ascertained, 'and
LINE 790: how many species of fruits?' 'Rice and beans,' the young rat rejoined,
LINE 791: 'how many barns-full there are, I can't remember; but in the way of
LINE 792: fruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, ground
LINE 793: nuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.' At this report the
LINE 794: old rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth;
LINE 795: and as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and steal
LINE 796: the rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice.
LINE 797: Drawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract the
LINE 798: beans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal the
LINE 799: beans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started on
LINE 800: his errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking again
LINE 801: a mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros:
LINE 802: whereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. 'I
LINE 803: would like,' he said, 'to go and steal the scented taros.' The old rat
LINE 804: and all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he would
LINE 805: not be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that he
LINE 806: was too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would not
LINE 807: allow him to proceed. 'Though I be young in years and though my frame be
LINE 808: delicate,' the wee rat expostulated, 'my devices are unlimited, my talk
LINE 809: is glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, on
LINE 810: this errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.'
LINE 811: 'How could you be more ingenious than they?' the whole company of rats
LINE 812: asked. 'I won't,' explained the young rat, 'follow their example, and go
LINE 813: straight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, and
LINE 814: transforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and roll
LINE 815: myself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able to
LINE 816: detect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of the
LINE 817: magic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and little
LINE 818: by little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far more
LINE 819: ingenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?' After the
LINE 820: whole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with one
LINE 821: voice, exclaimed: 'Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art of
LINE 822: metamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourself
LINE 823: and let us see you.' At these words the young rat laughed. 'This isn't a
LINE 824: hard task!' he observed, 'wait till I transform myself.'
LINE 825: "Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out 'transform,'
LINE 826: when he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a most
LINE 827: lovely face.
LINE 828: "'You've transformed yourself into the wrong thing,' all the rats
LINE 829: promptly added deridingly; 'you said that you were to become a fruit,
LINE 830: and how is it that you've turned into a young lady?'
LINE 831: "The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: 'You
LINE 832: all lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are aware
LINE 833: of is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that the
LINE 834: young daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuine
LINE 835: scented taro.'"
LINE 836: Tai-yü having listened to this story, turned herself round and raising
LINE 837: herself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-yü: "I'll take that
LINE 838: mouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you've been
LINE 839: imposing upon me."
LINE 840: With these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-yü
LINE 841: hastened to plead for mercy. "My dear cousin," he said, "spare me; I
LINE 842: won't presume to do it again; and it's when I came to perceive this
LINE 843: perfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story."
LINE 844: "You freely indulge in abusing people," Tai-yü added with a smile, "and
LINE 845: then go on to say that it's an old story."
LINE 846: But hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight of
LINE 847: Pao-ch'ai walk in. "Who has been telling old stories?" she asked with a
LINE 848: beaming face; "do let me also hear them."
LINE 849: Tai-yü pressed her at once into a seat. "Just see for yourself who else
LINE 850: besides is here!" she smiled; "he goes in for profuse abuses and then
LINE 851: maintains that it's an old story!"
LINE 852: "Is it indeed cousin Pao-yü?" Pao-ch'ai remarked. "Well, one can't feel
LINE 853: surprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored up
LINE 854: in his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of old
LINE 855: stories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recall
LINE 856: them to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves,
LINE 857: when he should have remembered them, he couldn't after all recollect
LINE 858: what really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed so
LINE 859: cool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, at
LINE 860: this moment, he happens once again to have a memory!"
LINE 861: At these words, Tai-yü laughed. "O-mi-to-fu!" she exclaimed. "You are
LINE 862: indeed my very good cousin! But you've also (to Pao-yü) come across your
LINE 863: match. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never fail
LINE 864: or err."
LINE 865: She had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-yü's rooms
LINE 866: was heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is not
LINE 867: yet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.
