LINE 1: Upon hearing the text of the stanza, Pao-yü comprehends the Buddhistic
LINE 2: spells.
LINE 3: While the enigmas for the lanterns are being devised, Chia Cheng is
LINE 4: grieved by a prognostic.
LINE 5: Chia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Feng
LINE 6: observe that she had something to consult about with him, felt
LINE 7: constrained to halt and to inquire what it was about.
LINE 8: "On the 21st," lady Feng explained, "is cousin Hsüeh's birthday, and
LINE 9: what do you, after all, purpose doing?"
LINE 10: "Do I know what to do?" exclaimed Chia Lien; "you have made, time and
LINE 11: again, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, and
LINE 12: do you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?"
LINE 13: "Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules," lady
LINE 14: Feng expostulated; "but her present birthday is neither one of an adult
LINE 15: nor that of an infant, and that's why I would like to deliberate with
LINE 16: you!"
LINE 17: Chia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself to
LINE 18: protracted reflection. "You're indeed grown dull!" he cried; "why you've
LINE 19: a precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin's birthday
LINE 20: affords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin,
LINE 21: you can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hsüeh, and it will be
LINE 22: all right."
LINE 23: At these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. "Do you, pray, mean to
LINE 24: insinuate," she added, "that I'm not aware of even this! I too had
LINE 25: previously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old lady
LINE 26: Chia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries
LINE 27: about all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hsüeh
LINE 28: would this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday,
LINE 29: which made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the
LINE 30: dawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our
LINE 31: dowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of
LINE 32: course, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin."
LINE 33: "Well, in that case," Chia Lien suggested, "you had better make a few
LINE 34: additions to what was done for cousin Lin!"
LINE 35: "That's what I too am thinking of," lady Feng replied, "and that's why
LINE 36: I'm asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you
LINE 37: would again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you."
LINE 38: "That will do, that will do!" Chia Lien rejoined laughing, "none of
LINE 39: these sham attentions for me! So long as you don't pry into my doings it
LINE 40: will be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?"
LINE 41: With these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off. But leaving
LINE 42: him alone we shall now return to Shih Hsiang-yün. After a stay of a
LINE 43: couple of days, her intention was to go back, but dowager lady Chia
LINE 44: said: "Wait until after you have seen the theatrical performance, when
LINE 45: you can return home."
LINE 46: At this proposal, Shih Hsiang-yün felt constrained to remain, but she,
LINE 47: at the same time, despatched a servant to her home to fetch two pieces
LINE 48: of needlework, which she had in former days worked with her own hands,
LINE 49: for a birthday present for Pao-ch'ai.
LINE 50: Contrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival of
LINE 51: Pao-ch'ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and good
LINE 52: nature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she was
LINE 53: about to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributed
LINE 54: twenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her,
LINE 55: to make arrangements for a banquet and performance.
LINE 56: "A venerable senior like yourself," lady Feng thereupon smiled and
LINE 57: ventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, "is at liberty to
LINE 58: celebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, without
LINE 59: any one presuming to raise any objection; but what's the use again of
LINE 60: giving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose to
LINE 61: have it celebrated with éclat, you could, needless to say, your own self
LINE 62: have spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury of
LINE 63: yours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp and
LINE 64: mould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling us
LINE 65: to supply what's wanted! But hadn't you really been able to contribute
LINE 66: any more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver,
LINE 67: round as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down the
LINE 68: bottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extort
LINE 69: from us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn't your
LINE 70: venerable ladyship's son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that in
LINE 71: the future there will only be cousin Pao-yü to carry you, our old lady,
LINE 72: on his head, up the Wu T'ai Shan? You may keep all these things for him
LINE 73: alone! but though we mayn't at present, deserve that anything should be
LINE 74: spent upon us, you shouldn't go so far as to place us in any
LINE 75: perplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough for
LINE 76: wines, and enough for the theatricals?"
LINE 77: As she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst out
LINE 78: laughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while she
LINE 79: observed: "Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon as
LINE 80: having the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can't talk in such a
LINE 81: wise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn't dare
LINE 82: to be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber with
LINE 83: me!"
LINE 84: "My mother-in-law," explained lady Feng, "is also as fond of Pao-yü as
LINE 85: you are, so much so that I haven't anywhere I could go and give vent to
LINE 86: my grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I'm
LINE 87: overbearing in my speech!"
LINE 88: With these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for a
LINE 89: while. The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, when
LINE 90: evening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay their
LINE 91: obeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company of
LINE 92: ladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain of
LINE 93: Pao-ch'ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied to
LINE 94: eat.
LINE 95: Pao-ch'ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years though
LINE 96: she was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweet
LINE 97: and tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, to
LINE 98: those things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated a
LINE 99: whole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant.
LINE 100: And the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks and
LINE 101: such presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-yü and the other
LINE 102: girls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her,
LINE 103: regulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not allude
LINE 104: in detail.
LINE 105: When the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy,
LINE 106: was improvised in dowager lady Chia's inner court, and a troupe of young
LINE 107: actors, who had newly made their début, was retained for the nonce,
LINE 108: among whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast.
LINE 109: In the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tables
LINE 110: for a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a single
LINE 111: outside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hsüeh, Shih Hsiang-yün,
LINE 112: and Pao-ch'ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of her
LINE 113: household.
LINE 114: On this day, Pao-yü failed, at any early hour, to see anything of Lin
LINE 115: Tai-yü, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discovered
LINE 116: her reclining on the stove-couch. "Get up," Pao-yü pressed her with a
LINE 117: smile, "and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence
LINE 118: shortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so
LINE 119: that I may be able to choose them."
LINE 120: Tai-yü smiled sarcastically. "In that case," she rejoined, "you had
LINE 121: better specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for my
LINE 122: benefit; for on this occasion you can't be so impertinent as to make use
LINE 123: of their expense to ask me what I like!"
LINE 124: "What's there impossible about this?" Pao-yü answered smiling; "well,
LINE 125: to-morrow I'll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of
LINE 126: what is yours and mine."
LINE 127: As he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in his
LINE 128: own, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast. When the
LINE 129: time arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of her
LINE 130: own motion first asked Pao-ch'ai to mark off those she liked; and though
LINE 131: for a time Pao-ch'ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had no
LINE 132: alternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, "the Record of the
LINE 133: Western Tour," a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Next
LINE 134: in order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, in
LINE 135: spite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider old
LINE 136: lady Chia's request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by any
LINE 137: disobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had a
LINE 138: penchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial to
LINE 139: jests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery, she therefore hastened to
LINE 140: precede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no other
LINE 141: than "Liu Erh pawns his clothes."
LINE 142: Dowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this she
LINE 143: speedily went on to ask Tai-yü to choose. Tai-yü likewise concedingly
LINE 144: yielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to make
LINE 145: their selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. "To-day,"
LINE 146: she said, "is primarily an occasion, on which I've brought all of you
LINE 147: here for your special recreation; and we had better look after our own
LINE 148: selves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to the
LINE 149: trouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their special
LINE 150: benefit? they're already reaping benefit enough by being in here,
LINE 151: listening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have no
LINE 152: right to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice of
LINE 153: plays?"
LINE 154: At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which,
LINE 155: Tai-yü, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-yü,
LINE 156: Shih Hsiang-yün, Ying-ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, widow Li Wan, and
LINE 157: the rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung
LINE 158: in the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their
LINE 159: places at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch'ai make another
LINE 160: selection, and Pao-ch'ai cast her choice upon the play: "Lu Chih-shen,
LINE 161: in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T'ai mountain;"
LINE 162: whereupon Pao-yü interposed, with the remark: "All you fancy is to
LINE 163: choose plays of this kind;" to which Pao-ch'ai rejoined, "You've
LINE 164: listened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the
LINE 165: beauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still
LINE 166: better are the apt and elegant passages in it."
LINE 167: "I've always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!" Pao-yü
LINE 168: retorted.
LINE 169: "If you call this play sensational," Pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated,
LINE 170: "well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of
LINE 171: plays. But come over and I'll tell you. This play constitutes one of a
LINE 172: set of books, entitled the 'Pei Tien Peng Ch'un,' which, as far as
LINE 173: harmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes without
LINE 174: saying, perfect; but there's among the elegant compositions a ballad
LINE 175: entitled: 'the Parasitic Plant,' written in a most excellent style; but
LINE 176: how could you know anything about it?"
LINE 177: Pao-yü, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drew
LINE 178: near to her. "My dear cousin," he entreated, "recite it and let me hear
LINE 179: it!" Whereupon Pao-ch'ai went on as follows:
LINE 180: My manly tears I will not wipe away,
LINE 181: But from this place, the scholar's home, I'll stray.
LINE 182: The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my
LINE 183: pate;
LINE 184: With Yüan to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate,
LINE 185: And needy and forlorn I'll come and go, with none to care about my
LINE 186: fate.
LINE 187: Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my
LINE 188: warrant I shall roll,
LINE 189: And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my
LINE 190: fate may be, I'll stroll.
LINE 191: As soon as Pao-yü had listened to her recital, he was so full of
LINE 192: enthusiasm, that, clapping his knees with his hands, and shaking his
LINE 193: head, he gave vent to incessant praise; after which he went on to extol
LINE 194: Pao-ch'ai, saying: "There's no book that you don't know."
LINE 195: "Be quiet, and listen to the play," Lin Tai-yü urged; "they haven't yet
LINE 196: sung about the mountain gate, and you already pretend to be mad!"
LINE 197: At these words, Hsiang-yün also laughed. But, in due course, the whole
LINE 198: party watched the performance until evening, when they broke up. Dowager
LINE 199: lady Chia was so very much taken with the young actor, who played the
LINE 200: role of a lady, as well as with the one who acted the buffoon, that she
LINE 201: gave orders that they should be brought in; and, as she looked at them
LINE 202: closely, she felt so much the more interest in them, that she went on to
LINE 203: inquire what their ages were. And when the would-be lady (replied) that
LINE 204: he was just eleven, while the would-be buffoon (explained) that he was
LINE 205: just nine, the whole company gave vent for a time to expressions of
LINE 206: sympathy with their lot; while dowager lady Chia bade servants bring a
LINE 207: fresh supply of meats and fruits for both of them, and also gave them,
LINE 208: besides their wages, two tiaos as a present.
LINE 209: "This lad," lady Feng observed smiling, "is when dressed up (as a girl),
LINE 210: a living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?"
LINE 211: Pao-ch'ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her head
LINE 212: assentingly and did not say who it was. Pao-yü likewise expressed his
LINE 213: assent by shaking his head, but he too did not presume to speak out.
LINE 214: Shih Hsiang-yün, however, readily took up the conversation. "He
LINE 215: resembles," she interposed, "cousin Lin's face!" When this remark
LINE 216: reached Pao-yü's ear, he hastened to cast an angry scowl at Hsiang-yün,
LINE 217: and to make her a sign; while the whole party, upon hearing what had
LINE 218: been said, indulged in careful and minute scrutiny of (the lad); and as
LINE 219: they all began to laugh: "The resemblance is indeed striking!" they
LINE 220: exclaimed.
LINE 221: After a while, they parted; and when evening came Hsiang-yün directed
LINE 222: Ts'ui Lü to pack up her clothes.
LINE 223: "What's the hurry?" Ts'ui Lü asked. "There will be ample time to pack
LINE 224: up, on the day on which we go!"
LINE 225: "We'll go to-morrow," Hsiang-yün rejoined; "for what's the use of
LINE 226: remaining here any longer--to look at people's mouths and faces?"
LINE 227: Pao-yü, at these words, lost no time in pressing forward.
LINE 228: "My dear cousin," he urged; "you're wrong in bearing me a grudge! My
LINE 229: cousin Lin is a girl so very touchy, that though every one else
LINE 230: distinctly knew (of the resemblance), they wouldn't speak out; and all
LINE 231: because they were afraid that she would get angry; but unexpectedly out
LINE 232: you came with it, at a moment when off your guard; and how ever couldn't
LINE 233: she but feel hurt? and it's because I was in dread that you would give
LINE 234: offence to people that I then winked at you; and now here you are angry
LINE 235: with me; but isn't that being ungrateful to me? Had it been any one
LINE 236: else, would I have cared whether she had given offence to even ten; that
LINE 237: would have been none of my business!"
LINE 238: Hsiang-yün waved her hand: "Don't," she added, "come and tell me these
LINE 239: flowery words and this specious talk, for I really can't come up to your
LINE 240: cousin Lin. If others poke fun at her, they all do so with impunity,
LINE 241: while if I say anything, I at once incur blame. The fact is I shouldn't
LINE 242: have spoken of her, undeserving as I am; and as she's the daughter of a
LINE 243: master, while I'm a slave, a mere servant girl, I've heaped insult upon
LINE 244: her!"
LINE 245: "And yet," pleaded Pao-yü, full of perplexity, "I had done it for your
LINE 246: sake; and through this, I've come in for reproach. But if it were with
LINE 247: an evil heart I did so, may I at once become ashes, and be trampled upon
LINE 248: by ten thousands of people!"
LINE 249: "In this felicitous firstmonth," Hsiang-yün remonstrated, "you shouldn't
LINE 250: talk so much reckless nonsense! All these worthless despicable oaths,
LINE 251: disjointed words, and corrupt language, go and tell for the benefit of
LINE 252: those mean sort of people, who in everything take pleasure in irritating
LINE 253: others, and who keep you under their thumb! But mind don't drive me to
LINE 254: spit contemptuously at you."
LINE 255: As she gave utterance to these words, she betook herself in the inner
LINE 256: room of dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments, where she lay down in
LINE 257: high dudgeon, and, as Pao-yü was so heavy at heart, he could not help
LINE 258: coming again in search of Tai-yü; but strange to say, as soon as he put
LINE 259: his foot inside the doorway, he was speedily hustled out of it by
LINE 260: Tai-yü, who shut the door in his face.
LINE 261: Pao-yü was once more unable to fathom her motives, and as he stood
LINE 262: outside the window, he kept on calling out: "My dear cousin," in a low
LINE 263: tone of voice; but Tai-yü paid not the slightest notice to him so that
LINE 264: Pao-yü became so melancholy that he drooped his head, and was plunged in
LINE 265: silence. And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know the
LINE 266: circumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender any
LINE 267: advice.
LINE 268: Pao-yü remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-yü imagined that
LINE 269: he had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight of
LINE 270: Pao-yü still waiting in there; and as Tai-yü did not feel justified to
LINE 271: again close the door, Pao-yü consequently followed her in.
LINE 272: "Every thing has," he observed, "a why and a wherefore; which, when
LINE 273: spoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,
LINE 274: and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?"
LINE 275: "It's well enough, after all, for you to ask me," Tai-yü rejoined with
LINE 276: an indifferent smile, "but I myself don't know why! But am I here to
LINE 277: afford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and
LINE 278: make the whole lot have a laugh at me?"
LINE 279: "I never did liken you to anything," Pao-yü protested, "neither did I
LINE 280: ever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?"
LINE 281: "Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the
LINE 282: comparison," Tai-yü urged, "and was there any need of even any laughter
LINE 283: from you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had a
LINE 284: laugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did
LINE 285: compare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!"
LINE 286: Pao-yü could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had
LINE 287: just heard, and Tai-yü went on to say. "This offence can, anyhow, be
LINE 288: condoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Yün Erh? What was
LINE 289: this idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn't it perhaps that if
LINE 290: she played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herself
LINE 291: cheap? She's the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth the
LINE 292: mean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she diverted
LINE 293: herself with me, wouldn't she have exposed herself to being depreciated,
LINE 294: had I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your idea
LINE 295: wasn't it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, that
LINE 296: girl wouldn't, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry with
LINE 297: you just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do you
LINE 298: a good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I'm mean by nature and
LINE 299: take pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again were
LINE 300: afraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row with
LINE 301: her, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence,
LINE 302: what concern would that too have been of yours?"
LINE 303: When Pao-yü heard these words, he at once became alive to the fact that
LINE 304: she too had lent an ear to the private conversation he had had a short
LINE 305: while back with Hsiang-yün: "All because of my, fears," he carefully
LINE 306: mused within himself, "lest these two should have a misunderstanding, I
LINE 307: was induced to come between them, and act as a mediator; but I myself
LINE 308: have, contrary to my hopes, incurred blame and abuse on both sides! This
LINE 309: just accords with what I read the other day in the Nan Hua Ching. 'The
LINE 310: ingenious toil, the wise are full of care; the good-for-nothing seek for
LINE 311: nothing, they feed on vegetables, and roam where they list; they wander
LINE 312: purposeless like a boat not made fast!' 'The mountain trees,' the text
LINE 313: goes on to say, 'lead to their own devastation; the spring (conduces) to
LINE 314: its own plunder; and so on." And the more he therefore indulged in
LINE 315: reflection, the more depressed he felt. "Now there are only these few
LINE 316: girls," he proceeded to ponder minutely, "and yet, I'm unable to treat
LINE 317: them in such a way as to promote perfect harmony; and what will I
LINE 318: forsooth do by and by (when there will be more to deal with)!"
LINE 319: When he had reached this point in his cogitations, (he decided) that it
LINE 320: was really of no avail to agree with her, so that turning round, he was
LINE 321: making his way all alone into his apartments; but Lin Tai-yü, upon
LINE 322: noticing that he had left her side, readily concluded that reflection
LINE 323: had marred his spirits and that he had so thoroughly lost his temper as
LINE 324: to be going without even giving vent to a single word, and she could not
LINE 325: restrain herself from feeling inwardly more and more irritated. "After
LINE 326: you've gone this time," she hastily exclaimed, "don't come again, even
LINE 327: for a whole lifetime; and I won't have you either so much as speak to
LINE 328: me!"
LINE 329: Pao-yü paid no heed to her, but came back to his rooms, and laying
LINE 330: himself down on his bed, he kept on muttering in a state of chagrin; and
LINE 331: though Hsi Jen knew full well the reasons of his dejection, she found it
LINE 332: difficult to summon up courage to say anything to him at the moment, and
LINE 333: she had no alternative but to try and distract him by means of
LINE 334: irrelevant matters. "The theatricals which you've seen to-day," she
LINE 335: consequently observed smiling, "will again lead to performances for
LINE 336: several days, and Miss Pao-ch'ai will, I'm sure, give a return feast."
LINE 337: "Whether she gives a return feast or not," Pao-yü rejoined with an
LINE 338: apathetic smirk, "is no concern of mine!"
LINE 339: When Hsi Jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, with
LINE 340: which these words were pronounced: "What's this that you're saying?" she
LINE 341: therefore remarked as she gave another smile. "In this pleasant and
LINE 342: propitious first moon, when all the ladies and young ladies are in high
LINE 343: glee, how is it that you're again in a mood of this sort?"
LINE 344: "Whether the ladies and my cousins be in high spirits or not," Pao-yü
LINE 345: replied forcing a grin, "is also perfectly immaterial to me."
LINE 346: "They are all," Hsi Jen added, smilingly, "pleasant and agreeable, and
LINE 347: were you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn't it conduce to
LINE 348: the enjoyment of the whole company?"
LINE 349: "What about the whole company, and they and I?" Pao-yü urged. "They all
LINE 350: have their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, have
LINE 351: none to care a rap for me."
LINE 352: His remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tears
LINE 353: trickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, did
LINE 354: not venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-yü had reflected
LINE 355: minutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could not
LINE 356: refrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turning
LINE 357: himself round, he stood up, and, drawing near the table, he took up the
LINE 358: pencil, and eagerly composed these enigmatical lines:
LINE 359: If thou wert me to test, and I were thee to test,
LINE 360: Our hearts were we to test, and our minds to test,
LINE 361: When naught more there remains for us to test
LINE 362: That will yea very well be called a test,
LINE 363: And when there's naught to put, we could say, to the test,
LINE 364: We will a place set up on which our feet to rest.
LINE 365: After he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though he
LINE 366: himself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse these
LINE 367: lines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went on
LINE 368: consequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the "Parasitic
LINE 369: Plant," which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he had
LINE 370: read it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concern
LINE 371: that forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.
LINE 372: But, who would have thought it, Tai-yü, upon seeing Pao-yü take his
LINE 373: departure in such an abrupt manner, designedly made use of the excuse
LINE 374: that she was bent upon finding Hsi Jen, to come round and see what he
LINE 375: was up to.
LINE 376: "He's gone to sleep long ago!" Hsi Jen replied.
LINE 377: At these words, Tai-yü felt inclined to betake herself back at once; but
LINE 378: Hsi Jen smiled and said: "Please stop, miss. Here's a slip of paper, and
LINE 379: see what there is on it!" and speedily taking what Pao-yü had written a
LINE 380: short while back, she handed it over to Tai-yü to examine. Tai-yü, on
LINE 381: perusal, discovered that Pao-yü had composed it, at the spur of the
LINE 382: moment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not help
LINE 383: thinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but she
LINE 384: hastily explained to Hsi Jen: "This is written for fun, and there's
LINE 385: nothing of any consequence in it!" and having concluded this remark, she
LINE 386: readily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over in
LINE 387: company with Hsiang-yün; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch'ai to
LINE 388: peruse. The burden of what Pao-ch'ai read was:
LINE 389: In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,
LINE 390: For while I humour this, that one to please I don't succeed!
LINE 391: Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to
LINE 392: me.
LINE 393: Sorrow or joy, without limit or bound, to indulge thou art free!
LINE 394: What is this hazy notion about relatives distant or close?
LINE 395: For what purpose have I for all these days racked my heart with woes?
LINE 396: Even at this time when I look back and think, my mind no pleasure
LINE 397: knows.
LINE 398: After having finished its perusal, she went on to glance at the
LINE 399: Buddhistic stanza, and smiling: "This being," she soliloquised; "has
LINE 400: awakened to a sense of perception; and all through my fault, for it's
LINE 401: that ballad of mine yesterday which has incited this! But the subtle
LINE 402: devices in all these rationalistic books have a most easy tendency to
LINE 403: unsettle the natural disposition, and if to-morrow he does actually get
LINE 404: up, and talk a lot of insane trash, won't his having fostered this idea
LINE 405: owe its origin to that ballad of mine; and shan't I have become the
LINE 406: prime of all guilty people?"
LINE 407: Saying this, she promptly tore the paper, and, delivering the pieces to
LINE 408: the servant girls, she bade them go at once and burn them.
LINE 409: "You shouldn't have torn it!" Tai-yü remonstrated laughingly. "But wait
LINE 410: and I'll ask him about it! so come along all of you, and I vouch I'll
LINE 411: make him abandon that idiotic frame of mind and that depraved language."
LINE 412: The three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into Pao-yü's room,
LINE 413: and Tai-yü was the first to smile and observe. "Pao-yü, may I ask you
LINE 414: something? What is most valuable is a precious thing; and what is most
LINE 415: firm is jade, but what value do you possess and what firmness is innate
LINE 416: in you?"
LINE 417: But as Pao-yü could not, say anything by way of reply, two of them
LINE 418: remarked sneeringly: "With all this doltish bluntness of his will he
LINE 419: after all absorb himself in abstraction?" While Hsiang-yün also clapped
LINE 420: her hands and laughed, "Cousin Pao has been discomfited."
LINE 421: "The latter part of that apothegm of yours," Tai-yü continued, "says:
LINE 422: "We would then find some place on which our feet to rest.
LINE 423: "Which is certainly good; but in my view, its excellence is not as yet
LINE 424: complete! and I should still tag on two lines at its close;" as she
LINE 425: proceeded to recite:
LINE 426: "If we do not set up some place on which our feet to rest,
LINE 427: For peace and freedom then it will be best."
LINE 428: "There should, in very truth, be this adjunct to make it thoroughly
LINE 429: explicit!" Pao-ch'ai added. "In days of yore, the sixth founder of the
LINE 430: Southern sect, Hui Neng, came, when he went first in search of his
LINE 431: patron, in the Shao Chou district; and upon hearing that the fifth
LINE 432: founder, Hung Jen, was at Huang Mei, he readily entered his service in
LINE 433: the capacity of Buddhist cook; and when the fifth founder, prompted by a
LINE 434: wish to select a Buddhistic successor, bade his neophytes and all the
LINE 435: bonzes to each compose an enigmatical stanza, the one who occupied the
LINE 436: upper seat, Shen Hsiu, recited:
LINE 437: "A P'u T'i tree the body is, the heart so like a stand of mirror
LINE 438: bright,
LINE 439: On which must needs, by constant careful rubbing, not be left dust to
LINE 440: alight!
LINE 441: "And Hui Neng, who was at this time in the cook-house pounding rice,
LINE 442: overheard this enigma. 'Excellent, it is excellent,' he ventured, 'but
LINE 443: as far as completeness goes it isn't complete;' and having bethought
LINE 444: himself of an apothegm: 'The P'u T'i, (an expression for Buddha or
LINE 445: intelligence),' he proceeded, 'is really no tree; and the resplendent
LINE 446: mirror, (Buddhistic term for heart), is likewise no stand; and as, in
LINE 447: fact, they do not constitute any tangible objects, how could they be
LINE 448: contaminated by particles of dust?' Whereupon the fifth founder at once
LINE 449: took his robe and clap-dish and handed them to him. Well, the text now
LINE 450: of this enigma presents too this identical idea, for the simple fact is
LINE 451: that those lines full of subtleties of a short while back are not, as
LINE 452: yet, perfected or brought to an issue, and do you forsooth readily give
LINE 453: up the task in this manner?"
LINE 454: "He hasn't been able to make any reply," Tai-yü rejoined sneeringly,
LINE 455: "and must therefore be held to be discomfited; but were he even to make
LINE 456: suitable answer now, there would be nothing out of the common about it!
LINE 457: Anyhow, from this time forth you mustn't talk about Buddhistic spells,
LINE 458: for what even we two know and are able to do, you don't as yet know and
LINE 459: can't do; and do you go and concern yourself with abstraction?"
LINE 460: Pao-yü had, in his own mind, been under the impression that he had
LINE 461: attained perception, but when he was unawares and all of a sudden
LINE 462: subjected to this question by Tai-yü, he soon found it beyond his power
LINE 463: to give any ready answer. And when Pao-ch'ai furthermore came out with a
LINE 464: religious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, in
LINE 465: all of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, he
LINE 466: communed within himself: "If with their knowledge, which is indeed in
LINE 467: advance of that of mine, they haven't, as yet, attained perception, what
LINE 468: need is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?"
LINE 469: "Who has, pray," he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at the
LINE 470: end of his reflections, "indulged in Buddhistic mysteries? what I did
LINE 471: amounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur of
LINE 472: the moment, and nothing else."
LINE 473: At the close of this remark all four came to be again on the same terms
LINE 474: as of old; but suddenly a servant announced that the Empress (Yüan
LINE 475: Ch'un) had despatched a messenger to bring over a lantern-conundrum with
LINE 476: the directions that they should all go and guess it, and that after they
LINE 477: had found it out, they should each also devise one and send it in. At
LINE 478: these words, the four of them left the room with hasty step, and
LINE 479: adjourned into dowager lady Chia's drawing room, where they discovered a
LINE 480: young eunuch, holding a four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, of white
LINE 481: gauze, which had been specially fabricated for lantern riddles. On the
LINE 482: front side, there was already a conundrum, and the whole company were
LINE 483: vying with each other in looking at it and making wild guesses; when the
LINE 484: young eunuch went on to transmit his orders, saying: "Young ladies, you
LINE 485: should not speak out when you are guessing; but each one of you should
LINE 486: secretly write down the solutions for me to wrap them up, and take them
LINE 487: all in together to await her Majesty's personal inspection as to whether
LINE 488: they be correct or not."
LINE 489: Upon listening to these words, Pao-ch'ai drew near, and perceived at a
LINE 490: glance, that it consisted of a stanza of four lines, with seven
LINE 491: characters in each; but though there was no novelty or remarkable
LINE 492: feature about it, she felt constrained to outwardly give utterance to
LINE 493: words of praise. "It's hard to guess!" she simply added, while she
LINE 494: pretended to be plunged in thought, for the fact is that as soon as she
LINE 495: had cast her eye upon it, she had at once solved it. Pao-yü, Tai-yü,
LINE 496: Hsiang-yün, and T'an-ch'un, had all four also hit upon the answer, and
LINE 497: each had secretly put it in writing; and Chia Huan, Chia Lan and the
LINE 498: others were at the same time sent for, and every one of them set to work
LINE 499: to exert the energies of his mind, and, when they arrived at a guess,
LINE 500: they noted it down on paper; after which every individual member of the
LINE 501: family made a choice of some object, and composed a riddle, which was
LINE 502: transcribed in a large round hand, and affixed on the lantern. This
LINE 503: done, the eunuch took his departure, and when evening drew near, he came
LINE 504: out and delivered the commands of the imperial consort. "The conundrum,"
LINE 505: he said, "written by Her Highness, the other day, has been solved by
LINE 506: every one, with the exception of Miss Secunda and master Tertius, who
LINE 507: made a wrong guess. Those composed by you, young ladies, have likewise
LINE 508: all been guessed; but Her Majesty does not know whether her solutions
LINE 509: are right or not." While speaking, he again produced the riddles, which
LINE 510: had been written by them, among which were those which had been solved,
LINE 511: as well as those which had not been solved; and the eunuch, in like
LINE 512: manner, took the presents, conferred by the imperial consort, and handed
LINE 513: them over to those who had guessed right. To each person was assigned a
LINE 514: bamboo vase, inscribed with verses, which had been manufactured for
LINE 515: palace use, as well as articles of bamboo for tea; with the exception of
LINE 516: Ying-ch'un and Chia Huan, who were the only two persons who did not
LINE 517: receive any. But as Ying-ch'un looked upon the whole thing as a joke and
LINE 518: a trifle, she did not trouble her mind on that score, but Chia Huan at
LINE 519: once felt very disconsolate.
LINE 520: "This one devised by Mr. Tertius," the eunuch was further heard to say,
LINE 521: "is not properly done; and as Her Majesty herself has been unable to
LINE 522: guess it she commanded me to bring it back, and ask Mr. Tertius what it
LINE 523: is about."
LINE 524: After the party had listened to these words, they all pressed forward to
LINE 525: see what had been written. The burden of it was this:
LINE 526: The elder brother has horns only eight;
LINE 527: The second brother has horns only two;
LINE 528: The elder brother on the bed doth sit;
LINE 529: Inside the room the second likes to squat.
LINE 530: After perusal of these lines, they broke out, with one voice, into a
LINE 531: loud fit of laughter; and Chia Huan had to explain to the eunuch that
LINE 532: the one was a pillow, and the other the head of an animal. Having
LINE 533: committed the explanation to memory and accepted a cup of tea, the
LINE 534: eunuch took his departure; and old lady Chia, noticing in what buoyant
LINE 535: spirits Yüan Ch'un was, felt herself so much the more elated, that
LINE 536: issuing forthwith directions to devise, with every despatch, a small but
LINE 537: ingenious lantern of fine texture in the shape of a screen, and put it
LINE 538: in the Hall, she bade each of her grandchildren secretly compose a
LINE 539: conundrum, copy it out clean, and affix it on the frame of the lantern;
LINE 540: and she had subsequently scented tea and fine fruits, as well as every
LINE 541: kind of nicknacks, got ready, as prizes for those who guessed right.
LINE 542: And when Chia Cheng came from court and found the old lady in such high
LINE 543: glee he also came over in the evening, as the season was furthermore
LINE 544: holiday time, to avail himself of her good cheer to reap some enjoyment.
LINE 545: In the upper part of the room seated themselves, at one table dowager
LINE 546: lady Chia, Chia Cheng, and Pao-yü; madame Wang, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yü,
LINE 547: Hsiang-yün sat round another table, and Ying-ch'un, Tan-ch'un and Hsi
LINE 548: Ch'un the three of them, occupied a separate table, and both these
LINE 549: tables were laid in the lower part, while below, all over the floor,
LINE 550: stood matrons and waiting-maids for Li Kung-ts'ai and Hsi-feng were both
LINE 551: seated in the inner section of the Hall, at another table.
LINE 552: Chia Chen failed to see Chia Lan, and he therefore inquired: "How is it
LINE 553: I don't see brother Lan," whereupon the female servants, standing below,
LINE 554: hastily entered the inner room and made inquiries of widow Li. "He
LINE 555: says," Mrs. Li stood up and rejoined with a smile, "that as your master
LINE 556: didn't go just then to ask him round, he has no wish to come!" and when
LINE 557: a matron delivered the reply to Chia Cheng; the whole company exclaimed
LINE 558: much amused: "How obstinate and perverse his natural disposition is!"
LINE 559: But Chia Cheng lost no time in sending Chia Huan, together with two
LINE 560: matrons, to fetch Chia Lan; and, on his arrival, dowager lady Chia bade
LINE 561: him sit by her side, and, taking a handful of fruits, she gave them to
LINE 562: him to eat; after which the party chatted, laughed, and enjoyed
LINE 563: themselves.
LINE 564: Ordinarily, there was no one but Pao-yü to say much or talk at any
LINE 565: length, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks were
LINE 566: limited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-yün had, though a young
LINE 567: girl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond of
LINE 568: talking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at the
LINE 569: feast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As for
LINE 570: Tai-yü she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very much
LINE 571: inclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch'ai, who had never been
LINE 572: reckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behaved
LINE 573: on the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was that
LINE 574: this banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation,
LINE 575: assumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chia
LINE 576: was herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence of
LINE 577: Chia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round three
LINE 578: times, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest.
LINE 579: No less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady's motives in
LINE 580: packing him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the young
LINE 581: ladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing a
LINE 582: smile, he observed: "Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyship
LINE 583: had got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on the
LINE 584: occasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently prepared
LINE 585: prizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose of
LINE 586: joining the company; and why don't you in some way confer a fraction of
LINE 587: the fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters,
LINE 588: upon me also, your son?"
LINE 589: "When you're here," old lady Chia replied smilingly, "they won't venture
LINE 590: to chat or laugh; and unless you go, you'll really fill me with intense
LINE 591: dejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I'll tell
LINE 592: you one for you to solve; but if you don't guess right, mind, you'll be
LINE 593: mulcted!"
LINE 594: "Of course I'll submit to the penalty," Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, as
LINE 595: he laughed, "but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a
LINE 596: reward!"
LINE 597: "This goes without saying!" dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went
LINE 598: on to recite:
LINE 599: The monkey's body gently rests on the tree top!
LINE 600: "This refers," she said, "to the name of a fruit."
LINE 601: Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly
LINE 602: made a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he
LINE 603: subsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a
LINE 604: present from her ladyship.
LINE 605: In due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia to
LINE 606: guess:
LINE 607: Correct its body is in appearance,
LINE 608: Both firm and solid is it in substance;
LINE 609: To words, it is true, it cannot give vent,
LINE 610: But spoken to, it always does assent.
LINE 611: When he had done reciting it, he communicated the answer in an undertone
LINE 612: to Pao-yü; and Pao-yü fathoming what his intention was, gently too told
LINE 613: his grandmother Chia, and her ladyship finding, after some reflection,
LINE 614: that there was really no mistake about it, readily remarked that it was
LINE 615: an inkslab.
LINE 616: "After all," Chia Cheng smiled; "Your venerable ladyship it is who can
LINE 617: hit the right answer with one guess!" and turning his head round, "Be
LINE 618: quick," he cried, "and bring the prizes and present them!" whereupon the
LINE 619: married women and waiting-maids below assented with one voice, and they
LINE 620: simultaneously handed up the large trays and small boxes.
LINE 621: Old lady Chia passed the things, one by one, under inspection; and
LINE 622: finding that they consisted of various kinds of articles, novel and
LINE 623: ingenious, of use and of ornament, in vogue during the lantern festival,
LINE 624: her heart was so deeply elated that with alacrity she shouted, "Pour a
LINE 625: glass of wine for your master!"
LINE 626: Pao-yü took hold of the decanter, while Ying Ch'un presented the cup of
LINE 627: wine.
LINE 628: "Look on that screen!" continued dowager lady Chia, "all those riddles
LINE 629: have been written by the young ladies; so go and guess them for my
LINE 630: benefit!"
LINE 631: Chia Cheng signified his obedience, and rising and walking up to the
LINE 632: front of the screen, he noticed the first riddle, which was one composed
LINE 633: by the Imperial consort Yüan, in this strain:
LINE 634: The pluck of devils to repress in influence it abounds,
LINE 635: Like bound silk is its frame, and like thunder its breath resounds.
LINE 636: But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread;
LINE 637: Transformed to ashes 'tis what time to see you turn the head.
LINE 638: "Is this a cracker?" Chia Cheng inquired.
LINE 639: "It is," Pao-yü assented.
LINE 640: Chia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch'un's, which referred
LINE 641: to an article of use:
LINE 642: Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human
LINE 643: skill;
LINE 644: Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard
LINE 645: yet
LINE 646: will be!
LINE 647: Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?
LINE 648: Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.
LINE 649: "It's an abacus," Chia Cheng observed.
LINE 650: "Quite so!" replied Ying Ch'un smiling; after which they also conned the
LINE 651: one below, by T'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with an
LINE 652: object:
LINE 653: This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!
LINE 654: The term of "pure brightness" is the meetest time this thing to make!
LINE 655: The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!
LINE 656: The East wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!
LINE 657: "It would seem," Chia Cheng suggested, "as if that must be a kite!"
LINE 658: "It is," answered T'an C'h'un; whereupon Chia Cheng read the one below,
LINE 659: which was written by Tai-yü to this effect and bore upon some thing:
LINE 660: After the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?
LINE 661: Both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!
LINE 662: The dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!
LINE 663: At midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!
LINE 664: The head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!
LINE 665: Its heart, it burns from day to day and 'gain from year to year!
LINE 666: Time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!
LINE 667: Changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!
LINE 668: "Isn't this a scented stick to show the watch?" Chia Cheng inquired.
LINE 669: "Yes!" assented Pao-yü, speaking on Tai-yü's behalf; and Chia Cheng
LINE 670: thereupon prosecuted the perusal of a conundrum, which ran as follows,
LINE 671: and referred to an object;
LINE 672: With the South, it sits face to face,
LINE 673: And the North, the while, it doth face;
LINE 674: If the figure be sad, it also is sad,
LINE 675: If the figure be glad, it likewise is glad!
LINE 676: "Splendid! splendid!" exclaimed Chia Cheng, "my guess is that it's a
LINE 677: looking-glass. It's excellently done!"
LINE 678: Pao-yü smiled. "It is a looking glass!" he rejoined.
LINE 679: "This is, however, anonymous; whose work is it?" Chia Cheng went on to
LINE 680: ask, and dowager lady Chia interposed: "This, I fancy, must have been
LINE 681: composed by Pao-yü," and Chia Cheng then said not a word, but continued
LINE 682: reading the following conundrum, which was that devised by Pao-ch'ai, on
LINE 683: some article or other:
LINE 684: Eyes though it has; eyeballs it has none, and empty 'tis inside!
LINE 685: The lotus flowers out of the water peep, and they with gladness meet,
LINE 686: But when dryandra leaves begin to drop, they then part and divide,
LINE 687: For a fond pair they are, but, united, winter they cannot greet.
LINE 688: When Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. "This
LINE 689: object," he pondered, "must surely be limited in use! But for persons of
LINE 690: tender years to indulge in all this kind of language, would seem to be
LINE 691: still less propitious; for they cannot, in my views, be any of them the
LINE 692: sort of people to enjoy happiness and longevity!" When his reflections
LINE 693: reached this point, he felt the more dejected, and plainly betrayed a
LINE 694: sad appearance, and all he did was to droop his head and to plunge in a
LINE 695: brown study.
LINE 696: But upon perceiving the frame of mind in which Chia Cheng was, dowager
LINE 697: lady Chia arrived at the conclusion that he must be fatigued; and
LINE 698: fearing, on the other hand, that if she detained him, the whole party of
LINE 699: young ladies would lack the spirit to enjoy themselves, she there and
LINE 700: then faced Chia Cheng and suggested: "There's no need really for you to
LINE 701: remain here any longer, and you had better retire to rest; and let us
LINE 702: sit a while longer; after which, we too will break up!"
LINE 703: As soon as Chia Cheng caught this hint, he speedily assented several
LINE 704: consecutive yes's; and when he had further done his best to induce old
LINE 705: lady Chia to have a cup of wine, he eventually withdrew out of the Hall.
LINE 706: On his return to his bedroom, he could do nothing else than give way to
LINE 707: cogitation, and, as he turned this and turned that over in his mind, he
LINE 708: got still more sad and pained.
LINE 709: "Amuse yourselves now!" readily exclaimed dowager lady Chia, during this
LINE 710: while, after seeing Chia Cheng off; but this remark was barely finished,
LINE 711: when she caught sight of Pao-yü run up to the lantern screen, and give
LINE 712: vent, as he gesticulated with his hands and kicked his feet about, to
LINE 713: any criticisms that first came to his lips. "In this," he remarked,
LINE 714: "this line isn't happy; and that one, hasn't been suitably solved!"
LINE 715: while he behaved just like a monkey, whose fetters had been let loose.
