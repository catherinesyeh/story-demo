LINE 1: One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
LINE 2: himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
LINE 3: armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
LINE 4: brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
LINE 5: The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off
LINE 6: any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the
LINE 7: rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
LINE 8: "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a
LINE 9: proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
LINE 10: its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
LINE 11: on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a
LINE 12: picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and
LINE 13: housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur
LINE 14: hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered
LINE 15: the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
LINE 16: Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of
LINE 17: rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.
LINE 18: "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this
LINE 19: nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
LINE 20: because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state
LINE 21: couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his
LINE 22: right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a
LINE 23: hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the
LINE 24: floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull
LINE 25: pain there that he had never felt before.
LINE 26: "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen!
LINE 27: Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more
LINE 28: effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's
LINE 29: the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad
LINE 30: and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that
LINE 31: you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can
LINE 32: all go to Hell!" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself
LINE 33: slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his
LINE 34: head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with
LINE 35: lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and
LINE 36: when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly
LINE 37: back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold
LINE 38: shudder.
LINE 39: He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time",
LINE 40: he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other
LINE 41: travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go
LINE 42: back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,
LINE 43: these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.
LINE 44: I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.
LINE 45: But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't
LINE 46: have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time
LINE 47: ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell
LINE 48: him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right
LINE 49: off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there
LINE 50: at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,
LINE 51: especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard
LINE 52: of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money
LINE 53: together to pay off my parents' debt to him—another five or six years I
LINE 54: suppose—that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big
LINE 55: change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at
LINE 56: five."
LINE 57: And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.
LINE 58: "God in Heaven!" he thought. It was half past six and the hands were
LINE 59: quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like
LINE 60: quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the
LINE 61: bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it
LINE 62: certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep
LINE 63: through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept
LINE 64: peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What
LINE 65: should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch
LINE 66: that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was
LINE 67: still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and
LINE 68: lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his
LINE 69: boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the
LINE 70: five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's
LINE 71: not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's
LINE 72: man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported
LINE 73: sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five
LINE 74: years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would
LINE 75: certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance
LINE 76: company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the
LINE 77: doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed
LINE 78: that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more,
LINE 79: would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,
LINE 80: apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel
LINE 81: completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.
LINE 82: He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to
LINE 83: get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a
LINE 84: cautious knock at the door near his head. "Gregor", somebody called—it
LINE 85: was his mother—"it's quarter to seven. Didn't you want to go
LINE 86: somewhere?" That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own
LINE 87: voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had
LINE 88: before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and
LINE 89: uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out
LINE 90: at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,
LINE 91: leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor
LINE 92: had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the
LINE 93: circumstances contented himself with saying: "Yes, mother, yes,
LINE 94: thank-you, I'm getting up now." The change in Gregor's voice probably
LINE 95: could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was
LINE 96: satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short
LINE 97: conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,
LINE 98: against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came
LINE 99: knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. "Gregor,
LINE 100: Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?" And after a short while he called
LINE 101: again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor! Gregor!" At the
LINE 102: other side door his sister came plaintively: "Gregor? Aren't you well?
LINE 103: Do you need anything?" Gregor answered to both sides: "I'm ready, now",
LINE 104: making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by
LINE 105: enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,
LINE 106: individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister
LINE 107: whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I beg of you." Gregor, however, had
LINE 108: no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for
LINE 109: his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors
LINE 110: at night even when he was at home.
LINE 111: The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being
LINE 112: disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only
LINE 113: then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he
LINE 114: would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in
LINE 115: bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps
LINE 116: caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure
LINE 117: imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve
LINE 118: themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change
LINE 119: in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,
LINE 120: which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.
LINE 121: It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow
LINE 122: himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became
LINE 123: difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He
LINE 124: would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead
LINE 125: of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in
LINE 126: different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If
LINE 127: he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would
LINE 128: stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with
LINE 129: that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about
LINE 130: painfully. "This is something that can't be done in bed", Gregor said
LINE 131: to himself, "so don't keep trying to do it".
LINE 132: The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out
LINE 133: of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not
LINE 134: imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it
LINE 135: went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly
LINE 136: shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose
LINE 137: the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned
LINE 138: from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might
LINE 139: well, at present, be the most sensitive.
LINE 140: So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,
LINE 141: carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,
LINE 142: and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually
LINE 143: followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last
LINE 144: got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him
LINE 145: that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not
LINE 146: injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the
LINE 147: same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better
LINE 148: to stay in bed than lose consciousness.
LINE 149: It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,
LINE 150: but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as
LINE 151: they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was
LINE 152: possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this
LINE 153: chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to
LINE 154: stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free
LINE 155: of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,
LINE 156: though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was
LINE 157: much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this
LINE 158: he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he
LINE 159: could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was
LINE 160: enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to
LINE 161: offer him. "Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when the clock
LINE 162: struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this." And
LINE 163: he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps
LINE 164: expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and
LINE 165: natural state.
LINE 166: But then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven I'll
LINE 167: definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody
LINE 168: will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me as well, as
LINE 169: they open up at work before seven o'clock." And so he set himself to
LINE 170: the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all
LINE 171: at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and
LINE 172: kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.
LINE 173: His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to
LINE 174: it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he
LINE 175: was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably
LINE 176: raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.
LINE 177: When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method
LINE 178: was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and
LINE 179: forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody
LINE 180: came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in
LINE 181: mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push
LINE 182: their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend
LINE 183: down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over
LINE 184: onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.
LINE 185: Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that
LINE 186: all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he
LINE 187: could not suppress a smile at this thought.
LINE 188: After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have
LINE 189: been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time
LINE 190: was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very
LINE 191: soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. "That'll be
LINE 192: someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very still, although
LINE 193: his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.
LINE 194: For a moment everything remained quiet. "They're not opening the door",
LINE 195: Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of
LINE 196: course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.
LINE 197: Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and he
LINE 198: knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the
LINE 199: only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became
LINE 200: highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,
LINE 201: every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful
LINE 202: and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he
LINE 203: couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of hours
LINE 204: in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one
LINE 205: of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even
LINE 206: necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have
LINE 207: to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that
LINE 208: only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate
LINE 209: it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any
LINE 210: proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.
LINE 211: There was a loud thump, but it wasn't really a loud noise. His fall was
LINE 212: softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor's back was also more
LINE 213: elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too
LINE 214: noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit
LINE 215: it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against
LINE 216: the carpet.
LINE 217: "Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the room on
LINE 218: the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that
LINE 219: had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you
LINE 220: had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this
LINE 221: question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his highly polished boots
LINE 222: could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,
LINE 223: Gregor's sister whispered to him to let him know: "Gregor, the chief
LINE 224: clerk is here." "Yes, I know", said Gregor to himself; but without
LINE 225: daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.
LINE 226: "Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chief
LINE 227: clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the
LINE 228: early train. We don't know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to
LINE 229: speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I'm sure he'll be
LINE 230: good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room." Then the chief
LINE 231: clerk called "Good morning, Mr. Samsa". "He isn't well", said his
LINE 232: mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through
LINE 233: the door. "He isn't well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have
LINE 234: missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly
LINE 235: makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he's been in
LINE 236: town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in
LINE 237: the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His
LINE 238: idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He's made a little
LINE 239: frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be
LINE 240: amazed how nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as
LINE 241: soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we
LINE 242: wouldn't have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;
LINE 243: he's so stubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that
LINE 244: he is, but he isn't." "I'll be there in a moment", said Gregor slowly
LINE 245: and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word
LINE 246: of the conversation. "Well I can't think of any other way of explaining
LINE 247: it, Mrs. Samsa", said the chief clerk, "I hope it's nothing serious.
LINE 248: But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever
LINE 249: become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,
LINE 250: we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations." "Can
LINE 251: the chief clerk come in to see you now then?", asked his father
LINE 252: impatiently, knocking at the door again. "No", said Gregor. In the room
LINE 253: on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left
LINE 254: his sister began to cry.
LINE 255: So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only
LINE 256: just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she
LINE 257: crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief
LINE 258: clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that
LINE 259: happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same
LINE 260: demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that
LINE 261: yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of
LINE 262: abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the
LINE 263: carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously
LINE 264: have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor
LINE 265: discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later
LINE 266: on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.
LINE 267: And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace
LINE 268: instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the
LINE 269: others didn't know what was happening, they were worried, that would
LINE 270: excuse their behaviour.
LINE 271: The chief clerk now raised his voice, "Mr. Samsa", he called to him,
LINE 272: "what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more
LINE 273: than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary
LINE 274: concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the
LINE 275: way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite
LINE 276: unheard of. I'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your
LINE 277: employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I
LINE 278: am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and
LINE 279: sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with
LINE 280: peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible
LINE 281: reason for your failure to appear, it's true—it had to do with the
LINE 282: money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him
LINE 283: my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now
LINE 284: that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish
LINE 285: whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all
LINE 286: that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in
LINE 287: private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good
LINE 288: reason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your
LINE 289: turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it's
LINE 290: not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;
LINE 291: but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.
LINE 292: Samsa, we cannot allow there to be."
LINE 293: "But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the
LINE 294: excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment. I'm slightly
LINE 295: unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get up. I'm
LINE 296: still in bed now. I'm quite fresh again now, though. I'm just getting
LINE 297: out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It's not quite as easy as I'd
LINE 298: thought. I'm quite alright now, though. It's shocking, what can
LINE 299: suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents
LINE 300: know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last
LINE 301: night already. They must have noticed it. I don't know why I didn't let
LINE 302: you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness
LINE 303: without staying at home. Please, don't make my parents suffer! There's
LINE 304: no basis for any of the accusations you're making; nobody's ever said a
LINE 305: word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven't read the latest
LINE 306: contracts I sent in. I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as
LINE 307: well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don't need to
LINE 308: wait, sir; I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good
LINE 309: as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"
LINE 310: And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was
LINE 311: saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily
LINE 312: done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where
LINE 313: he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the
LINE 314: door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief
LINE 315: clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn
LINE 316: what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked
LINE 317: then it would no longer be Gregor's responsibility and he could rest.
LINE 318: If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason
LINE 319: to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for
LINE 320: eight o'clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth
LINE 321: chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself
LINE 322: one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was
LINE 323: in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let
LINE 324: himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the
LINE 325: edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and
LINE 326: kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.
LINE 327: "Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked his
LINE 328: parents, "surely he's not trying to make fools of us". "Oh, God!"
LINE 329: called his mother, who was already in tears, "he could be seriously ill
LINE 330: and we're making him suffer. Grete! Grete!" she then cried. "Mother?"
LINE 331: his sister called from the other side. They communicated across
LINE 332: Gregor's room. "You'll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor
LINE 333: is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just
LINE 334: now?" "That was the voice of an animal", said the chief clerk, with a
LINE 335: calmness that was in contrast with his mother's screams. "Anna! Anna!"
LINE 336: his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping
LINE 337: his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!" And the two girls, their skirts
LINE 338: swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the
LINE 339: front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get
LINE 340: dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;
LINE 341: they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something
LINE 342: awful has happened.
LINE 343: Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn't
LINE 344: understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to
LINE 345: him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.
LINE 346: They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and
LINE 347: were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been
LINE 348: confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had
LINE 349: been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith
LINE 350: he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not
LINE 351: really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be
LINE 352: crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he
LINE 353: coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even
LINE 354: this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he
LINE 355: was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had
LINE 356: become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the
LINE 357: table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed
LINE 358: against the door and listening.
LINE 359: Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once
LINE 360: there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself
LINE 361: upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He
LINE 362: rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and
LINE 363: then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his
LINE 364: mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,
LINE 365: then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up
LINE 366: for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start
LINE 367: the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some
LINE 368: kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the
LINE 369: key and dripped onto the floor. "Listen", said the chief clerk in the
LINE 370: next room, "he's turning the key." Gregor was greatly encouraged by
LINE 371: this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his
LINE 372: mother too: "Well done, Gregor", they should have cried, "keep at it,
LINE 373: keep hold of the lock!" And with the idea that they were all excitedly
LINE 374: following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying
LINE 375: no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned
LINE 376: round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright
LINE 377: with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the
LINE 378: whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it
LINE 379: snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break his concentration,
LINE 380: and as he regained his breath he said to himself: "So, I didn't need
LINE 381: the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on the handle of the
LINE 382: door to open it completely.
LINE 383: Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open
LINE 384: before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one
LINE 385: of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not
LINE 386: want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still
LINE 387: occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to
LINE 388: anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud "Oh!",
LINE 389: which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was
LINE 390: the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and
LINE 391: slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.
LINE 392: Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief
LINE 393: clerk's being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,
LINE 394: took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into
LINE 395: her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head
LINE 396: disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and
LINE 397: clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.
LINE 398: Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with
LINE 399: his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.
LINE 400: So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the
LINE 401: other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half
LINE 402: of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant
LINE 403: over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had
LINE 404: become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the
LINE 405: other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite
LINE 406: clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its
LINE 407: façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual
LINE 408: droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from
LINE 409: breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for
LINE 410: Gregor's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and
LINE 411: he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of
LINE 412: different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph
LINE 413: of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand
LINE 414: and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his
LINE 415: uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the
LINE 416: front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and
LINE 417: the stairs where they began their way down below.
LINE 418: "Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have
LINE 419: kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and
LINE 420: set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see", he said to
LINE 421: the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and I like to do my job; being
LINE 422: a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn't
LINE 423: earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you
LINE 424: report everything accurately, then? It's quite possible for someone to
LINE 425: be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to
LINE 426: remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on,
LINE 427: once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all
LINE 428: the more diligence and concentration. You're well aware that I'm
LINE 429: seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my
LINE 430: parents and my sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation,
LINE 431: but I will work my way out of it again. Please don't make things any
LINE 432: harder for me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at
LINE 433: the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn
LINE 434: an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That's just
LINE 435: prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But
LINE 436: you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in
LINE 437: fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss
LINE 438: himself—it's very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes
LINE 439: about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And
LINE 440: you're also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year
LINE 441: away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip
LINE 442: and chance and groundless complaints, and it's almost impossible to
LINE 443: defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don't usually even hear
LINE 444: about them, or if at all it's when we arrive back home exhausted from a
LINE 445: trip, and that's when we feel the harmful effects of what's been going
LINE 446: on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don't go away, at
LINE 447: least first say something to show that you grant that I'm at least
LINE 448: partly right!"
LINE 449: But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to
LINE 450: speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his
LINE 451: trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment
LINE 452: while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without
LINE 453: taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been
LINE 454: some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had
LINE 455: reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot
LINE 456: from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he
LINE 457: stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,
LINE 458: there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.
LINE 459: Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk
LINE 460: go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into
LINE 461: extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very
LINE 462: well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would
LINE 463: provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much
LINE 464: to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for
LINE 465: the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk
LINE 466: had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the
LINE 467: future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were
LINE 468: here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still
LINE 469: lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,
LINE 470: surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the
LINE 471: entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was
LINE 472: not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without
LINE 473: considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move
LINE 474: about in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or
LINE 475: probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself
LINE 476: through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,
LINE 477: ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but
LINE 478: Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought
LINE 479: something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had
LINE 480: that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel
LINE 481: alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;
LINE 482: to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even
LINE 483: making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon
LINE 484: believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held
LINE 485: back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there
LINE 486: on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,
LINE 487: at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up
LINE 488: with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: "Help, for
LINE 489: pity's sake, Help!" The way she held her head suggested she wanted to
LINE 490: see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards
LINE 491: showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind
LINE 492: her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she
LINE 493: sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even
LINE 494: seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush
LINE 495: of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.
LINE 496: "Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had
LINE 497: completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help
LINE 498: himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of
LINE 499: coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and
LINE 500: into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,
LINE 501: had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already
LINE 502: reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for
LINE 503: the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of
LINE 504: reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt
LINE 505: down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all
LINE 506: around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,
LINE 507: unfortunately, to put Gregor's father into a panic as well. Until then
LINE 508: he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running
LINE 509: after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he
LINE 510: ran after him, Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his
LINE 511: right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with
LINE 512: his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with
LINE 513: his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping
LINE 514: his foot at him as he went. Gregor's appeals to his father were of no
LINE 515: help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly
LINE 516: turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.
LINE 517: Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had pulled
LINE 518: open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A
LINE 519: strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the
LINE 520: curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of
LINE 521: them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor's father as
LINE 522: he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor
LINE 523: had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go
LINE 524: very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would
LINE 525: have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he
LINE 526: took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there
LINE 527: was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in
LINE 528: his father's hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that
LINE 529: he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable
LINE 530: of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as
LINE 531: possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn
LINE 532: himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to
LINE 533: see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now
LINE 534: and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a
LINE 535: distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that
LINE 536: unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had
LINE 537: nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made
LINE 538: a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He
LINE 539: was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but
LINE 540: then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get
LINE 541: through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it
LINE 542: obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double
LINE 543: doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was
LINE 544: merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room
LINE 545: as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time
LINE 546: to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.
LINE 547: What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards
LINE 548: all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to
LINE 549: Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not
LINE 550: a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway
LINE 551: without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted
LINE 552: itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the
LINE 553: white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,
LINE 554: soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by
LINE 555: himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while
LINE 556: those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then
LINE 557: his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from
LINE 558: where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into
LINE 559: his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all
LINE 560: was quiet.
