LINE 1: It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain
LINE 2: among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;
LINE 3: but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad
LINE 4: to find himself still alive.
LINE 5: "I ran as fast as I could," he said, sitting down and yawning, "but the
LINE 6: flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?"
LINE 7: Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved
LINE 8: him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:
LINE 9: "I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little
LINE 10: things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as
LINE 11: mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what
LINE 12: shall we do now?"
LINE 13: "We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again," said
LINE 14: Dorothy, "and then we can keep on to the Emerald City."
LINE 15: So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,
LINE 16: they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through
LINE 17: the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road
LINE 18: of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the
LINE 19: Great Oz dwelt.
LINE 20: The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was
LINE 21: beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far
LINE 22: behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.
LINE 23: Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were
LINE 24: painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer
LINE 25: evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of
LINE 26: these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the
LINE 27: doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no
LINE 28: one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of
LINE 29: which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in
LINE 30: clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like
LINE 31: those of the Munchkins.
LINE 32: "This must be the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, "and we are surely getting
LINE 33: near the Emerald City."
LINE 34: "Yes," answered the Scarecrow. "Everything is green here, while in the
LINE 35: country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do
LINE 36: not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be
LINE 37: unable to find a place to pass the night."
LINE 38: "I should like something to eat besides fruit," said the girl, "and I'm
LINE 39: sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to
LINE 40: the people."
LINE 41: So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up
LINE 42: to the door and knocked.
LINE 43: A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, "What do you
LINE 44: want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?"
LINE 45: "We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us," answered
LINE 46: Dorothy; "and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you
LINE 47: for the world."
LINE 48: "Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.
LINE 49: "Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too. He will be
LINE 50: more afraid of you than you are of him."
LINE 51: "Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep
LINE 52: at the Lion, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you
LINE 53: some supper and a place to sleep."
LINE 54: So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two
LINE 55: children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the
LINE 56: couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a
LINE 57: company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:
LINE 58: "Where are you all going?"
LINE 59: "To the Emerald City," said Dorothy, "to see the Great Oz."
LINE 60: "Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the man. "Are you sure that Oz will see you?"
LINE 61: "Why not?" she replied.
LINE 62: "Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I
LINE 63: have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and
LINE 64: wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,
LINE 65: nor do I know of any living person who has seen him."
LINE 66: "Does he never go out?" asked the Scarecrow.
LINE 67: "Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,
LINE 68: and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face."
LINE 69: "What is he like?" asked the girl.
LINE 70: "That is hard to tell," said the man thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is a
LINE 71: Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he
LINE 72: looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say
LINE 73: he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a
LINE 74: brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,
LINE 75: when he is in his own form, no living person can tell."
LINE 76: "That is very strange," said Dorothy, "but we must try, in some way, to
LINE 77: see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing."
LINE 78: "Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?" asked the man.
LINE 79: "I want him to give me some brains," said the Scarecrow eagerly.
LINE 80: "Oh, Oz could do that easily enough," declared the man. "He has more
LINE 81: brains than he needs."
LINE 82: "And I want him to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
LINE 83: "That will not trouble him," continued the man, "for Oz has a large
LINE 84: collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes."
LINE 85: "And I want him to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion.
LINE 86: "Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room," said the man,
LINE 87: "which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running
LINE 88: over. He will be glad to give you some."
LINE 89: "And I want him to send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
LINE 90: "Where is Kansas?" asked the man, with surprise.
LINE 91: "I don't know," replied Dorothy sorrowfully, "but it is my home, and
LINE 92: I'm sure it's somewhere."
LINE 93: "Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find
LINE 94: Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a
LINE 95: hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he
LINE 96: usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?" he continued, speaking
LINE 97: to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not
LINE 98: speak.
LINE 99: The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered
LINE 100: around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of
LINE 101: scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.
LINE 102: The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it
LINE 103: was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The
LINE 104: Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of
LINE 105: everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.
LINE 106: The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside
LINE 107: her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be
LINE 108: disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and
LINE 109: kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.
LINE 110: The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,
LINE 111: and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.
LINE 112: "That must be the Emerald City," said Dorothy.
LINE 113: As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it
LINE 114: seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it
LINE 115: was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the
LINE 116: City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.
LINE 117: In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big
LINE 118: gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even
LINE 119: the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.
LINE 120: There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and
LINE 121: heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly
LINE 122: open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched
LINE 123: room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.
LINE 124: Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He
LINE 125: was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin
LINE 126: was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.
LINE 127: When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, "What do you wish
LINE 128: in the Emerald City?"
LINE 129: "We came here to see the Great Oz," said Dorothy.
LINE 130: The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it
LINE 131: over.
LINE 132: "It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz," he said,
LINE 133: shaking his head in perplexity. "He is powerful and terrible, and if
LINE 134: you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of
LINE 135: the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant."
LINE 136: "But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the
LINE 137: Scarecrow; "it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good
LINE 138: Wizard."
LINE 139: "So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely
LINE 140: and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from
LINE 141: curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his
LINE 142: face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the
LINE 143: Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the
LINE 144: spectacles."
LINE 145: "Why?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 146: "Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the
LINE 147: Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear
LINE 148: spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it
LINE 149: when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock
LINE 150: them."
LINE 151: He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with
LINE 152: spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in
LINE 153: them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit
LINE 154: Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands
LINE 155: fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they
LINE 156: were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the
LINE 157: Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy
LINE 158: could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish
LINE 159: to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.
LINE 160: Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin
LINE 161: Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast
LINE 162: with the key.
LINE 163: Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he
LINE 164: was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a
LINE 165: peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him
LINE 166: through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.
