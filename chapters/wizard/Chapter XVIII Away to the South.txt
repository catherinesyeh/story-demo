LINE 1: Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas
LINE 2: again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone
LINE 3: up in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her
LINE 4: companions.
LINE 5: The Tin Woodman came to her and said:
LINE 6: "Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave
LINE 7: me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,
LINE 8: if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust."
LINE 9: "With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the
LINE 10: Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears
LINE 11: carefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he
LINE 12: thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled
LINE 13: oil-can, to guard against mishap.
LINE 14: The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he
LINE 15: was not a Wizard the people were proud of him. "For," they said, "there
LINE 16: is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man."
LINE 17: And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.
LINE 18: The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers
LINE 19: met in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in
LINE 20: the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.
LINE 21: "We are not so unlucky," said the new ruler, "for this Palace and the
LINE 22: Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I
LINE 23: remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's
LINE 24: cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am
LINE 25: quite satisfied with my lot."
LINE 26: "I also," said the Tin Woodman, "am well-pleased with my new heart;
LINE 27: and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world."
LINE 28: "For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that
LINE 29: ever lived, if not braver," said the Lion modestly.
LINE 30: "If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,"
LINE 31: continued the Scarecrow, "we might all be happy together."
LINE 32: "But I don't want to live here," cried Dorothy. "I want to go to
LINE 33: Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry."
LINE 34: "Well, then, what can be done?" inquired the Woodman.
LINE 35: The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins
LINE 36: and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:
LINE 37: "Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the
LINE 38: desert?"
LINE 39: "I never thought of that!" said Dorothy joyfully. "It's just the thing.
LINE 40: I'll go at once for the Golden Cap."
LINE 41: When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and
LINE 42: soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and
LINE 43: stood beside her.
LINE 44: "This is the second time you have called us," said the Monkey King,
LINE 45: bowing before the little girl. "What do you wish?"
LINE 46: "I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.
LINE 47: But the Monkey King shook his head.
LINE 48: "That cannot be done," he said. "We belong to this country alone, and
LINE 49: cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,
LINE 50: and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We
LINE 51: shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross
LINE 52: the desert. Good-bye."
LINE 53: And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away
LINE 54: through the window, followed by all his band.
LINE 55: Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. "I have wasted the charm
LINE 56: of the Golden Cap to no purpose," she said, "for the Winged Monkeys
LINE 57: cannot help me."
LINE 58: "It is certainly too bad!" said the tender-hearted Woodman.
LINE 59: The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly
LINE 60: that Dorothy feared it would burst.
LINE 61: "Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers," he said, "and ask
LINE 62: his advice."
LINE 63: So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for
LINE 64: while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.
LINE 65: "This little girl," said the Scarecrow to the soldier, "wishes to cross
LINE 66: the desert. How can she do so?"
LINE 67: "I cannot tell," answered the soldier, "for nobody has ever crossed the
LINE 68: desert, unless it is Oz himself."
LINE 69: "Is there no one who can help me?" asked Dorothy earnestly.
LINE 70: "Glinda might," he suggested.
LINE 71: "Who is Glinda?" inquired the Scarecrow.
LINE 72: "The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,
LINE 73: and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of
LINE 74: the desert, so she may know a way to cross it."
LINE 75: "Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?" asked the child.
LINE 76: "The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind
LINE 77: to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows
LINE 78: how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."
LINE 79: "How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 80: "The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be
LINE 81: full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a
LINE 82: race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For
LINE 83: this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City."
LINE 84: The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:
LINE 85: "It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is
LINE 86: to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of
LINE 87: course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas."
LINE 88: "You must have been thinking again," remarked the Tin Woodman.
LINE 89: "I have," said the Scarecrow.
LINE 90: "I shall go with Dorothy," declared the Lion, "for I am tired of your
LINE 91: city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild
LINE 92: beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her."
LINE 93: "That is true," agreed the Woodman. "My axe may be of service to her;
LINE 94: so I also will go with her to the Land of the South."
LINE 95: "When shall we start?" asked the Scarecrow.
LINE 96: "Are you going?" they asked, in surprise.
LINE 97: "Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.
LINE 98: She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the
LINE 99: Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never
LINE 100: leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all."
LINE 101: "Thank you," said Dorothy gratefully. "You are all very kind to me. But
LINE 102: I should like to start as soon as possible."
LINE 103: "We shall go tomorrow morning," returned the Scarecrow. "So now let us
LINE 104: all get ready, for it will be a long journey."
LINE 105: Chapter XIX
LINE 106: Attacked by the Fighting Trees
LINE 107: The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and
LINE 108: they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had
LINE 109: walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw
LINE 110: them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City
LINE 111: to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,
LINE 112: which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to
LINE 113: carry with them.
LINE 114: "You are now our ruler," he said to the Scarecrow; "so you must come
LINE 115: back to us as soon as possible."
LINE 116: "I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied; "but I must
LINE 117: help Dorothy to get home, first."
LINE 118: As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:
LINE 119: "I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has
LINE 120: been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am."
LINE 121: "Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like to keep you with us,
LINE 122: but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a
LINE 123: way." He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth
LINE 124: and started upon their journey.
LINE 125: The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the
LINE 126: Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed
LINE 127: and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of
LINE 128: getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of
LINE 129: use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and
LINE 130: whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country
LINE 131: again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,
LINE 132: barking merrily all the time.
LINE 133: "City life does not agree with me at all," remarked the Lion, as they
LINE 134: walked along at a brisk pace. "I have lost much flesh since I lived
LINE 135: there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how
LINE 136: courageous I have grown."
LINE 137: They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they
LINE 138: could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and
LINE 139: high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.
LINE 140: "Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the Tin Woodman, as he
LINE 141: felt his heart rattling around in his breast.
LINE 142: "He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too," said the
LINE 143: Scarecrow.
LINE 144: "If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me," added the
LINE 145: Lion, "he would have been a brave man."
LINE 146: Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he
LINE 147: had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,
LINE 148: even if he was a bad Wizard.
LINE 149: The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers
LINE 150: that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that
LINE 151: night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they
LINE 152: rested very well indeed.
LINE 153: In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There
LINE 154: was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and
LINE 155: left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change
LINE 156: the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked
LINE 157: for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.
LINE 158: The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with
LINE 159: such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass
LINE 160: underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under
LINE 161: the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next
LINE 162: minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his
LINE 163: fellow travelers.
LINE 164: This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked
LINE 165: rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.
LINE 166: "Here is another space between the trees," called the Lion.
LINE 167: "Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt me to
LINE 168: get thrown about." He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its
LINE 169: branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.
LINE 170: "This is strange," exclaimed Dorothy. "What shall we do?"
LINE 171: "The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our
LINE 172: journey," remarked the Lion.
LINE 173: "I believe I will try it myself," said the Woodman, and shouldering his
LINE 174: axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so
LINE 175: roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped
LINE 176: at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking
LINE 177: all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under
LINE 178: it.
LINE 179: "Come on!" he shouted to the others. "Be quick!" They all ran forward
LINE 180: and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught
LINE 181: by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly
LINE 182: chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.
LINE 183: The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they
LINE 184: made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down
LINE 185: their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the
LINE 186: forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out
LINE 187: of it.
LINE 188: The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came
LINE 189: to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found
LINE 190: before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was
LINE 191: smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.
LINE 192: "What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 193: "I will make a ladder," said the Tin Woodman, "for we certainly must
LINE 194: climb over the wall."
