LINE 48: Introduction
LINE 49: Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood
LINE 50: through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and
LINE 51: instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly
LINE 52: unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more
LINE 53: happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.
LINE 54: Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be
LINE 55: classed as "historical" in the children's library; for the time has
LINE 56: come for a series of newer "wonder tales" in which the stereotyped
LINE 57: genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible
LINE 58: and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a
LINE 59: fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality;
LINE 60: therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales
LINE 61: and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.
LINE 62: Having this thought in mind, the story of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
LINE 63: was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a
LINE 64: modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and
LINE 65: the heartaches and nightmares are left out.
