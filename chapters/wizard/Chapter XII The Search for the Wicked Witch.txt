LINE 1: The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the
LINE 2: Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the
LINE 3: Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in
LINE 4: his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.
LINE 5: "Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 6: "There is no road," answered the Guardian of the Gates. "No one ever
LINE 7: wishes to go that way."
LINE 8: "How, then, are we to find her?" inquired the girl.
LINE 9: "That will be easy," replied the man, "for when she knows you are in
LINE 10: the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her
LINE 11: slaves."
LINE 12: "Perhaps not," said the Scarecrow, "for we mean to destroy her."
LINE 13: "Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates. "No one has
LINE 14: ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves
LINE 15: of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and
LINE 16: fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where
LINE 17: the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her."
LINE 18: They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,
LINE 19: walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies
LINE 20: and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on
LINE 21: in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer
LINE 22: green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its
LINE 23: green color and was as white as Dorothy's dress.
LINE 24: The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground
LINE 25: became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this
LINE 26: country of the West, and the ground was untilled.
LINE 27: In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no
LINE 28: trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and
LINE 29: the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with
LINE 30: the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.
LINE 31: Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as
LINE 32: powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in
LINE 33: the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy
LINE 34: lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance
LINE 35: off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she
LINE 36: blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.
LINE 37: At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great
LINE 38: wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.
LINE 39: "Go to those people," said the Witch, "and tear them to pieces."
LINE 40: "Are you not going to make them your slaves?" asked the leader of the
LINE 41: wolves.
LINE 42: "No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and
LINE 43: another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into
LINE 44: small pieces."
LINE 45: "Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed
LINE 46: by the others.
LINE 47: It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard
LINE 48: the wolves coming.
LINE 49: "This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet
LINE 50: them as they come."
LINE 51: He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of
LINE 52: the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's
LINE 53: head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could
LINE 54: raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp
LINE 55: edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty
LINE 56: times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap
LINE 57: before the Woodman.
LINE 58: Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, "It
LINE 59: was a good fight, friend."
LINE 60: They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was
LINE 61: quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the
LINE 62: Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down
LINE 63: to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.
LINE 64: Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle
LINE 65: and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her
LINE 66: wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her
LINE 67: country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver
LINE 68: whistle twice.
LINE 69: Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough
LINE 70: to darken the sky.
LINE 71: And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, "Fly at once to the
LINE 72: strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces."
LINE 73: The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her
LINE 74: companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.
LINE 75: But the Scarecrow said, "This is my battle, so lie down beside me and
LINE 76: you will not be harmed."
LINE 77: So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up
LINE 78: and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were
LINE 79: frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare
LINE 80: to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:
LINE 81: "It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out."
LINE 82: The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and
LINE 83: twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and
LINE 84: the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty
LINE 85: times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead
LINE 86: beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they
LINE 87: went upon their journey.
LINE 88: When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a
LINE 89: heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her
LINE 90: silver whistle.
LINE 91: Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of
LINE 92: black bees came flying toward her.
LINE 93: "Go to the strangers and sting them to death!" commanded the Witch, and
LINE 94: the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and
LINE 95: her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the
LINE 96: Scarecrow had decided what to do.
LINE 97: "Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and
LINE 98: the Lion," he said to the Woodman, "and the bees cannot sting them."
LINE 99: This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held
LINE 100: Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.
LINE 101: The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew
LINE 102: at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting
LINE 103: the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are
LINE 104: broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick
LINE 105: about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.
LINE 106: Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman
LINE 107: put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as
LINE 108: ever. So they started upon their journey once more.
LINE 109: The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little
LINE 110: heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and
LINE 111: gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were
LINE 112: the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the
LINE 113: strangers and destroy them.
LINE 114: The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were
LINE 115: told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the
LINE 116: Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies
LINE 117: were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.
LINE 118: When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a
LINE 119: strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to
LINE 120: think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her
LINE 121: plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful
LINE 122: Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to
LINE 123: act.
LINE 124: There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and
LINE 125: rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it
LINE 126: could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any
LINE 127: order they were given. But no person could command these strange
LINE 128: creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had
LINE 129: used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her
LINE 130: slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys
LINE 131: had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against
LINE 132: the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The
LINE 133: Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could
LINE 134: she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so
LINE 135: until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce
LINE 136: wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her
LINE 137: slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was
LINE 138: only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.
LINE 139: So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it
LINE 140: upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:
LINE 141: "Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!"
LINE 142: Next she stood upon her right foot and said:
LINE 143: "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!"
LINE 144: After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:
LINE 145: "Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!"
LINE 146: Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling
LINE 147: sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great
LINE 148: chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show
LINE 149: the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of
LINE 150: immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.
LINE 151: One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew
LINE 152: close to the Witch and said, "You have called us for the third and last
LINE 153: time. What do you command?"
LINE 154: "Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except
LINE 155: the Lion," said the Wicked Witch. "Bring that beast to me, for I have a
LINE 156: mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work."
LINE 157: "Your commands shall be obeyed," said the leader. Then, with a great
LINE 158: deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place
LINE 159: where Dorothy and her friends were walking.
LINE 160: Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the
LINE 161: air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.
LINE 162: Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the
LINE 163: rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move
LINE 164: nor groan.
LINE 165: Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers
LINE 166: pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat
LINE 167: and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top
LINE 168: branches of a tall tree.
LINE 169: The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and
LINE 170: wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable
LINE 171: to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and
LINE 172: flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a
LINE 173: small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not
LINE 174: escape.
LINE 175: But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,
LINE 176: watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her
LINE 177: turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy
LINE 178: arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the
LINE 179: mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,
LINE 180: motioning the others not to touch her.
LINE 181: "We dare not harm this little girl," he said to them, "for she is
LINE 182: protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of
LINE 183: Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch
LINE 184: and leave her there."
LINE 185: So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried
LINE 186: her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they
LINE 187: set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the
LINE 188: Witch:
LINE 189: "We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the
LINE 190: Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The
LINE 191: little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your
LINE 192: power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again."
LINE 193: Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and
LINE 194: noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.
LINE 195: The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark
LINE 196: on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged
LINE 197: Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked
LINE 198: down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble
LINE 199: with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At
LINE 200: first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened
LINE 201: to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them
LINE 202: was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the
LINE 203: Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and
LINE 204: thought, "I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to
LINE 205: use her power." Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:
LINE 206: "Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you
LINE 207: do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the
LINE 208: Scarecrow."
LINE 209: Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle
LINE 210: until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots
LINE 211: and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
LINE 212: Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as
LINE 213: she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill
LINE 214: her.
LINE 215: With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the
LINE 216: courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse
LINE 217: her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to
LINE 218: go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and
LINE 219: bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and
LINE 220: shut the gate again.
LINE 221: "If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through
LINE 222: the bars of the gate, "I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat
LINE 223: until you do as I wish."
LINE 224: So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day
LINE 225: she came to the gate at noon and asked, "Are you ready to be harnessed
LINE 226: like a horse?"
LINE 227: And the Lion would answer, "No. If you come in this yard, I will bite
LINE 228: you."
LINE 229: The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that
LINE 230: every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from
LINE 231: the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,
LINE 232: and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy
LINE 233: mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to
LINE 234: escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was
LINE 235: constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the
LINE 236: Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.
LINE 237: The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch
LINE 238: threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in
LINE 239: her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of
LINE 240: the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full
LINE 241: of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with
LINE 242: her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in
LINE 243: return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so
LINE 244: wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.
LINE 245: Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would
LINE 246: be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes
LINE 247: she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and
LINE 248: looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for
LINE 249: his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas
LINE 250: or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the
LINE 251: little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.
LINE 252: Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver
LINE 253: Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves
LINE 254: were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of
LINE 255: the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,
LINE 256: they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.
LINE 257: She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,
LINE 258: thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty
LINE 259: shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took
LINE 260: her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in
LINE 261: Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was
LINE 262: greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy
LINE 263: was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let
LINE 264: water touch her in any way.
LINE 265: But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a
LINE 266: trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in
LINE 267: the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the
LINE 268: iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the
LINE 269: floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at
LINE 270: full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver
LINE 271: Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched
LINE 272: it away and put it on her own skinny foot.
LINE 273: The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for
LINE 274: as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their
LINE 275: charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how
LINE 276: to do so.
LINE 277: The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew
LINE 278: angry, and said to the Witch, "Give me back my shoe!"
LINE 279: "I will not," retorted the Witch, "for it is now my shoe, and not
LINE 280: yours."
LINE 281: "You are a wicked creature!" cried Dorothy. "You have no right to take
LINE 282: my shoe from me."
LINE 283: "I shall keep it, just the same," said the Witch, laughing at her, "and
LINE 284: someday I shall get the other one from you, too."
LINE 285: This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water
LINE 286: that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to
LINE 287: foot.
LINE 288: Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as
LINE 289: Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall
LINE 290: away.
LINE 291: "See what you have done!" she screamed. "In a minute I shall melt
LINE 292: away."
LINE 293: "I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see
LINE 294: the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.
LINE 295: "Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the Witch, in a
LINE 296: wailing, despairing voice.
LINE 297: "Of course not," answered Dorothy. "How should I?"
LINE 298: "Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the
LINE 299: castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a
LINE 300: little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked
LINE 301: deeds. Look out—here I go!"
LINE 302: With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass
LINE 303: and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing
LINE 304: that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket
LINE 305: of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the
LINE 306: door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of
LINE 307: the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her
LINE 308: foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to
LINE 309: the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had
LINE 310: come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange
LINE 311: land.
