LINE 1: Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and
LINE 2: full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and
LINE 3: plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest
LINE 4: they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many
LINE 5: discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that
LINE 6: seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.
LINE 7: To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.
LINE 8: But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few
LINE 9: more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready
LINE 10: to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in
LINE 11: her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,
LINE 12: for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood
LINE 13: upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands
LINE 14: to push the raft through the water.
LINE 15: They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of
LINE 16: the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and
LINE 17: farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep
LINE 18: that the long poles would not touch the bottom.
LINE 19: "This is bad," said the Tin Woodman, "for if we cannot get to the land
LINE 20: we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,
LINE 21: and she will enchant us and make us her slaves."
LINE 22: "And then I should get no brains," said the Scarecrow.
LINE 23: "And I should get no courage," said the Cowardly Lion.
LINE 24: "And I should get no heart," said the Tin Woodman.
LINE 25: "And I should never get back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
LINE 26: "We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can," the Scarecrow
LINE 27: continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in
LINE 28: the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out
LINE 29: again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was
LINE 30: left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.
LINE 31: "Good-bye!" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave
LINE 32: him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered
LINE 33: that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.
LINE 34: Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.
LINE 35: "I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy," he thought. "Then,
LINE 36: I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare
LINE 37: the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow
LINE 38: stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never
LINE 39: have any brains, after all!"
LINE 40: Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far
LINE 41: behind. Then the Lion said:
LINE 42: "Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and
LINE 43: pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my
LINE 44: tail."
LINE 45: So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of
LINE 46: his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the
LINE 47: shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they
LINE 48: were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's
LINE 49: long pole and helped push the raft to the land.
LINE 50: They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped
LINE 51: off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had
LINE 52: carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the
LINE 53: Emerald City.
LINE 54: "What shall we do now?" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on
LINE 55: the grass to let the sun dry him.
LINE 56: "We must get back to the road, in some way," said Dorothy.
LINE 57: "The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the
LINE 58: road again," remarked the Lion.
LINE 59: So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they
LINE 60: started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had
LINE 61: carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit
LINE 62: trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for
LINE 63: the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.
LINE 64: They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to
LINE 65: pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:
LINE 66: "Look!"
LINE 67: Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon
LINE 68: his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.
LINE 69: "What can we do to save him?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 70: The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.
LINE 71: So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow
LINE 72: until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the
LINE 73: water's edge.
LINE 74: "Who are you and where are you going?" asked the Stork.
LINE 75: "I am Dorothy," answered the girl, "and these are my friends, the Tin
LINE 76: Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City."
LINE 77: "This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and
LINE 78: looked sharply at the queer party.
LINE 79: "I know it," returned Dorothy, "but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are
LINE 80: wondering how we shall get him again."
LINE 81: "Where is he?" asked the Stork.
LINE 82: "Over there in the river," answered the little girl.
LINE 83: "If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you," remarked the
LINE 84: Stork.
LINE 85: "He isn't heavy a bit," said Dorothy eagerly, "for he is stuffed with
LINE 86: straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever
LINE 87: and ever so much."
LINE 88: "Well, I'll try," said the Stork, "but if I find he is too heavy to
LINE 89: carry I shall have to drop him in the river again."
LINE 90: So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to
LINE 91: where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her
LINE 92: great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into
LINE 93: the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin
LINE 94: Woodman and Toto were sitting.
LINE 95: When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so
LINE 96: happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they
LINE 97: walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt so gay.
LINE 98: "I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever," he said,
LINE 99: "but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find
LINE 100: the Stork again and do her some kindness in return."
LINE 101: "That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.
LINE 102: "I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my
LINE 103: babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald
LINE 104: City and that Oz will help you."
LINE 105: "Thank you," replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air
LINE 106: and was soon out of sight.
LINE 107: They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored
LINE 108: birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that
LINE 109: the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and
LINE 110: blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,
LINE 111: which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.
LINE 112: "Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy
LINE 113: scent of the bright flowers.
LINE 114: "I suppose so," answered the Scarecrow. "When I have brains, I shall
LINE 115: probably like them better."
LINE 116: "If I only had a heart, I should love them," added the Tin Woodman.
LINE 117: "I always did like flowers," said the Lion. "They seem so helpless and
LINE 118: frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these."
LINE 119: They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer
LINE 120: and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the
LINE 121: midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when
LINE 122: there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that
LINE 123: anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried
LINE 124: away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But
LINE 125: Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red
LINE 126: flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy
LINE 127: and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.
LINE 128: But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.
LINE 129: "We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,"
LINE 130: he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until
LINE 131: Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and
LINE 132: she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.
LINE 133: "What shall we do?" asked the Tin Woodman.
LINE 134: "If we leave her here she will die," said the Lion. "The smell of the
LINE 135: flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and
LINE 136: the dog is asleep already."
LINE 137: It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the
LINE 138: Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not
LINE 139: troubled by the scent of the flowers.
LINE 140: "Run fast," said the Scarecrow to the Lion, "and get out of this deadly
LINE 141: flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,
LINE 142: but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried."
LINE 143: So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.
LINE 144: In a moment he was out of sight.
LINE 145: "Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her," said the Scarecrow.
LINE 146: So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they
LINE 147: made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms
LINE 148: and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.
LINE 149: On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly
LINE 150: flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of
LINE 151: the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast
LINE 152: asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge
LINE 153: beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance
LINE 154: from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in
LINE 155: beautiful green fields before them.
LINE 156: "We can do nothing for him," said the Tin Woodman, sadly; "for he is
LINE 157: much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and
LINE 158: perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last."
LINE 159: "I'm sorry," said the Scarecrow. "The Lion was a very good comrade for
LINE 160: one so cowardly. But let us go on."
LINE 161: They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far
LINE 162: enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the
LINE 163: poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass
LINE 164: and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.
