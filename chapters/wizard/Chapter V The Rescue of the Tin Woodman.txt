LINE 1: When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had
LINE 2: long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and
LINE 3: looked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in
LINE 4: his corner, waiting for her.
LINE 5: "We must go and search for water," she said to him.
LINE 6: "Why do you want water?" he asked.
LINE 7: "To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the
LINE 8: dry bread will not stick in my throat."
LINE 9: "It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the Scarecrow
LINE 10: thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have
LINE 11: brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly."
LINE 12: They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a
LINE 13: little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate
LINE 14: her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and
LINE 15: the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for
LINE 16: there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.
LINE 17: When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of
LINE 18: yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.
LINE 19: "What was that?" she asked timidly.
LINE 20: "I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we can go and see."
LINE 21: Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to
LINE 22: come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few
LINE 23: steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine
LINE 24: that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped
LINE 25: short, with a little cry of surprise.
LINE 26: One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing
LINE 27: beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely
LINE 28: of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he
LINE 29: stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.
LINE 30: Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while
LINE 31: Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his
LINE 32: teeth.
LINE 33: "Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 34: "Yes," answered the tin man, "I did. I've been groaning for more than a
LINE 35: year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."
LINE 36: "What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the
LINE 37: sad voice in which the man spoke.
LINE 38: "Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered. "They are rusted so
LINE 39: badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon
LINE 40: be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."
LINE 41: Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then
LINE 42: she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"
LINE 43: "Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as
LINE 44: it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and
LINE 45: moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the
LINE 46: man could turn it himself.
LINE 47: "Now oil the joints in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled them and
LINE 48: the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust
LINE 49: and as good as new.
LINE 50: The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which
LINE 51: he leaned against the tree.
LINE 52: "This is a great comfort," he said. "I have been holding that axe in
LINE 53: the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at
LINE 54: last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right
LINE 55: once more."
LINE 56: So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked
LINE 57: them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite
LINE 58: creature, and very grateful.
LINE 59: "I might have stood there always if you had not come along," he said;
LINE 60: "so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?"
LINE 61: "We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz," she
LINE 62: answered, "and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night."
LINE 63: "Why do you wish to see Oz?" he asked.
LINE 64: "I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to
LINE 65: put a few brains into his head," she replied.
LINE 66: The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:
LINE 67: "Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?"
LINE 68: "Why, I guess so," Dorothy answered. "It would be as easy as to give
LINE 69: the Scarecrow brains."
LINE 70: "True," the Tin Woodman returned. "So, if you will allow me to join
LINE 71: your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me."
LINE 72: "Come along," said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she
LINE 73: would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his
LINE 74: axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road
LINE 75: that was paved with yellow brick.
LINE 76: The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.
LINE 77: "For," he said, "if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I
LINE 78: would need the oil-can badly."
LINE 79: It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for
LINE 80: soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place
LINE 81: where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the
LINE 82: travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe
LINE 83: and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire
LINE 84: party.
LINE 85: Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not
LINE 86: notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the
LINE 87: side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up
LINE 88: again.
LINE 89: "Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the Tin Woodman.
LINE 90: "I don't know enough," replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. "My head is
LINE 91: stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask
LINE 92: him for some brains."
LINE 93: "Oh, I see," said the Tin Woodman. "But, after all, brains are not the
LINE 94: best things in the world."
LINE 95: "Have you any?" inquired the Scarecrow.
LINE 96: "No, my head is quite empty," answered the Woodman. "But once I had
LINE 97: brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much
LINE 98: rather have a heart."
LINE 99: "And why is that?" asked the Scarecrow.
LINE 100: "I will tell you my story, and then you will know."
LINE 101: So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told
LINE 102: the following story:
LINE 103: "I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest
LINE 104: and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a
LINE 105: woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as
LINE 106: long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone
LINE 107: I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.
LINE 108: "There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon
LINE 109: grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry
LINE 110: me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for
LINE 111: her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old
LINE 112: woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she
LINE 113: wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the
LINE 114: housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and
LINE 115: promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.
LINE 116: Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping
LINE 117: away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my
LINE 118: wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my
LINE 119: left leg.
LINE 120: "This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man
LINE 121: could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and
LINE 122: had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I
LINE 123: was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for
LINE 124: she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin
LINE 125: girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right
LINE 126: leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of
LINE 127: tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;
LINE 128: but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked
LINE 129: Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I
LINE 130: thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come
LINE 131: along, and he made me a new head out of tin.
LINE 132: "I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than
LINE 133: ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a
LINE 134: new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my
LINE 135: axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into
LINE 136: two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body
LINE 137: of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of
LINE 138: joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had
LINE 139: now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did
LINE 140: not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living
LINE 141: with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.
LINE 142: "My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and
LINE 143: it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There
LINE 144: was only one dangerâ€”that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in
LINE 145: my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,
LINE 146: there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a
LINE 147: rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I
LINE 148: was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a
LINE 149: terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time
LINE 150: to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.
LINE 151: While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can
LINE 152: love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me
LINE 153: one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."
LINE 154: Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story
LINE 155: of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a
LINE 156: new heart.
LINE 157: "All the same," said the Scarecrow, "I shall ask for brains instead of
LINE 158: a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had
LINE 159: one."
LINE 160: "I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman; "for brains do not
LINE 161: make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world."
LINE 162: Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her
LINE 163: two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to
LINE 164: Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had
LINE 165: no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.
LINE 166: What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another
LINE 167: meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither
LINE 168: the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made
LINE 169: of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.
