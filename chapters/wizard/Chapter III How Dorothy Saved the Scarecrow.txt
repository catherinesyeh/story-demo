LINE 1: When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to
LINE 2: the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.
LINE 3: She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it
LINE 4: down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.
LINE 5: Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting
LINE 6: there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging
LINE 7: from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what
LINE 8: she wanted to help out her breakfast.
LINE 9: Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to
LINE 10: a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for
LINE 11: the journey to the City of Emeralds.
LINE 12: Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was
LINE 13: hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white
LINE 14: and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,
LINE 15: it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed
LINE 16: herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.
LINE 17: She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,
LINE 18: laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and
LINE 19: noticed how old and worn her shoes were.
LINE 20: "They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto," she said. And
LINE 21: Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his
LINE 22: tail to show he knew what she meant.
LINE 23: At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had
LINE 24: belonged to the Witch of the East.
LINE 25: "I wonder if they will fit me," she said to Toto. "They would be just
LINE 26: the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out."
LINE 27: She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which
LINE 28: fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.
LINE 29: Finally she picked up her basket.
LINE 30: "Come along, Toto," she said. "We will go to the Emerald City and ask
LINE 31: the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again."
LINE 32: She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket
LINE 33: of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she
LINE 34: started on her journey.
LINE 35: There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find
LINE 36: the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking
LINE 37: briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on
LINE 38: the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang
LINE 39: sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a
LINE 40: little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own
LINE 41: country and set down in the midst of a strange land.
LINE 42: She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country
LINE 43: was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted
LINE 44: a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and
LINE 45: vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and
LINE 46: able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and
LINE 47: the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for
LINE 48: everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and
LINE 49: setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were
LINE 50: odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.
LINE 51: All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the
LINE 52: favorite color.
LINE 53: Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to
LINE 54: wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather
LINE 55: larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women
LINE 56: were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and
LINE 57: the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was
LINE 58: loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other
LINE 59: good things to eat.
LINE 60: The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to
LINE 61: pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest
LINE 62: Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to
LINE 63: celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.
LINE 64: Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin
LINE 65: himself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the
LINE 66: people dance.
LINE 67: When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, "You must be a great sorceress."
LINE 68: "Why?" asked the girl.
LINE 69: "Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.
LINE 70: Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses
LINE 71: wear white."
LINE 72: "My dress is blue and white checked," said Dorothy, smoothing out the
LINE 73: wrinkles in it.
LINE 74: "It is kind of you to wear that," said Boq. "Blue is the color of the
LINE 75: Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly
LINE 76: witch."
LINE 77: Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to
LINE 78: think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary
LINE 79: little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange
LINE 80: land.
LINE 81: When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,
LINE 82: where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made
LINE 83: of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with
LINE 84: Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.
LINE 85: She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played
LINE 86: with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that
LINE 87: greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,
LINE 88: for they had never seen a dog before.
LINE 89: "How far is it to the Emerald City?" the girl asked.
LINE 90: "I do not know," answered Boq gravely, "for I have never been there. It
LINE 91: is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business
LINE 92: with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take
LINE 93: you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass
LINE 94: through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your
LINE 95: journey."
LINE 96: This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz
LINE 97: could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn
LINE 98: back.
LINE 99: She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of
LINE 100: yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would
LINE 101: stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road
LINE 102: and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far
LINE 103: away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from
LINE 104: the ripe corn.
LINE 105: Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the
LINE 106: Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,
LINE 107: nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue
LINE 108: hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and
LINE 109: the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,
LINE 110: which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots
LINE 111: with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure
LINE 112: was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its
LINE 113: back.
LINE 114: While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the
LINE 115: Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.
LINE 116: She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the
LINE 117: scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its
LINE 118: head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and
LINE 119: walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.
LINE 120: "Good day," said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.
LINE 121: "Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder.
LINE 122: "Certainly," answered the Scarecrow. "How do you do?"
LINE 123: "I'm pretty well, thank you," replied Dorothy politely. "How do you
LINE 124: do?"
LINE 125: "I'm not feeling well," said the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is
LINE 126: very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows."
LINE 127: "Can't you get down?" asked Dorothy.
LINE 128: "No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away
LINE 129: the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you."
LINE 130: Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,
LINE 131: being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.
LINE 132: "Thank you very much," said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on
LINE 133: the ground. "I feel like a new man."
LINE 134: Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man
LINE 135: speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.
LINE 136: "Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and
LINE 137: yawned. "And where are you going?"
LINE 138: "My name is Dorothy," said the girl, "and I am going to the Emerald
LINE 139: City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas."
LINE 140: "Where is the Emerald City?" he inquired. "And who is Oz?"
LINE 141: "Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise.
LINE 142: "No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no
LINE 143: brains at all," he answered sadly.
LINE 144: "Oh," said Dorothy, "I'm awfully sorry for you."
LINE 145: "Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the Emerald City with you, that
LINE 146: Oz would give me some brains?"
LINE 147: "I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like.
LINE 148: If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you
LINE 149: are now."
LINE 150: "That is true," said the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued
LINE 151: confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,
LINE 152: because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin
LINE 153: into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want
LINE 154: people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw
LINE 155: instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"
LINE 156: "I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry
LINE 157: for him. "If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for
LINE 158: you."
LINE 159: "Thank you," he answered gratefully.
LINE 160: They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and
LINE 161: they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.
LINE 162: Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled
LINE 163: around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats
LINE 164: in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the
LINE 165: Scarecrow.
LINE 166: "Don't mind Toto," said Dorothy to her new friend. "He never bites."
LINE 167: "Oh, I'm not afraid," replied the Scarecrow. "He can't hurt the straw.
LINE 168: Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't
LINE 169: get tired. I'll tell you a secret," he continued, as he walked along.
LINE 170: "There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of."
LINE 171: "What is that?" asked Dorothy; "the Munchkin farmer who made you?"
LINE 172: "No," answered the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted match."
