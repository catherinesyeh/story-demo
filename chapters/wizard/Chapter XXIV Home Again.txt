LINE 5: "From the Land of Oz," said Dorothy gravely. "And here is Toto, too.
LINE 6: And oh, Aunt Em! I'm so glad to be at home again!"

LINE 11: Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
LINE 12: law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
LINE 13: so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
LINE 14: States without permission and without paying copyright
LINE 15: royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
LINE 16: of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
LINE 17: Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
LINE 18: concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
LINE 19: and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
LINE 20: the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
LINE 21: of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
LINE 22: copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
LINE 23: easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
LINE 24: of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
LINE 25: Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
LINE 26: do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

LINE 237: electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
LINE 238: computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
LINE 239: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
LINE 240: from people in all walks of life.
LINE 241: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
LINE 242: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
LINE 243: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
LINE 244: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
LINE 245: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
LINE 246: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
LINE 247: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 248: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
LINE 249: Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 250: Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

LINE 252: 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
LINE 253: state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
LINE 254: Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
LINE 255: number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

LINE 262: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
LINE 263: Literary Archive Foundation
LINE 264: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
LINE 265: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
LINE 266: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
LINE 267: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
LINE 268: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
LINE 269: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
LINE 270: status with the IRS.
LINE 271: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
LINE 272: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
LINE 273: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
LINE 274: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
LINE 275: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
LINE 276: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
LINE 277: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
LINE 278: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 279: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
LINE 280: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
LINE 281: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
LINE 282: approach us with offers to donate.
LINE 283: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
LINE 284: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
LINE 285: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
LINE 286: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
LINE 287: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
LINE 288: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
LINE 289: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 290: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
LINE 291: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
LINE 292: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
LINE 293: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
LINE 294: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
LINE 295: volunteer support.
LINE 296: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
LINE 297: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
LINE 298: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
LINE 299: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
LINE 300: edition.
LINE 301: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
LINE 302: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 303: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
LINE 304: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 305: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
LINE 306: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
