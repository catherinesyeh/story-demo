LINE 1: SCENE I. A room in the Castle.
LINE 2: Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
LINE 3: KING.
LINE 4: There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
LINE 5: You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
LINE 6: Where is your son?
LINE 7: QUEEN.
LINE 8: Bestow this place on us a little while.
LINE 9: [_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out._]
LINE 10: Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
LINE 11: KING.
LINE 12: What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
LINE 13: QUEEN.
LINE 14: Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
LINE 15: Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
LINE 16: Behind the arras hearing something stir,
LINE 17: Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
LINE 18: And in this brainish apprehension kills
LINE 19: The unseen good old man.
LINE 20: KING.
LINE 21: O heavy deed!
LINE 22: It had been so with us, had we been there.
LINE 23: His liberty is full of threats to all;
LINE 24: To you yourself, to us, to everyone.
LINE 25: Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
LINE 26: It will be laid to us, whose providence
LINE 27: Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
LINE 28: This mad young man. But so much was our love
LINE 29: We would not understand what was most fit,
LINE 30: But like the owner of a foul disease,
LINE 31: To keep it from divulging, let it feed
LINE 32: Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
LINE 33: QUEEN.
LINE 34: To draw apart the body he hath kill'd,
LINE 35: O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
LINE 36: Among a mineral of metals base,
LINE 37: Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
LINE 38: KING.
LINE 39: O Gertrude, come away!
LINE 40: The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
LINE 41: But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed
LINE 42: We must with all our majesty and skill
LINE 43: Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!
LINE 44: Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
LINE 45: Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
LINE 46: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
LINE 47: And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
LINE 48: Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body
LINE 49: Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
LINE 50: [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]
LINE 51: Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends,
LINE 52: And let them know both what we mean to do
LINE 53: And what's untimely done, so haply slander,
LINE 54: Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
LINE 55: As level as the cannon to his blank,
LINE 56: Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
LINE 57: And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
LINE 58: My soul is full of discord and dismay.
LINE 59: [_Exeunt._]
LINE 60: SCENE II. Another room in the Castle.
LINE 61: Enter Hamlet.
LINE 62: HAMLET.
LINE 63: Safely stowed.
LINE 64: ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.
LINE 65: [_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
LINE 66: HAMLET.
LINE 67: What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
LINE 68: Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
LINE 69: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 70: What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
LINE 71: HAMLET.
LINE 72: Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
LINE 73: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 74: Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
LINE 75: And bear it to the chapel.
LINE 76: HAMLET.
LINE 77: Do not believe it.
LINE 78: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 79: Believe what?
LINE 80: HAMLET.
LINE 81: That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded
LINE 82: of a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?
LINE 83: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 84: Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
LINE 85: HAMLET.
LINE 86: Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, his
LINE 87: authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he
LINE 88: keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be
LINE 89: last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but
LINE 90: squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
LINE 91: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 92: I understand you not, my lord.
LINE 93: HAMLET.
LINE 94: I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
LINE 95: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 96: My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
LINE 97: HAMLET.
LINE 98: The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King
LINE 99: is a thing—
LINE 100: GUILDENSTERN.
LINE 101: A thing, my lord!
LINE 102: HAMLET.
LINE 103: Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
LINE 104: [_Exeunt._]
LINE 105: SCENE III. Another room in the Castle.
LINE 106: Enter King, attended.
LINE 107: KING.
LINE 108: I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
LINE 109: How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
LINE 110: Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
LINE 111: He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
LINE 112: Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes;
LINE 113: And where 'tis so, th'offender's scourge is weigh'd,
LINE 114: But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
LINE 115: This sudden sending him away must seem
LINE 116: Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
LINE 117: By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
LINE 118: Or not at all.
LINE 119: Enter Rosencrantz.
LINE 120: How now? What hath befall'n?
LINE 121: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 122: Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
LINE 123: We cannot get from him.
LINE 124: KING.
LINE 125: But where is he?
LINE 126: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 127: Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.
LINE 128: KING.
LINE 129: Bring him before us.
LINE 130: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 131: Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
LINE 132: Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.
LINE 133: KING.
LINE 134: Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
LINE 135: HAMLET.
LINE 136: At supper.
LINE 137: KING.
LINE 138: At supper? Where?
LINE 139: HAMLET.
LINE 140: Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of
LINE 141: politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet.
LINE 142: We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.
LINE 143: Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes,
LINE 144: but to one table. That's the end.
LINE 145: KING.
LINE 146: Alas, alas!
LINE 147: HAMLET.
LINE 148: A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the
LINE 149: fish that hath fed of that worm.
LINE 150: KING.
LINE 151: What dost thou mean by this?
LINE 152: HAMLET.
LINE 153: Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts
LINE 154: of a beggar.
LINE 155: KING.
LINE 156: Where is Polonius?
LINE 157: HAMLET.
LINE 158: In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there,
LINE 159: seek him i' th'other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not
LINE 160: within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the
LINE 161: lobby.
LINE 162: KING.
LINE 163: [_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.
LINE 164: HAMLET.
LINE 165: He will stay till you come.
LINE 166: [_Exeunt Attendants._]
LINE 167: KING.
LINE 168: Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—
LINE 169: Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
LINE 170: For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence
LINE 171: With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;
LINE 172: The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
LINE 173: Th'associates tend, and everything is bent
LINE 174: For England.
LINE 175: HAMLET.
LINE 176: For England?
LINE 177: KING.
LINE 178: Ay, Hamlet.
LINE 179: HAMLET.
LINE 180: Good.
LINE 181: KING.
LINE 182: So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
LINE 183: HAMLET.
LINE 184: I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear
LINE 185: mother.
LINE 186: KING.
LINE 187: Thy loving father, Hamlet.
LINE 188: HAMLET.
LINE 189: My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one
LINE 190: flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.
LINE 191: [_Exit._]
LINE 192: KING.
LINE 193: Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;
LINE 194: Delay it not; I'll have him hence tonight.
LINE 195: Away, for everything is seal'd and done
LINE 196: That else leans on th'affair. Pray you make haste.
LINE 197: [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]
LINE 198: And England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,—
LINE 199: As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
LINE 200: Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
LINE 201: After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
LINE 202: Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set
LINE 203: Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
LINE 204: By letters conjuring to that effect,
LINE 205: The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
LINE 206: For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
LINE 207: And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
LINE 208: Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
LINE 209: [_Exit._]
LINE 210: SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
LINE 211: Enter Fortinbras and Forces marching.
LINE 212: FORTINBRAS.
LINE 213: Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
LINE 214: Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
LINE 215: Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
LINE 216: Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
LINE 217: If that his Majesty would aught with us,
LINE 218: We shall express our duty in his eye;
LINE 219: And let him know so.
LINE 220: CAPTAIN.
LINE 221: I will do't, my lord.
LINE 222: FORTINBRAS.
LINE 223: Go softly on.
LINE 224: [_Exeunt all but the Captain._]
LINE 225: Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.
LINE 226: HAMLET.
LINE 227: Good sir, whose powers are these?
LINE 228: CAPTAIN.
LINE 229: They are of Norway, sir.
LINE 230: HAMLET.
LINE 231: How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
LINE 232: CAPTAIN.
LINE 233: Against some part of Poland.
LINE 234: HAMLET.
LINE 235: Who commands them, sir?
LINE 236: CAPTAIN.
LINE 237: The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
LINE 238: HAMLET.
LINE 239: Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
LINE 240: Or for some frontier?
LINE 241: CAPTAIN.
LINE 242: Truly to speak, and with no addition,
LINE 243: We go to gain a little patch of ground
LINE 244: That hath in it no profit but the name.
LINE 245: To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
LINE 246: Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
LINE 247: A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
LINE 248: HAMLET.
LINE 249: Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
LINE 250: CAPTAIN.
LINE 251: Yes, it is already garrison'd.
LINE 252: HAMLET.
LINE 253: Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
LINE 254: Will not debate the question of this straw!
LINE 255: This is th'imposthume of much wealth and peace,
LINE 256: That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
LINE 257: Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
LINE 258: CAPTAIN.
LINE 259: God b' wi' you, sir.
LINE 260: [_Exit._]
LINE 261: ROSENCRANTZ.
LINE 262: Will't please you go, my lord?
LINE 263: HAMLET.
LINE 264: I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
LINE 265: [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]
LINE 266: How all occasions do inform against me,
LINE 267: And spur my dull revenge. What is a man
LINE 268: If his chief good and market of his time
LINE 269: Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
LINE 270: Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
LINE 271: Looking before and after, gave us not
LINE 272: That capability and godlike reason
LINE 273: To fust in us unus'd. Now whether it be
LINE 274: Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
LINE 275: Of thinking too precisely on th'event,—
LINE 276: A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
LINE 277: And ever three parts coward,—I do not know
LINE 278: Why yet I live to say this thing's to do,
LINE 279: Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
LINE 280: To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me,
LINE 281: Witness this army of such mass and charge,
LINE 282: Led by a delicate and tender prince,
LINE 283: Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
LINE 284: Makes mouths at the invisible event,
LINE 285: Exposing what is mortal and unsure
LINE 286: To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
LINE 287: Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
LINE 288: Is not to stir without great argument,
LINE 289: But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
LINE 290: When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
LINE 291: That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
LINE 292: Excitements of my reason and my blood,
LINE 293: And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
LINE 294: The imminent death of twenty thousand men
LINE 295: That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
LINE 296: Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
LINE 297: Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
LINE 298: Which is not tomb enough and continent
LINE 299: To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
LINE 300: My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.
LINE 301: [_Exit._]
LINE 302: SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
LINE 303: Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.
LINE 304: QUEEN.
LINE 305: I will not speak with her.
LINE 306: GENTLEMAN.
LINE 307: She is importunate, indeed distract.
LINE 308: Her mood will needs be pitied.
LINE 309: QUEEN.
LINE 310: What would she have?
LINE 311: GENTLEMAN.
LINE 312: She speaks much of her father; says she hears
LINE 313: There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
LINE 314: Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt,
LINE 315: That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
LINE 316: Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
LINE 317: The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
LINE 318: And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,
LINE 319: Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
LINE 320: Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
LINE 321: Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
LINE 322: 'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew
LINE 323: Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
LINE 324: QUEEN.
LINE 325: Let her come in.
LINE 326: [_Exit Gentleman._]
LINE 327: To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
LINE 328: Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
LINE 329: So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
LINE 330: It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
LINE 331: Enter Ophelia.
LINE 332: OPHELIA.
LINE 333: Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
LINE 334: QUEEN.
LINE 335: How now, Ophelia?
LINE 336: OPHELIA.
LINE 337: [_Sings._]
LINE 338: How should I your true love know
LINE 339: From another one?
LINE 340: By his cockle hat and staff
LINE 341: And his sandal shoon.
LINE 342: QUEEN.
LINE 343: Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
LINE 344: OPHELIA.
LINE 345: Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
LINE 346: [_Sings._]
LINE 347: He is dead and gone, lady,
LINE 348: He is dead and gone,
LINE 349: At his head a grass green turf,
LINE 350: At his heels a stone.
LINE 351: QUEEN.
LINE 352: Nay, but Ophelia—
LINE 353: OPHELIA.
LINE 354: Pray you mark.
LINE 355: [_Sings._]
LINE 356: White his shroud as the mountain snow.
LINE 357: Enter King.
LINE 358: QUEEN.
LINE 359: Alas, look here, my lord!
LINE 360: OPHELIA.
LINE 361: [_Sings._]
LINE 362: Larded all with sweet flowers;
LINE 363: Which bewept to the grave did not go
LINE 364: With true-love showers.
LINE 365: KING.
LINE 366: How do you, pretty lady?
LINE 367: OPHELIA.
LINE 368: Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we
LINE 369: know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!
LINE 370: KING.
LINE 371: Conceit upon her father.
LINE 372: OPHELIA.
LINE 373: Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it
LINE 374: means, say you this:
LINE 375: [_Sings._]
LINE 376: Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,
LINE 377: All in the morning betime,
LINE 378: And I a maid at your window,
LINE 379: To be your Valentine.
LINE 380: Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
LINE 381: And dupp'd the chamber door,
LINE 382: Let in the maid, that out a maid
LINE 383: Never departed more.
LINE 384: KING.
LINE 385: Pretty Ophelia!
LINE 386: OPHELIA.
LINE 387: Indeed la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't.
LINE 388: [_Sings._]
LINE 389: By Gis and by Saint Charity,
LINE 390: Alack, and fie for shame!
LINE 391: Young men will do't if they come to't;
LINE 392: By Cock, they are to blame.
LINE 393: Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
LINE 394: You promis'd me to wed.
LINE 395: So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
LINE 396: An thou hadst not come to my bed.
LINE 397: KING.
LINE 398: How long hath she been thus?
LINE 399: OPHELIA.
LINE 400: I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but
LINE 401: weep, to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground. My brother shall
LINE 402: know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach!
LINE 403: Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.
LINE 404: [_Exit._]
LINE 405: KING.
LINE 406: Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
LINE 407: [_Exit Horatio._]
LINE 408: O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
LINE 409: All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
LINE 410: When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
LINE 411: But in battalions. First, her father slain;
LINE 412: Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
LINE 413: Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
LINE 414: Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
LINE 415: For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
LINE 416: In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia
LINE 417: Divided from herself and her fair judgement,
LINE 418: Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.
LINE 419: Last, and as much containing as all these,
LINE 420: Her brother is in secret come from France,
LINE 421: Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
LINE 422: And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
LINE 423: With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
LINE 424: Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
LINE 425: Will nothing stick our person to arraign
LINE 426: In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
LINE 427: Like to a murdering piece, in many places
LINE 428: Gives me superfluous death.
LINE 429: [_A noise within._]
LINE 430: QUEEN.
LINE 431: Alack, what noise is this?
LINE 432: KING.
LINE 433: Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
LINE 434: Enter a Gentleman.
LINE 435: What is the matter?
LINE 436: GENTLEMAN.
LINE 437: Save yourself, my lord.
LINE 438: The ocean, overpeering of his list,
LINE 439: Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
LINE 440: Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
LINE 441: O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,
LINE 442: And, as the world were now but to begin,
LINE 443: Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
LINE 444: The ratifiers and props of every word,
LINE 445: They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
LINE 446: Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
LINE 447: 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.'
LINE 448: QUEEN.
LINE 449: How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.
LINE 450: O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.
LINE 451: [_A noise within._]
LINE 452: KING.
LINE 453: The doors are broke.
LINE 454: Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.
LINE 455: LAERTES.
LINE 456: Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.
LINE 457: Danes.
LINE 458: No, let's come in.
LINE 459: LAERTES.
LINE 460: I pray you, give me leave.
LINE 461: DANES.
LINE 462: We will, we will.
LINE 463: [_They retire without the door._]
LINE 464: LAERTES.
LINE 465: I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,
LINE 466: Give me my father.
LINE 467: QUEEN.
LINE 468: Calmly, good Laertes.
LINE 469: LAERTES.
LINE 470: That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
LINE 471: Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
LINE 472: Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
LINE 473: Of my true mother.
LINE 474: KING.
LINE 475: What is the cause, Laertes,
LINE 476: That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—
LINE 477: Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
LINE 478: There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
LINE 479: That treason can but peep to what it would,
LINE 480: Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,
LINE 481: Why thou art thus incens'd.—Let him go, Gertrude:—
LINE 482: Speak, man.
LINE 483: LAERTES.
LINE 484: Where is my father?
LINE 485: KING.
LINE 486: Dead.
LINE 487: QUEEN.
LINE 488: But not by him.
LINE 489: KING.
LINE 490: Let him demand his fill.
LINE 491: LAERTES.
LINE 492: How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.
LINE 493: To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!
LINE 494: Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
LINE 495: I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
LINE 496: That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
LINE 497: Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
LINE 498: Most throughly for my father.
LINE 499: KING.
LINE 500: Who shall stay you?
LINE 501: LAERTES.
LINE 502: My will, not all the world.
LINE 503: And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
LINE 504: They shall go far with little.
LINE 505: KING.
LINE 506: Good Laertes,
LINE 507: If you desire to know the certainty
LINE 508: Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
LINE 509: That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
LINE 510: Winner and loser?
LINE 511: LAERTES.
LINE 512: None but his enemies.
LINE 513: KING.
LINE 514: Will you know them then?
LINE 515: LAERTES.
LINE 516: To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
LINE 517: And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
LINE 518: Repast them with my blood.
LINE 519: KING.
LINE 520: Why, now you speak
LINE 521: Like a good child and a true gentleman.
LINE 522: That I am guiltless of your father's death,
LINE 523: And am most sensibly in grief for it,
LINE 524: It shall as level to your judgement 'pear
LINE 525: As day does to your eye.
LINE 526: DANES.
LINE 527: [_Within._] Let her come in.
LINE 528: LAERTES.
LINE 529: How now! What noise is that?
LINE 530: Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.
LINE 531: O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,
LINE 532: Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.
LINE 533: By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
LINE 534: Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
LINE 535: Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
LINE 536: O heavens, is't possible a young maid's wits
LINE 537: Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
LINE 538: Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
LINE 539: It sends some precious instance of itself
LINE 540: After the thing it loves.
LINE 541: OPHELIA.
LINE 542: [_Sings._]
LINE 543: They bore him barefac'd on the bier,
LINE 544: Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny
LINE 545: And on his grave rain'd many a tear.—
LINE 546: Fare you well, my dove!
LINE 547: LAERTES.
LINE 548: Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
LINE 549: It could not move thus.
LINE 550: OPHELIA.
LINE 551: You must sing 'Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O, how the
LINE 552: wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's
LINE 553: daughter.
LINE 554: LAERTES.
LINE 555: This nothing's more than matter.
LINE 556: OPHELIA.
LINE 557: There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray love, remember. And
LINE 558: there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
LINE 559: LAERTES.
LINE 560: A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
LINE 561: OPHELIA.
LINE 562: There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you; and here's
LINE 563: some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O you must wear
LINE 564: your rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you some
LINE 565: violets, but they wither'd all when my father died. They say he made a
LINE 566: good end.
LINE 567: [_Sings._]
LINE 568: For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
LINE 569: LAERTES.
LINE 570: Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself
LINE 571: She turns to favour and to prettiness.
LINE 572: OPHELIA.
LINE 573: [_Sings._]
LINE 574: And will he not come again?
LINE 575: And will he not come again?
LINE 576: No, no, he is dead,
LINE 577: Go to thy death-bed,
LINE 578: He never will come again.
LINE 579: His beard was as white as snow,
LINE 580: All flaxen was his poll.
LINE 581: He is gone, he is gone,
LINE 582: And we cast away moan.
LINE 583: God ha' mercy on his soul.
LINE 584: And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' ye.
LINE 585: [_Exit._]
LINE 586: LAERTES.
LINE 587: Do you see this, O God?
LINE 588: KING.
LINE 589: Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
LINE 590: Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
LINE 591: Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
LINE 592: And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
LINE 593: If by direct or by collateral hand
LINE 594: They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
LINE 595: Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours
LINE 596: To you in satisfaction; but if not,
LINE 597: Be you content to lend your patience to us,
LINE 598: And we shall jointly labour with your soul
LINE 599: To give it due content.
LINE 600: LAERTES.
LINE 601: Let this be so;
LINE 602: His means of death, his obscure burial,—
LINE 603: No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
LINE 604: No noble rite, nor formal ostentation,—
LINE 605: Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
LINE 606: That I must call't in question.
LINE 607: KING.
LINE 608: So you shall.
LINE 609: And where th'offence is let the great axe fall.
LINE 610: I pray you go with me.
LINE 611: [_Exeunt._]
LINE 612: SCENE VI. Another room in the Castle.
LINE 613: Enter Horatio and a Servant.
LINE 614: HORATIO.
LINE 615: What are they that would speak with me?
LINE 616: SERVANT.
LINE 617: Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.
LINE 618: HORATIO.
LINE 619: Let them come in.
LINE 620: [_Exit Servant._]
LINE 621: I do not know from what part of the world
LINE 622: I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
LINE 623: Enter Sailors.
LINE 624: FIRST SAILOR.
LINE 625: God bless you, sir.
LINE 626: HORATIO.
LINE 627: Let him bless thee too.
LINE 628: FIRST SAILOR.
LINE 629: He shall, sir, and't please him. There's a letter for you, sir. It
LINE 630: comes from th'ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be
LINE 631: Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
LINE 632: HORATIO.
LINE 633: [_Reads._] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these
LINE 634: fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were
LINE 635: two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
LINE 636: chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled
LINE 637: valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got
LINE 638: clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt
LINE 639: with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do
LINE 640: a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and
LINE 641: repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have
LINE 642: words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
LINE 643: light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
LINE 644: where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:
LINE 645: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
LINE 646: He that thou knowest thine,
LINE 647: HAMLET.'
LINE 648: Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
LINE 649: And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
LINE 650: To him from whom you brought them.
LINE 651: [_Exeunt._]
LINE 652: SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.
LINE 653: Enter King and Laertes.
LINE 654: KING.
LINE 655: Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
LINE 656: And you must put me in your heart for friend,
LINE 657: Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
LINE 658: That he which hath your noble father slain
LINE 659: Pursu'd my life.
LINE 660: LAERTES.
LINE 661: It well appears. But tell me
LINE 662: Why you proceeded not against these feats,
LINE 663: So crimeful and so capital in nature,
LINE 664: As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
LINE 665: You mainly were stirr'd up.
LINE 666: KING.
LINE 667: O, for two special reasons,
LINE 668: Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
LINE 669: But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
LINE 670: Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,—
LINE 671: My virtue or my plague, be it either which,—
LINE 672: She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
LINE 673: That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
LINE 674: I could not but by her. The other motive,
LINE 675: Why to a public count I might not go,
LINE 676: Is the great love the general gender bear him,
LINE 677: Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
LINE 678: Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
LINE 679: Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
LINE 680: Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
LINE 681: Would have reverted to my bow again,
LINE 682: And not where I had aim'd them.
LINE 683: LAERTES.
LINE 684: And so have I a noble father lost,
LINE 685: A sister driven into desperate terms,
LINE 686: Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
LINE 687: Stood challenger on mount of all the age
LINE 688: For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
LINE 689: KING.
LINE 690: Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
LINE 691: That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
LINE 692: That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
LINE 693: And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
LINE 694: I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
LINE 695: And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—
LINE 696: Enter a Messenger.
LINE 697: How now? What news?
LINE 698: MESSENGER.
LINE 699: Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
LINE 700: This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
LINE 701: KING.
LINE 702: From Hamlet! Who brought them?
LINE 703: MESSENGER.
LINE 704: Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
LINE 705: They were given me by Claudio. He receiv'd them
LINE 706: Of him that brought them.
LINE 707: KING.
LINE 708: Laertes, you shall hear them.
LINE 709: Leave us.
LINE 710: [_Exit Messenger._]
LINE 711: [_Reads._] 'High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
LINE 712: kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I
LINE 713: shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my
LINE 714: sudden and more strange return.
LINE 715: HAMLET.'
LINE 716: What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
LINE 717: Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
LINE 718: LAERTES.
LINE 719: Know you the hand?
LINE 720: KING.
LINE 721: 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
LINE 722: And in a postscript here he says 'alone.'
LINE 723: Can you advise me?
LINE 724: LAERTES.
LINE 725: I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,
LINE 726: It warms the very sickness in my heart
LINE 727: That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
LINE 728: 'Thus diest thou.'
LINE 729: KING.
LINE 730: If it be so, Laertes,—
LINE 731: As how should it be so? How otherwise?—
LINE 732: Will you be rul'd by me?
LINE 733: LAERTES.
LINE 734: Ay, my lord;
LINE 735: So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
LINE 736: KING.
LINE 737: To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
LINE 738: As checking at his voyage, and that he means
LINE 739: No more to undertake it, I will work him
LINE 740: To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
LINE 741: Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
LINE 742: And for his death no wind shall breathe,
LINE 743: But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
LINE 744: And call it accident.
LINE 745: LAERTES.
LINE 746: My lord, I will be rul'd;
LINE 747: The rather if you could devise it so
LINE 748: That I might be the organ.
LINE 749: KING.
LINE 750: It falls right.
LINE 751: You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
LINE 752: And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
LINE 753: Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
LINE 754: Did not together pluck such envy from him
LINE 755: As did that one, and that, in my regard,
LINE 756: Of the unworthiest siege.
LINE 757: LAERTES.
LINE 758: What part is that, my lord?
LINE 759: KING.
LINE 760: A very riband in the cap of youth,
LINE 761: Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes
LINE 762: The light and careless livery that it wears
LINE 763: Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
LINE 764: Importing health and graveness. Two months since
LINE 765: Here was a gentleman of Normandy,—
LINE 766: I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
LINE 767: And they can well on horseback, but this gallant
LINE 768: Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
LINE 769: And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
LINE 770: As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
LINE 771: With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
LINE 772: That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,
LINE 773: Come short of what he did.
LINE 774: LAERTES.
LINE 775: A Norman was't?
LINE 776: KING.
LINE 777: A Norman.
LINE 778: LAERTES.
LINE 779: Upon my life, Lamord.
LINE 780: KING.
LINE 781: The very same.
LINE 782: LAERTES.
LINE 783: I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
LINE 784: And gem of all the nation.
LINE 785: KING.
LINE 786: He made confession of you,
LINE 787: And gave you such a masterly report
LINE 788: For art and exercise in your defence,
LINE 789: And for your rapier most especially,
LINE 790: That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
LINE 791: If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
LINE 792: He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
LINE 793: If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
LINE 794: Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
LINE 795: That he could nothing do but wish and beg
LINE 796: Your sudden coming o'er to play with him.
LINE 797: Now, out of this,—
LINE 798: LAERTES.
LINE 799: What out of this, my lord?
LINE 800: KING.
LINE 801: Laertes, was your father dear to you?
LINE 802: Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
LINE 803: A face without a heart?
LINE 804: LAERTES.
LINE 805: Why ask you this?
LINE 806: KING.
LINE 807: Not that I think you did not love your father,
LINE 808: But that I know love is begun by time,
LINE 809: And that I see, in passages of proof,
LINE 810: Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
LINE 811: There lives within the very flame of love
LINE 812: A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
LINE 813: And nothing is at a like goodness still,
LINE 814: For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,
LINE 815: Dies in his own too much. That we would do,
LINE 816: We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
LINE 817: And hath abatements and delays as many
LINE 818: As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
LINE 819: And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
LINE 820: That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th'ulcer:
LINE 821: Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
LINE 822: To show yourself your father's son in deed,
LINE 823: More than in words?
LINE 824: LAERTES.
LINE 825: To cut his throat i' th' church.
LINE 826: KING.
LINE 827: No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
LINE 828: Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,
LINE 829: Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
LINE 830: Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
LINE 831: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence,
LINE 832: And set a double varnish on the fame
LINE 833: The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
LINE 834: And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
LINE 835: Most generous, and free from all contriving,
LINE 836: Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
LINE 837: Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
LINE 838: A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,
LINE 839: Requite him for your father.
LINE 840: LAERTES.
LINE 841: I will do't.
LINE 842: And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
LINE 843: I bought an unction of a mountebank
LINE 844: So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
LINE 845: Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
LINE 846: Collected from all simples that have virtue
LINE 847: Under the moon, can save the thing from death
LINE 848: This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
LINE 849: With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
LINE 850: It may be death.
LINE 851: KING.
LINE 852: Let's further think of this,
LINE 853: Weigh what convenience both of time and means
LINE 854: May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,
LINE 855: And that our drift look through our bad performance.
LINE 856: 'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
LINE 857: Should have a back or second, that might hold
LINE 858: If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.
LINE 859: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—
LINE 860: I ha't! When in your motion you are hot and dry,
LINE 861: As make your bouts more violent to that end,
LINE 862: And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
LINE 863: A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
LINE 864: If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
LINE 865: Our purpose may hold there.
LINE 866: Enter Queen.
LINE 867: How now, sweet Queen?
LINE 868: QUEEN.
LINE 869: One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
LINE 870: So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
LINE 871: LAERTES.
LINE 872: Drown'd! O, where?
LINE 873: QUEEN.
LINE 874: There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
LINE 875: That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.
LINE 876: There with fantastic garlands did she make
LINE 877: Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
LINE 878: That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
LINE 879: But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
LINE 880: There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
LINE 881: Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
LINE 882: When down her weedy trophies and herself
LINE 883: Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
LINE 884: And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,
LINE 885: Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
LINE 886: As one incapable of her own distress,
LINE 887: Or like a creature native and indued
LINE 888: Unto that element. But long it could not be
LINE 889: Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
LINE 890: Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
LINE 891: To muddy death.
LINE 892: LAERTES.
LINE 893: Alas, then she is drown'd?
LINE 894: QUEEN.
LINE 895: Drown'd, drown'd.
LINE 896: LAERTES.
LINE 897: Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
LINE 898: And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet
LINE 899: It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
LINE 900: Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
LINE 901: The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,
LINE 902: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
LINE 903: But that this folly douts it.
LINE 904: [_Exit._]
LINE 905: KING.
LINE 906: Let's follow, Gertrude;
LINE 907: How much I had to do to calm his rage!
LINE 908: Now fear I this will give it start again;
LINE 909: Therefore let's follow.
LINE 910: [_Exeunt._]
