LINE 1: ARGUMENT
LINE 2: THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS
LINE 3: Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
LINE 4: entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks
LINE 5: with Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time
LINE 6: charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further
LINE 7: pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are
LINE 8: described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend,
LINE 9: after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at
LINE 10: the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero,
LINE 11: are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the
LINE 12: vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was
LINE 13: averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are
LINE 14: described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of
LINE 15: Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses
LINE 16: and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which
LINE 17: concludes the book.
LINE 18: So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,
LINE 19: While the black vessels smoked with human gore.
LINE 20: Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;
LINE 21: The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.
LINE 22: Not faster, trickling to the plains below,
LINE 23: From the tall rock the sable waters flow.
LINE 24: Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.
LINE 25: Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:[243]
LINE 26: "Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,
LINE 27: That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?
LINE 28: No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps
LINE 29: From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;
LINE 30: Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,
LINE 31: Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,
LINE 32: Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end
LINE 33: Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?
LINE 34: "Griev'st thou for me, or for my martial band?
LINE 35: Or come sad tidings from our native land?
LINE 36: Our fathers live (our first, most tender care),
LINE 37: Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,
LINE 38: And hoary Peleus yet extends his days;
LINE 39: Pleased in their age to hear their children's praise.
LINE 40: Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?
LINE 41: Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,
LINE 42: Doom'd in their ships to sink by fire and sword,
LINE 43: And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?
LINE 44: Whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care,
LINE 45: And speak those sorrows which a friend would share."
LINE 46: A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,
LINE 47: Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke:
LINE 48: "Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,
LINE 49: Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!
LINE 50: Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,
LINE 51: Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:
LINE 52: Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus' son,
LINE 53: And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,
LINE 54: More for their country's wounds than for their own.
LINE 55: Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,
LINE 56: Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.
LINE 57: May never rage like thine my soul enslave,
LINE 58: O great in vain! unprofitably brave!
LINE 59: Thy country slighted in her last distress,
LINE 60: What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?
LINE 61: No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,
LINE 62: Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.
LINE 63: "O man unpitying! if of man thy race;
LINE 64: But sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,
LINE 65: Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,
LINE 66: Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:
LINE 67: Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,
LINE 68: And raging seas produced thee in a storm,
LINE 69: A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,
LINE 70: So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.
LINE 71: "If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,
LINE 72: If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,
LINE 73: Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,
LINE 74: If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:
LINE 75: Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,
LINE 76: Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war;
LINE 77: Without thy person Greece shall win the day,
LINE 78: And thy mere image chase her foes away.
LINE 79: Press'd by fresh forces, her o'erlabour'd train
LINE 80: Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again."
LINE 81: Thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,
LINE 82: Thou begg'st his arms, and in his arms thy death.
LINE 83: Unfortunately good! a boding sigh
LINE 84: Thy friend return'd; and with it, this reply:
LINE 85: "Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;
LINE 86: Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears;
LINE 87: Nor aught a mother's caution can suggest;
LINE 88: The tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.
LINE 89: My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,
LINE 90: Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:
LINE 91: I made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong
LINE 92: Even me: I felt it; and shall feel it long.
LINE 93: The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,
LINE 94: Due to the toils of many a well-fought day;
LINE 95: Due to my conquest of her father's reign;
LINE 96: Due to the votes of all the Grecian train.
LINE 97: From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,
LINE 98: Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the meanest slave.
LINE 99: But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past;
LINE 100: 'Tis time our fury should relent at last:
LINE 101: I fix'd its date; the day I wish'd appears:
LINE 102: How Hector to my ships his battle bears,
LINE 103: The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.
LINE 104: Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour's charms
LINE 105: In Troy's famed fields, and in Achilles' arms:
LINE 106: Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,
LINE 107: Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.
LINE 108: See the thin relics of their baffled band
LINE 109: At the last edge of yon deserted land!
LINE 110: Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;
LINE 111: How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!
LINE 112: It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,
LINE 113: Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed:
LINE 114: Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,
LINE 115: Yon ample trench had buried half her host.
LINE 116: No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,
LINE 117: Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;
LINE 118: No longer flames the lance of Tydeus' son;
LINE 119: No more your general calls his heroes on:
LINE 120: Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath
LINE 121: Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.
LINE 122: Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:
LINE 123: Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,
LINE 124: And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.
LINE 125: But heed my words, and mark a friend's command,
LINE 126: Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,
LINE 127: And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host
LINE 128: Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:
LINE 129: Rage uncontroll'd through all the hostile crew,
LINE 130: But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.
LINE 131: Though Jove in thunder should command the war,
LINE 132: Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.
LINE 133: The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,
LINE 134: Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race;
LINE 135: Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;
LINE 136: Some god, like Phœbus, ever kind to Troy.
LINE 137: Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,
LINE 138: Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.
LINE 139: O! would to all the immortal powers above,
LINE 140: Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!
LINE 141: That not one Trojan might be left alive,
LINE 142: And not a Greek of all the race survive:
LINE 143: Might only we the vast destruction shun,
LINE 144: And only we destroy the accursed town!"
LINE 145: Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand
LINE 146: Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band.
LINE 147: Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,
LINE 148: So thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd:
LINE 149: On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;
LINE 150: His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;
LINE 151: His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;
LINE 152: And painful sweat from all his members flows.
LINE 153: Spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most;
LINE 154: Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;
LINE 155: Dangers on dangers all around him glow,
LINE 156: And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.
LINE 157: Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,
LINE 158: How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?
LINE 159: Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,
LINE 160: Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,
LINE 161: Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,
LINE 162: That the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head;
LINE 163: His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;
LINE 164: The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
LINE 165: Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine;
LINE 166: Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,
LINE 167: Warn'd he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour
LINE 168: The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;
LINE 169: O'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,
LINE 170: And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.
LINE 171: Divine Achilles view'd the rising flames,
LINE 172: And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:
LINE 173: "Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!
LINE 174: The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.
LINE 175: Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;
LINE 176: Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;
LINE 177: I haste to bring the troops."—The hero said;
LINE 178: The friend with ardour and with joy obey'd.
LINE 179: He cased his limbs in brass; and first around
LINE 180: His manly legs, with silver buckles bound
LINE 181: The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies
LINE 182: The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;
LINE 183: Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone
LINE 184: In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:
LINE 185: Achilles' shield his ample shoulders spread,
LINE 186: Achilles' helmet nodded o'er his head:
LINE 187: Adorn'd in all his terrible array,
LINE 188: He flash'd around intolerable day.
LINE 189: Alone untouch'd, Pelides' javelin stands,
LINE 190: Not to be poised but by Pelides' hands:
LINE 191: From Pelion's shady brow the plant entire
LINE 192: Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;
LINE 193: Whose son's great arm alone the weapon wields,
LINE 194: The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.
LINE 195: [Illustration: ] Buckles
LINE 196: The brave Automedon (an honour'd name,
LINE 197: The second to his lord in love and fame,
LINE 198: In peace his friend, and partner of the war)
LINE 199: The winged coursers harness'd to the car;
LINE 200: Xanthus and Balius, of immortal breed,
LINE 201: Sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.
LINE 202: Whom the wing'd harpy, swift Podarge, bore,
LINE 203: By Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:
LINE 204: Swift Pedasus was added to their side,
LINE 205: (Once great Aëtion's, now Achilles' pride)
LINE 206: Who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,
LINE 207: A mortal courser match'd the immortal race.
LINE 208: Achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms
LINE 209: His hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.
LINE 210: All breathing death, around the chief they stand,
LINE 211: A grim, terrific, formidable band:
LINE 212: Grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs[244]
LINE 213: When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;
LINE 214: When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,
LINE 215: Has drench'd their wide insatiate throats with blood,
LINE 216: To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,
LINE 217: With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,
LINE 218: Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,
LINE 219: And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.
LINE 220: Like furious, rush'd the Myrmidonian crew,
LINE 221: Such their dread strength, and such their deathful view.
LINE 222: High in the midst the great Achilles stands,
LINE 223: Directs their order, and the war commands.
LINE 224: He, loved of Jove, had launch'd for Ilion's shores
LINE 225: Full fifty vessels, mann'd with fifty oars:
LINE 226: Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey,
LINE 227: Himself supreme in valour, as in sway.
LINE 228: First march'd Menestheus, of celestial birth,
LINE 229: Derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth,
LINE 230: Divine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood!
LINE 231: A mortal mother mixing with a god.
LINE 232: Such was Menestheus, but miscall'd by fame
LINE 233: The son of Borus, that espoused the dame.
LINE 234: Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gay,
LINE 235: Famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day.
LINE 236: Her, sly Cellenius loved: on her would gaze,
LINE 237: As with swift step she form'd the running maze:
LINE 238: To her high chamber from Diana's quire,
LINE 239: The god pursued her, urged, and crown'd his fire.
LINE 240: The son confess'd his father's heavenly race,
LINE 241: And heir'd his mother's swiftness in the chase.
LINE 242: Strong Echecleus, bless'd in all those charms
LINE 243: That pleased a god, succeeded to her arms;
LINE 244: Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame,
LINE 245: With gifts of price he sought and won the dame;
LINE 246: Her secret offspring to her sire she bare;
LINE 247: Her sire caress'd him with a parent's care.
LINE 248: Pisander follow'd; matchless in his art
LINE 249: To wing the spear, or aim the distant dart;
LINE 250: No hand so sure of all the Emathian line,
LINE 251: Or if a surer, great Patroclus! thine.
LINE 252: The fourth by Phœnix' grave command was graced,
LINE 253: Laerces' valiant offspring led the last.
LINE 254: Soon as Achilles with superior care
LINE 255: Had call'd the chiefs, and order'd all the war,
LINE 256: This stern remembrance to his troops he gave:
LINE 257: "Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!
LINE 258: Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng,
LINE 259: Think what reproach these ears endured so long;
LINE 260: 'Stern son of Peleus, (thus ye used to say,
LINE 261: While restless, raging, in your ships you lay)
LINE 262: Oh nursed with gall, unknowing how to yield;
LINE 263: Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field:
LINE 264: If that dire fury must for ever burn,
LINE 265: What make we here? Return, ye chiefs, return!'
LINE 266: Such were your words—Now, warriors! grieve no more,
LINE 267: Lo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore!
LINE 268: This day shall give you all your soul demands,
LINE 269: Glut all your hearts, and weary all your hands!"
LINE 270: [Illustration: ] DIANA
LINE 271: Thus while he roused the fire in every breast,
LINE 272: Close and more close the listening cohorts press'd;
LINE 273: Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring
LINE 274: Still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.
LINE 275: As when a circling wall the builder forms,
LINE 276: Of strength defensive against wind and storms,
LINE 277: Compacted stones the thickening work compose,
LINE 278: And round him wide the rising structure grows:
LINE 279: So helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,
LINE 280: Shield urged on shield, and man drove man along;
LINE 281: Thick, undistinguish'd plumes, together join'd,
LINE 282: Float in one sea, and wave before the wind.
LINE 283: Far o'er the rest in glittering pomp appear,
LINE 284: There bold Automedon, Patroclus here;
LINE 285: Brothers in arms, with equal fury fired;
LINE 286: Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.
LINE 287: But mindful of the gods, Achilles went
LINE 288: To the rich coffer in his shady tent;
LINE 289: There lay on heaps his various garments roll'd,
LINE 290: And costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,
LINE 291: (The presents of the silver-footed dame)
LINE 292: From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,
LINE 293: Which never man had stained with ruddy wine,
LINE 294: Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,
LINE 295: But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none
LINE 296: Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone.
LINE 297: This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,
LINE 298: He purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.
LINE 299: Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space
LINE 300: His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place
LINE 301: Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd
LINE 302: Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:
LINE 303: "O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!
LINE 304: O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove!
LINE 305: Who 'midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,
LINE 306: Presid'st on bleak Dodona's vocal hill:
LINE 307: (Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround,
LINE 308: Their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground;
LINE 309: Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;
LINE 310: And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)
LINE 311: Hear, as of old! Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,
LINE 312: Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair.
LINE 313: Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field
LINE 314: The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,
LINE 315: Though still determined, to my ships confined;
LINE 316: Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.
LINE 317: Oh! be his guard thy providential care,
LINE 318: Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:
LINE 319: Press'd by his single force let Hector see
LINE 320: His fame in arms not owing all to me.
LINE 321: But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,
LINE 322: Let him with conquest and renown retire;
LINE 323: Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,
LINE 324: And safe return him to these eyes again!"
LINE 325: Great Jove consents to half the chief's request,
LINE 326: But heaven's eternal doom denies the rest;
LINE 327: To free the fleet was granted to his prayer;
LINE 328: His safe return, the winds dispersed in air.
LINE 329: Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies,
LINE 330: And waits the combat with impatient eyes.
LINE 331: Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,
LINE 332: Invade the Trojans, and commence the war.
LINE 333: As wasps, provoked by children in their play,
LINE 334: Pour from their mansions by the broad highway,
LINE 335: In swarms the guiltless traveller engage,
LINE 336: Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:
LINE 337: All rise in arms, and, with a general cry,
LINE 338: Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.
LINE 339: Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,
LINE 340: So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:
LINE 341: Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,
LINE 342: Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:
LINE 343: "O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise!
LINE 344: Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;
LINE 345: Your godlike master let your acts proclaim,
LINE 346: And add new glories to his mighty name.
LINE 347: Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave,
LINE 348: And humble the proud monarch whom you save."
LINE 349: Joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,
LINE 350: Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.
LINE 351: From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,
LINE 352: The hollow ships return a deeper sound.
LINE 353: The war stood still, and all around them gazed,
LINE 354: When great Achilles' shining armour blazed:
LINE 355: Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh,
LINE 356: At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.
LINE 357: Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,
LINE 358: Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.
LINE 359: Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore
LINE 360: Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore,
LINE 361: The great Pæonian, bold Pyrechmes stood;
LINE 362: (Who led his bands from Axius' winding flood;)
LINE 363: His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound;
LINE 364: The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.
LINE 365: His troops, that see their country's glory slain,
LINE 366: Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.
LINE 367: Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,
LINE 368: And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires;
LINE 369: Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;
LINE 370: In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;
LINE 371: Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,
LINE 372: And loud acclaim the starry region rends.
LINE 373: So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,
LINE 374: O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;
LINE 375: Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,
LINE 376: Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:
LINE 377: The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,
LINE 378: And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;
LINE 379: The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,
LINE 380: And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.
LINE 381: But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,
LINE 382: Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.
LINE 383: Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,
LINE 384: But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:
LINE 385: As Areilycus had turn'd him round,
LINE 386: Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;
LINE 387: The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,
LINE 388: The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:
LINE 389: Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;
LINE 390: Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.
LINE 391: Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)
LINE 392: His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,
LINE 393: Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;
LINE 394: In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.
LINE 395: In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,
LINE 396: And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:
LINE 397: By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,
LINE 398: Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,
LINE 399: Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,
LINE 400: Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;
LINE 401: Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:
LINE 402: But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,
LINE 403: Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;
LINE 404: His arm falls spouting on the dust below:
LINE 405: He sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:
LINE 406: And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.
LINE 407: Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,
LINE 408: Sarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;
LINE 409: Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,
LINE 410: The bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;
LINE 411: Skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,
LINE 412: And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.
LINE 413: Stopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,
LINE 414: Beneath Oïleus' arm, a living prize;
LINE 415: A living prize not long the Trojan stood;
LINE 416: The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:
LINE 417: Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;
LINE 418: Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.
LINE 419: Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,
LINE 420: Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;
LINE 421: In vain their javelins at each other flew,
LINE 422: Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.
LINE 423: On the plumed crest of his Bœotian foe
LINE 424: The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;
LINE 425: The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped
LINE 426: Full on the juncture of the neck and head:
LINE 427: The head, divided by a stroke so just,
LINE 428: Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.
LINE 429: O'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,
LINE 430: Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
LINE 431: Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:
LINE 432: His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
LINE 433: Next Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,
LINE 434: His open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:
LINE 435: Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,
LINE 436: Crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:
LINE 437: His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;
LINE 438: He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.
LINE 439: As when the flocks neglected by the swain,
LINE 440: Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,
LINE 441: A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,
LINE 442: And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:
LINE 443: Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;
LINE 444: Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.
LINE 445: But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,
LINE 446: Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.
LINE 447: The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,
LINE 448: O'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,
LINE 449: Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,
LINE 450: And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:
LINE 451: He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,
LINE 452: Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.
LINE 453: As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,
LINE 454: And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,
LINE 455: Dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,
LINE 456: And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:
LINE 457: So from the ships, along the dusky plain,
LINE 458: Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.
LINE 459: Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray
LINE 460: The fiery coursers forced their lord away:
LINE 461: While far behind his Trojans fall confused;
LINE 462: Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:
LINE 463: Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes
LINE 464: Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
LINE 465: In vain they labour up the steepy mound;
LINE 466: Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
LINE 467: Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;
LINE 468: Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;
LINE 469: Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;
LINE 470: Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.
LINE 471: The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,
LINE 472: Scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.
LINE 473: Loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry,
LINE 474: Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,
LINE 475: Where horse and arms, and chariots lie o'erthrown,
LINE 476: And bleeding heroes under axles groan.
LINE 477: No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:
LINE 478: From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
LINE 479: High-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car
LINE 480: Smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war,
LINE 481: And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,
LINE 482: Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.
LINE 483: Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,
LINE 484: The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,
LINE 485: Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,
LINE 486: And earth is loaden with incessant showers;
LINE 487: (When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,
LINE 488: Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)
LINE 489: From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,
LINE 490: And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:
LINE 491: The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,
LINE 492: Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away;
LINE 493: Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;
LINE 494: And trembling man sees all his labours vain!
LINE 495: And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd)
LINE 496: Back to the ships his destined progress held,
LINE 497: Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,
LINE 498: And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
LINE 499: Between the space where silver Simois flows,
LINE 500: Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,
LINE 501: All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,
LINE 502: And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
LINE 503: First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,
LINE 504: Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.
LINE 505: Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,
LINE 506: And fell the victim of his coward fear;
LINE 507: Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,
LINE 508: Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;
LINE 509: Patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,
LINE 510: And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,
LINE 511: And dropp'd the flowing reins. Him 'twixt the jaws,
LINE 512: The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.
LINE 513: As on a rock that overhangs the main,
LINE 514: An angler, studious of the line and cane,
LINE 515: Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:
LINE 516: Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
LINE 517: The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,
LINE 518: He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.
LINE 519: Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,
LINE 520: Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:
LINE 521: Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,
LINE 522: And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:
LINE 523: Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,
LINE 524: And death involved him with the shades of hell.
LINE 525: Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;
LINE 526: Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;
LINE 527: Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;
LINE 528: And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.
LINE 529: Where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread
LINE 530: In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.
LINE 531: When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld
LINE 532: Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,
LINE 533: With this reproach his flying host he warms:
LINE 534: "Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!
LINE 535: Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;
LINE 536: This hand unaided shall the war sustain:
LINE 537: The task be mine this hero's strength to try,
LINE 538: Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly."
LINE 539: He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:
LINE 540: Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.
LINE 541: As when two vultures on the mountain's height
LINE 542: Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;
LINE 543: They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;
LINE 544: The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:
LINE 545: The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage
LINE 546: With equal clamours, and with equal rage.
LINE 547: Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,
LINE 548: He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:
LINE 549: "The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,[245]
LINE 550: My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:
LINE 551: Already on the verge of death he stands,
LINE 552: His life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,
LINE 553: What passions in a parent's breast debate!
LINE 554: Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,
LINE 555: And send him safe to Lycia, distant far
LINE 556: From all the dangers and the toils of war;
LINE 557: Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,
LINE 558: And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?"
LINE 559: Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:
LINE 560: "What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!
LINE 561: Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;
LINE 562: Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,
LINE 563: Whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?
LINE 564: How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,
LINE 565: Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!
LINE 566: Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,
LINE 567: And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.
LINE 568: Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;
LINE 569: And when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,
LINE 570: Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,
LINE 571: The breathless body to his native land.
LINE 572: His friends and people, to his future praise,
LINE 573: A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,
LINE 574: And lasting honours to his ashes give;
LINE 575: His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live."
LINE 576: She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,
LINE 577: Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.
LINE 578: Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd
LINE 579: A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:
LINE 580: The god, his eyes averting from the plain,
LINE 581: Laments his son, predestined to be slain,
LINE 582: Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.
LINE 583: Now met in arms, the combatants appear;
LINE 584: Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;
LINE 585: From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,
LINE 586: And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;
LINE 587: The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,
LINE 588: He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.
LINE 589: Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:
LINE 590: The first aloof with erring fury flew,
LINE 591: The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,
LINE 592: The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:
LINE 593: Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,
LINE 594: Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.
LINE 595: His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;
LINE 596: Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:
LINE 597: When bold Automedon, to disengage
LINE 598: The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,
LINE 599: Divides the traces with his sword, and freed
LINE 600: The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:
LINE 601: The rest move on, obedient to the rein:
LINE 602: The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.
LINE 603: The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:
LINE 604: And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,
LINE 605: Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,
LINE 606: And spent in empty air its dying force.
LINE 607: Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;
LINE 608: Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,
LINE 609: Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.
LINE 610: Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,
LINE 611: Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)
LINE 612: Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound
LINE 613: It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,
LINE 614: Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,
LINE 615: Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:
LINE 616: He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
LINE 617: And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.
LINE 618: So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,
LINE 619: While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
LINE 620: The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;
LINE 621: Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.
LINE 622: Then to the leader of the Lycian band
LINE 623: The dying chief address'd his last command;
LINE 624: "Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare
LINE 625: The glorious dangers of destructive war,
LINE 626: To lead my troops, to combat at their head,
LINE 627: Incite the living, and supply the dead.
LINE 628: Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath
LINE 629: Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.
LINE 630: What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,
LINE 631: If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!
LINE 632: Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;
LINE 633: Defend my body, conquer in my right:
LINE 634: That, taught by great examples, all may try
LINE 635: Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die."
LINE 636: He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
LINE 637: And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.
LINE 638: The insulting victor with disdain bestrode
LINE 639: The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;
LINE 640: Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,
LINE 641: The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;
LINE 642: From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,
LINE 643: And the soul issued in the purple flood.
LINE 644: His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,
LINE 645: Unguided now, their mighty master slain.
LINE 646: All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,
LINE 647: Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:
LINE 648: His painful arm, yet useless with the smart
LINE 649: Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,
LINE 650: Supported on his better hand he stay'd:
LINE 651: To Phœbus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:
LINE 652: "All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,
LINE 653: Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,
LINE 654: Powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;
LINE 655: O hear me! god of every healing art!
LINE 656: Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,
LINE 657: That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,
LINE 658: I stand unable to sustain the spear,
LINE 659: And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.
LINE 660: Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,
LINE 661: Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;
LINE 662: But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,
LINE 663: To guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:
LINE 664: For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,
LINE 665: To head my Lycians, and support the fight."
LINE 666: Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,
LINE 667: His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;
LINE 668: He drew the dolours from the wounded part,
LINE 669: And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.
LINE 670: Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,
LINE 671: And owns the assistance of immortal hands.
LINE 672: First to the fight his native troops he warms,
LINE 673: Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;
LINE 674: With ample strides he stalks from place to place;
LINE 675: Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:
LINE 676: Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;
LINE 677: Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.
LINE 678: "What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?
LINE 679: Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!
LINE 680: Those generous friends, who, from their country far,
LINE 681: Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.
LINE 682: See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,
LINE 683: In action valiant, and in council wise,
LINE 684: Who guarded right, and kept his people free;
LINE 685: To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!
LINE 686: Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,
LINE 687: O save from hostile rage his loved remains!
LINE 688: Ah let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,
LINE 689: Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!"
LINE 690: He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:
LINE 691: Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.
LINE 692: Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown
LINE 693: At once his country's pillar, and their own;
LINE 694: A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall
LINE 695: A host of heroes, and outshined them all.
LINE 696: Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,
LINE 697: And with superior vengeance greatly glows.
LINE 698: But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,
LINE 699: And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:
LINE 700: "Heroes, be men; be what you were before;
LINE 701: Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.
LINE 702: The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,
LINE 703: Lies pale in death, extended on the field.
LINE 704: To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;
LINE 705: 'Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.
LINE 706: Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,
LINE 707: And send the living Lycians to the dead."
LINE 708: The heroes kindle at his fierce command;
LINE 709: The martial squadrons close on either hand:
LINE 710: Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,
LINE 711: Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.
LINE 712: With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;
LINE 713: The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.
LINE 714: Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,
LINE 715: O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,
LINE 716: And round his son confounds the warring hosts,
LINE 717: His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.
LINE 718: Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;
LINE 719: Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;
LINE 720: Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
LINE 721: To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;
LINE 722: Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,
LINE 723: He pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.
LINE 724: Soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,
LINE 725: A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;
LINE 726: Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
LINE 727: His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.
LINE 728: Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,
LINE 729: And, like an eagle darting at his game,
LINE 730: Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.
LINE 731: What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,
LINE 732: O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,
LINE 733: At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,
LINE 734: Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near
LINE 735: That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.
LINE 736: Far as an able hand a lance can throw,
LINE 737: Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;
LINE 738: So far the Trojans from their lines retired;
LINE 739: Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.
LINE 740: Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,
LINE 741: The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;
LINE 742: Wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,
LINE 743: With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:
LINE 744: Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue
LINE 745: The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;
LINE 746: Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,
LINE 747: He fell, and falling made the fields resound.
LINE 748: The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;
LINE 749: With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,
LINE 750: And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;
LINE 751: An iron circle round the carcase grows.
LINE 752: Then brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,
LINE 753: Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:
LINE 754: On Ida's holy hill he made abode,
LINE 755: The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.
LINE 756: Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;
LINE 757: The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.
LINE 758: His spear Æneas at the victor threw,
LINE 759: Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;
LINE 760: The lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,
LINE 761: And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;
LINE 762: There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,
LINE 763: Sent by the great Æneas' arm in vain.
LINE 764: "Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)
LINE 765: And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,
LINE 766: My spear, the destined passage had it found,
LINE 767: Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground."
LINE 768: "O valiant leader of the Dardan host!
LINE 769: (Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)
LINE 770: Strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,
LINE 771: An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.
LINE 772: And if to this my lance thy fate be given,
LINE 773: Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:
LINE 774: This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;
LINE 775: Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost."
LINE 776: "O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)
LINE 777: With words to combat, ill befits the brave;
LINE 778: Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,
LINE 779: Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.
LINE 780: To speak, beseems the council; but to dare
LINE 781: In glorious action, is the task of war."
LINE 782: This said, Patroclus to the battle flies;
LINE 783: Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise:
LINE 784: Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;
LINE 785: And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.
LINE 786: As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,
LINE 787: The labours of the woodman's axe resound;
LINE 788: Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,
LINE 789: While crackling forests fall on every side:
LINE 790: Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,
LINE 791: So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.
LINE 792: Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,
LINE 793: His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,
LINE 794: And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,
LINE 795: Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.
LINE 796: His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,
LINE 797: On every side the busy combat grows;
LINE 798: Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode
LINE 799: (The pails high foaming with a milky flood)
LINE 800: The buzzing flies, a persevering train,
LINE 801: Incessant swarm, and chased return again.
LINE 802: Jove view'd the combat with a stern survey,
LINE 803: And eyes that flash'd intolerable day.
LINE 804: Fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates
LINE 805: The vengeance due, and meditates the fates:
LINE 806: Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call
LINE 807: The force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,
LINE 808: This instant see his short-lived trophies won,
LINE 809: And stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;
LINE 810: Or yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,
LINE 811: Augment the fame and horror of the fight.
LINE 812: To crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise
LINE 813: At length he dooms; and, that his last of days
LINE 814: Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;
LINE 815: Nor unattended see the shades below.
LINE 816: Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;
LINE 817: He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;
LINE 818: Sunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline
LINE 819: The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.
LINE 820: Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,
LINE 821: And left their monarch with the common dead:
LINE 822: Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall
LINE 823: Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.
LINE 824: (So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain
LINE 825: The prize contested, and despoil the slain.
LINE 826: The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;
LINE 827: Patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.
LINE 828: Then thus to Phœbus, in the realms above,
LINE 829: Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:
LINE 830: "Descend, my Phœbus! on the Phrygian plain,
LINE 831: And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;
LINE 832: Then bathe his body in the crystal flood,
LINE 833: With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;
LINE 834: O'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,
LINE 835: And with celestial robes adorn the dead.
LINE 836: Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath
LINE 837: To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.
LINE 838: They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;
LINE 839: His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:
LINE 840: What honour mortals after death receive,
LINE 841: Those unavailing honours we may give!"
LINE 842: [Illustration: ] SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO
LINE 843: LYCIA
LINE 844: Apollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,
LINE 845: Swift to the field precipitates his flight;
LINE 846: Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,
LINE 847: Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;
LINE 848: There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd
LINE 849: His manly members in the immortal vest;
LINE 850: And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
LINE 851: Restores his freshness, and his form renews.
LINE 852: Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,
LINE 853: Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,
LINE 854: Received Sarpedon, at the god's command,
LINE 855: And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;
LINE 856: The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,
LINE 857: Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.
LINE 858: Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,
LINE 859: With foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.
LINE 860: Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,
LINE 861: Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:
LINE 862: Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,
LINE 863: Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.
LINE 864: For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd
LINE 865: Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;
LINE 866: The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,
LINE 867: He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.
LINE 868: Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,
LINE 869: Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;
LINE 870: When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,
LINE 871: And call'd to fill the number of the dead?
LINE 872: Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;
LINE 873: Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,
LINE 874: Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;
LINE 875: The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:
LINE 876: Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;
LINE 877: The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.
LINE 878: Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,
LINE 879: But flaming Phœbus kept the sacred tower.
LINE 880: Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;[246]
LINE 881: His blazing ægis thrice Apollo shook;
LINE 882: He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,
LINE 883: A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
LINE 884: "Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall
LINE 885: Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;
LINE 886: Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,
LINE 887: Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."
LINE 888: So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;
LINE 889: The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.
LINE 890: While Hector, checking at the Scæan gates
LINE 891: His panting coursers, in his breast debates,
LINE 892: Or in the field his forces to employ,
LINE 893: Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.
LINE 894: Thus while he thought, beside him Phœbus stood,
LINE 895: In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;
LINE 896: (Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,
LINE 897: A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)
LINE 898: Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!
LINE 899: God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?
LINE 900: Were thine my vigour this successful spear
LINE 901: Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.
LINE 902: Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,
LINE 903: And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.
LINE 904: Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,
LINE 905: And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."
LINE 906: So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,
LINE 907: And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
LINE 908: He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;
LINE 909: The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.
LINE 910: The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,
LINE 911: And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.
LINE 912: Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;
LINE 913: A spear his left, a stone employs his right:
LINE 914: With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.
LINE 915: Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
LINE 916: The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,
LINE 917: The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;
LINE 918: His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:
LINE 919: The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.
LINE 920: The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,
LINE 921: Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.
LINE 922: To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,
LINE 923: While the proud victor thus his fall derides.
LINE 924: "Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
LINE 925: What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!
LINE 926: Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!
LINE 927: Pity that all their practice is by land!"
LINE 928: Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,
LINE 929: To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:
LINE 930: Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,
LINE 931: That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;
LINE 932: Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,
LINE 933: And from his fatal courage finds his bane.
LINE 934: At once bold Hector leaping from his car,
LINE 935: Defends the body, and provokes the war.
LINE 936: Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,
LINE 937: Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;
LINE 938: Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,
LINE 939: And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
LINE 940: Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,
LINE 941: And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:
LINE 942: While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,
LINE 943: Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
LINE 944: So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud
LINE 945: In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;
LINE 946: Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,
LINE 947: The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;
LINE 948: This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,
LINE 949: And the whole forest in one crash descends.
LINE 950: Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,
LINE 951: In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.
LINE 952: Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;
LINE 953: Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:
LINE 954: Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,
LINE 955: Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.
LINE 956: But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,
LINE 957: Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,
LINE 958: And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!
LINE 959: Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven
LINE 960: His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;
LINE 961: While on each host with equal tempests fell
LINE 962: The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.
LINE 963: But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,
LINE 964: Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.
LINE 965: Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,
LINE 966: They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.
LINE 967: Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,
LINE 968: And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.
LINE 969: Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,
LINE 970: And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.
LINE 971: There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine
LINE 972: The last, black remnant of so bright a line:
LINE 973: Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;
LINE 974: Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!
LINE 975: For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,
LINE 976: Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.
LINE 977: The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;
LINE 978: His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel
LINE 979: In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,
LINE 980: His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.
LINE 981: Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;
LINE 982: That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;
LINE 983: Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,
LINE 984: And shade the temples of the mad divine.
LINE 985: Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;
LINE 986: Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.
LINE 987: His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield
LINE 988: Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:
LINE 989: The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:
LINE 990: Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;
LINE 991: Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:
LINE 992: Such is the force of more than mortal hands!
LINE 993: A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,
LINE 994: From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;
LINE 995: Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,
LINE 996: Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:
LINE 997: Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,
LINE 998: While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.
LINE 999: His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;
LINE 1000: He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.
LINE 1001: Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:
LINE 1002: But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
LINE 1003: And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.
LINE 1004: Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,
LINE 1005: Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,
LINE 1006: Retires for succour to his social train,
LINE 1007: And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.
LINE 1008: Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,
LINE 1009: Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:
LINE 1010: The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;
LINE 1011: He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.
LINE 1012: With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all
LINE 1013: Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.
LINE 1014: So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,
LINE 1015: The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,
LINE 1016: Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,
LINE 1017: With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;
LINE 1018: At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;
LINE 1019: And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
LINE 1020: Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,
LINE 1021: So many lives effused, expires his own.
LINE 1022: As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,
LINE 1023: He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:
LINE 1024: "Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy
LINE 1025: Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;
LINE 1026: The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,
LINE 1027: And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.
LINE 1028: Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,
LINE 1029: And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:
LINE 1030: But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;
LINE 1031: Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;
LINE 1032: Though much at parting that great chief might say,
LINE 1033: And much enjoin thee, this important day.
LINE 1034: 'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),
LINE 1035: Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'
LINE 1036: He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped."
LINE 1037: Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,
LINE 1038: With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:
LINE 1039: "Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!
LINE 1040: Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;
LINE 1041: To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,
LINE 1042: And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.
LINE 1043: Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,
LINE 1044: Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:
LINE 1045: By fate and Phœbus was I first o'erthrown,
LINE 1046: Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.
LINE 1047: But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;
LINE 1048: The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:
LINE 1049: Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;
LINE 1050: Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;
LINE 1051: Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,
LINE 1052: I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand."
LINE 1053: He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,
LINE 1054: (The beauteous body left a load of clay)
LINE 1055: Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;
LINE 1056: A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
LINE 1057: Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed
LINE 1058: On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:
LINE 1059: "From whence this boding speech, the stern decree
LINE 1060: Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?
LINE 1061: Why not as well Achilles' fate be given
LINE 1062: To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?"
LINE 1063: Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay
LINE 1064: His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;
LINE 1065: And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear
LINE 1066: He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.
LINE 1067: But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins
LINE 1068: Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,
LINE 1069: Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;
LINE 1070: The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.
