LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.[269]
LINE 3: The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the
LINE 4: river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes
LINE 5: twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and
LINE 6: kills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves:
LINE 7: Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length
LINE 8: Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This
LINE 9: combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles
LINE 10: continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a
LINE 11: stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude
LINE 12: Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues him in
LINE 13: that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their
LINE 14: city.
LINE 15: The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream
LINE 16: of Scamander.
LINE 17: And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,
LINE 18: Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.
LINE 19: The river here divides the flying train,
LINE 20: Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,
LINE 21: Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,
LINE 22: Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:
LINE 23: (These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,
LINE 24: And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)
LINE 25: Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,
LINE 26: The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:
LINE 27: With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,
LINE 28: And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,
LINE 29: The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.
LINE 30: As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,
LINE 31: While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;
LINE 32: Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,
LINE 33: The clustering legions rush into the flood:
LINE 34: So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,
LINE 35: Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.
LINE 36: His bloody lance the hero casts aside,
LINE 37: (Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)
LINE 38: Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,
LINE 39: Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:
LINE 40: Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,
LINE 41: Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;
LINE 42: Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,
LINE 43: And the warm purple circled on the tide.
LINE 44: Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,
LINE 45: And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:
LINE 46: So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,
LINE 47: In shoals before him fly the scaly train,
LINE 48: Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,
LINE 49: Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.
LINE 50: Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band
LINE 51: Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;
LINE 52: With their rich belts their captive arms restrains
LINE 53: (Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).
LINE 54: These his attendants to the ships convey'd,
LINE 55: Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;
LINE 56: Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,
LINE 57: The young Lycaon in his passage stood;
LINE 58: The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand
LINE 59: But late made captive in his father's land
LINE 60: (As from a sycamore, his sounding steel
LINE 61: Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)
LINE 62: To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,
LINE 63: Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;
LINE 64: But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,
LINE 65: The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.
LINE 66: Ten days were past, since in his father's reign
LINE 67: He felt the sweets of liberty again;
LINE 68: The next, that god whom men in vain withstand
LINE 69: Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand
LINE 70: Now never to return! and doom'd to go
LINE 71: A sadder journey to the shades below.
LINE 72: His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,
LINE 73: (The helm and visor he had cast aside
LINE 74: With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field
LINE 75: His useless lance and unavailing shield,)
LINE 76: As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,
LINE 77: And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said:
LINE 78: "Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!
LINE 79: Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?
LINE 80: Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd
LINE 81: Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;
LINE 82: As now the captive, whom so late I bound
LINE 83: And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!
LINE 84: Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,
LINE 85: That bar such numbers from their native plain;
LINE 86: Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!
LINE 87: Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;
LINE 88: If earth, at length this active prince can seize,
LINE 89: Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."
LINE 90: Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears
LINE 91: Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears
LINE 92: Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,
LINE 93: And his soul shivering at the approach of death.
LINE 94: Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;
LINE 95: He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:
LINE 96: And while, above, the spear suspended stood,
LINE 97: Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,
LINE 98: One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,
LINE 99: While thus these melting words attempt his heart:
LINE 100: "Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,
LINE 101: Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.
LINE 102: Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,
LINE 103: Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;
LINE 104: Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,
LINE 105: Far from his father, friends, and native shore;
LINE 106: A hundred oxen were his price that day,
LINE 107: Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.
LINE 108: Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,
LINE 109: And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;
LINE 110: Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,
LINE 111: Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!
LINE 112: I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,
LINE 113: (Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;
LINE 114: Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,
LINE 115: And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,)
LINE 116: Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;
LINE 117: For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,
LINE 118: And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.
LINE 119: How from that arm of terror shall I fly?
LINE 120: Some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!
LINE 121: If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,
LINE 122: Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!
LINE 123: Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,
LINE 124: With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death."
LINE 125: These words, attended with a shower of tears,
LINE 126: The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:
LINE 127: "Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):
LINE 128: Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:
LINE 129: In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;
LINE 130: But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.
LINE 131: Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?
LINE 132: The great, the good Patroclus is no more!
LINE 133: He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,
LINE 134: And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?
LINE 135: Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,
LINE 136: Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?
LINE 137: The day shall come (which nothing can avert)
LINE 138: When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,
LINE 139: By night, or day, by force, or by design,
LINE 140: Impending death and certain fate are mine!
LINE 141: Die then,"â€”He said; and as the word he spoke,
LINE 142: The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:
LINE 143: His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,
LINE 144: While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:
LINE 145: Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,
LINE 146: And buried in his neck the reeking blade.
LINE 147: Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,
LINE 148: The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.
LINE 149: The victor to the stream the carcase gave,
LINE 150: And thus insults him, floating on the wave:
LINE 151: "Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround
LINE 152: Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:
LINE 153: There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,
LINE 154: But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,
LINE 155: Whose every wave some watery monster brings,
LINE 156: To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.
LINE 157: So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!
LINE 158: Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.
LINE 159: What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,
LINE 160: His earthly honours, and immortal name?
LINE 161: In vain your immolated bulls are slain,
LINE 162: Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!
LINE 163: Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;
LINE 164: Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:
LINE 165: Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,
LINE 166: And the short absence of Achilles paid."
LINE 167: These boastful words provoked the raging god;
LINE 168: With fury swells the violated flood.
LINE 169: What means divine may yet the power employ
LINE 170: To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?
LINE 171: Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare
LINE 172: The great Asteropeus to mortal war;
LINE 173: The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line
LINE 174: Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!
LINE 175: (Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd,
LINE 176: With all his refluent waters circled round:)
LINE 177: On him Achilles rush'd; he fearless stood,
LINE 178: And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;
LINE 179: The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head
LINE 180: To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.
LINE 181: Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:
LINE 182: "What art thou, boldest of the race of man?
LINE 183: Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire
LINE 184: Whose son encounters our resistless ire."
LINE 185: "O son of Peleus! what avails to trace
LINE 186: (Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?
LINE 187: From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,
LINE 188: Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;
LINE 189: Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came
LINE 190: In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:
LINE 191: Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,
LINE 192: And wide around the floated region fills,
LINE 193: Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:
LINE 194: Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!"
LINE 195: Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;
LINE 196: At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,
LINE 197: (For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)
LINE 198: One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;
LINE 199: One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood
LINE 200: Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.
LINE 201: Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:
LINE 202: Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;
LINE 203: Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,
LINE 204: Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.
LINE 205: Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,
LINE 206: And on his foe with double fury flew.
LINE 207: The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;
LINE 208: Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:
LINE 209: The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;
LINE 210: Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;
LINE 211: His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,
LINE 212: The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.
LINE 213: Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,
LINE 214: And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;
LINE 215: While the proud victor thus triumphing said,
LINE 216: His radiant armour tearing from the dead:
LINE 217: "So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,
LINE 218: Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!
LINE 219: Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?
LINE 220: But great Saturnius is the source of mine.
LINE 221: How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?
LINE 222: Of Peleus, Ã†acus, and Jove, am I.
LINE 223: The race of these superior far to those,
LINE 224: As he that thunders to the stream that flows.
LINE 225: What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;
LINE 226: But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.
LINE 227: Even Achelous might contend in vain,
LINE 228: And all the roaring billows of the main.
LINE 229: The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow
LINE 230: The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,
LINE 231: The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,
LINE 232: And in his deep abysses shakes with fear."
LINE 233: He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,
LINE 234: And left the breathless warrior in his gore.
LINE 235: The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,
LINE 236: And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;
LINE 237: Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food
LINE 238: Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.
LINE 239: All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)
LINE 240: The amazed PÃ¦onians scour along the plain;
LINE 241: He vents his fury on the flying crew,
LINE 242: Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;
LINE 243: Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ã†nius, fell;
LINE 244: And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,
LINE 245: But from the bottom of his gulfs profound
LINE 246: Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.
LINE 247: "O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)
LINE 248: In valour matchless, and in force divine!
LINE 249: If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,
LINE 250: 'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.
LINE 251: See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,
LINE 252: Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.
LINE 253: Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;
LINE 254: Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god."
LINE 255: In human form, confess'd before his eyes,
LINE 256: The river thus; and thus the chief replies:
LINE 257: "O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;
LINE 258: But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,
LINE 259: Not till within her towers the perjured train
LINE 260: Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;
LINE 261: Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,
LINE 262: Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall."
LINE 263: He said; and drove with fury on the foe.
LINE 264: Then to the godhead of the silver bow
LINE 265: The yellow flood began: "O son of Jove!
LINE 266: Was not the mandate of the sire above
LINE 267: Full and express, that PhÅ“bus should employ
LINE 268: His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,
LINE 269: And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall
LINE 270: In awful darkness hide the face of all?"
LINE 271: He spoke in vainâ€”The chief without dismay
LINE 272: Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.
LINE 273: Then rising in his rage above the shores,
LINE 274: From all his deep the bellowing river roars,
LINE 275: Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,
LINE 276: And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.
LINE 277: While all before, the billows ranged on high,
LINE 278: (A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.
LINE 279: Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,
LINE 280: The falling deluge whelms the hero round:
LINE 281: His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;
LINE 282: His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,
LINE 283: Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood
LINE 284: A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;
LINE 285: He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;
LINE 286: The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.[270]
LINE 287: Heaving the bank, and undermining all;
LINE 288: Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
LINE 289: Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd
LINE 290: Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd
LINE 291: On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,
LINE 292: Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.
LINE 293: Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:
LINE 294: The god pursues, a huger billow throws,
LINE 295: And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy
LINE 296: The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.
LINE 297: He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
LINE 298: (Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);
LINE 299: Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;
LINE 300: At every bound his clanging armour rings:
LINE 301: Now here, now there, he turns on every side,
LINE 302: And winds his course before the following tide;
LINE 303: The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,
LINE 304: And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.
LINE 305: So when a peasant to his garden brings
LINE 306: Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,
LINE 307: And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,
LINE 308: And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:
LINE 309: Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,
LINE 310: And marks the future current with his spade,
LINE 311: Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,
LINE 312: Louder and louder purl the falling rills;
LINE 313: Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,
LINE 314: And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.
LINE 315: Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes
LINE 316: Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:
LINE 317: Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;
LINE 318: The first of men, but not a match for gods.
LINE 319: Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,
LINE 320: And bravely try if all the powers were foes;
LINE 321: So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,
LINE 322: Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.
LINE 323: Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,
LINE 324: And still indignant bounds above the waves.
LINE 325: Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;
LINE 326: Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;
LINE 327: When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)
LINE 328: Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:
LINE 329: "Is there no god Achilles to befriend,
LINE 330: No power to avert his miserable end?
LINE 331: Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,[271]
LINE 332: And make my future life the sport of fate.
LINE 333: Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,
LINE 334: But most of Thetis must her son complain;
LINE 335: By PhÅ“bus' darts she prophesied my fall,
LINE 336: In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.
LINE 337: Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,
LINE 338: Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!
LINE 339: Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,
LINE 340: And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.
LINE 341: Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,
LINE 342: Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!
LINE 343: Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,
LINE 344: Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,
LINE 345: An unregarded carcase to the sea."
LINE 346: Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,
LINE 347: And thus in human form address'd the chief:
LINE 348: The power of ocean first: "Forbear thy fear,
LINE 349: O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!
LINE 350: Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,
LINE 351: Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.
LINE 352: Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave
LINE 353: 'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.
LINE 354: But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!
LINE 355: Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,
LINE 356: Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all
LINE 357: Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:
LINE 358: Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,
LINE 359: And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
LINE 360: Thine is the glory doom'd." Thus spake the gods:
LINE 361: Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.
LINE 362: Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,
LINE 363: He springs impetuous, and invades the field:
LINE 364: O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;
LINE 365: Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,
LINE 366: Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold
LINE 367: And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.
LINE 368: High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,
LINE 369: He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.
LINE 370: Not a whole river stops the hero's course,
LINE 371: While Pallas fills him with immortal force.
LINE 372: With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,
LINE 373: And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.
LINE 374: Then thus to Simois! "Haste, my brother flood;
LINE 375: And check this mortal that controls a god;
LINE 376: Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,
LINE 377: And Ilion tumble from her towery height.
LINE 378: Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,
LINE 379: From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,
LINE 380: With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,
LINE 381: Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.
LINE 382: Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,
LINE 383: And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!
LINE 384: But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,
LINE 385: Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:
LINE 386: Whelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,
LINE 387: That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;
LINE 388: And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,
LINE 389: Immersed remain this terror of the world.
LINE 390: Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,
LINE 391: No Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,
LINE 392: No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;
LINE 393: These his cold rites, and this his watery tomb."
LINE 394: [Illustration: ] ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS
LINE 395: He said; and on the chief descends amain,
LINE 396: Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.
LINE 397: Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,
LINE 398: And a foam whitens on the purple waves:
LINE 399: At every step, before Achilles stood
LINE 400: The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.
LINE 401: Fear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,
LINE 402: She call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.
LINE 403: "Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires
LINE 404: Thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!
LINE 405: While to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,
LINE 406: Rush the swift eastern and the western wind:
LINE 407: These from old ocean at my word shall blow,
LINE 408: Pour the red torrent on the watery foe,
LINE 409: Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,
LINE 410: And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.
LINE 411: Go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,
LINE 412: Drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.
LINE 413: Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)
LINE 414: Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!"
LINE 415: The power ignipotent her word obeys:
LINE 416: Wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;
LINE 417: At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil
LINE 418: And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.
LINE 419: As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,
LINE 420: And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:
LINE 421: So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,
LINE 422: While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.
LINE 423: Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;
LINE 424: Along the margin winds the running blaze:
LINE 425: The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,
LINE 426: The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,
LINE 427: Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;
LINE 428: The watery willows hiss before the fire.
LINE 429: Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,
LINE 430: The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:
LINE 431: Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,
LINE 432: Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.
LINE 433: At length the river rear'd his languid head,
LINE 434: And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:
LINE 435: "Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?
LINE 436: I faint, I sink, unequal to the fightâ€”
LINE 437: I yieldâ€”Let Ilion fall; if fate decreeâ€”
LINE 438: Ahâ€”bend no more thy fiery arms on me!"
LINE 439: He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;
LINE 440: The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.
LINE 441: As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,[272]
LINE 442: To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,
LINE 443: Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
LINE 444: The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:
LINE 445: So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,
LINE 446: And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.
LINE 447: To Juno then, imperial queen of air,
LINE 448: The burning river sends his earnest prayer:
LINE 449: "Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage
LINE 450: Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?
LINE 451: On other gods his dreadful arm employ,
LINE 452: For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.
LINE 453: Submissive I desist, if thou command;
LINE 454: But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.
LINE 455: Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate
LINE 456: Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,
LINE 457: Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,
LINE 458: And in one ruin sink the Trojan name."
LINE 459: His warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:
LINE 460: She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,
LINE 461: Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause
LINE 462: Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:
LINE 463: Again the branching streams begin to spread,
LINE 464: And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.
LINE 465: While these by Juno's will the strife resign,
LINE 466: The warring gods in fierce contention join:
LINE 467: Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:
LINE 468: With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:
LINE 469: Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;
LINE 470: And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.
LINE 471: Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,
LINE 472: And views contending gods with careless eyes.
LINE 473: The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,
LINE 474: And first assaults the radiant queen of war:
LINE 475: "What moved thy madness, thus to disunite
LINE 476: Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?
LINE 477: What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood
LINE 478: Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?
LINE 479: Thy impious hand Tydides' javelin bore,
LINE 480: And madly bathed it in celestial gore."
LINE 481: He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,
LINE 482: Which bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful field:
LINE 483: The adamantine Ã¦gis of her sire,
LINE 484: That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.
LINE 485: Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand
LINE 486: A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,
LINE 487: There fix'd from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;
LINE 488: This at the heavenly homicide she cast.
LINE 489: Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:
LINE 490: And seven broad acres covers as he lies.
LINE 491: The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:
LINE 492: Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:
LINE 493: The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,
LINE 494: And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:
LINE 495: "Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known
LINE 496: How far Minerva's force transcends thy own?
LINE 497: Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,
LINE 498: Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas' hand;
LINE 499: Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,
LINE 500: And partial aid to Troy's perfidious race."
LINE 501: The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,
LINE 502: That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.
LINE 503: Jove's Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,
LINE 504: Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:
LINE 505: Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,
LINE 506: And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.
LINE 507: This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,
LINE 508: And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:
LINE 509: "Lo! what an aid on Mars's side is seen!
LINE 510: The smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!
LINE 511: Mark with what insolence, in open view,
LINE 512: She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue."
LINE 513: Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,
LINE 514: And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:
LINE 515: She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);
LINE 516: On earth together lay the lovers spread.
LINE 517: "And like these heroes be the fate of all
LINE 518: (Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!
LINE 519: To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,
LINE 520: So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;
LINE 521: Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved."
LINE 522: Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.
LINE 523: Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,
LINE 524: The god of ocean dares the god of light.
LINE 525: "What sloth has seized us, when the fields around
LINE 526: Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:
LINE 527: Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,
LINE 528: No deed perform'd, to our Olympian sire?
LINE 529: Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,
LINE 530: Suits not my greatness, or superior age:
LINE 531: Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,
LINE 532: (Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)
LINE 533: And guard the race of proud Laomedon!
LINE 534: Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,
LINE 535: We shared the lengthen'd labours of a year?
LINE 536: Troy walls I raised (for such were Jove's commands),
LINE 537: And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:
LINE 538: Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves
LINE 539: Along fair Ida's vales and pendant groves.
LINE 540: But when the circling seasons in their train
LINE 541: Brought back the grateful day that crown'd our pain,
LINE 542: With menace stern the fraudful king defied
LINE 543: Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:
LINE 544: Mad as he was, he threaten'd servile bands,
LINE 545: And doom'd us exiles far in barbarous lands.[273]
LINE 546: Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,
LINE 547: And destined vengeance on the perjured king.
LINE 548: Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,
LINE 549: And not, like us, infest the faithless race;
LINE 550: Like us, their present, future sons destroy,
LINE 551: And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?"
LINE 552: Apollo thus: "To combat for mankind
LINE 553: Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;
LINE 554: For what is man? Calamitous by birth,
LINE 555: They owe their life and nourishment to earth;
LINE 556: Like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown'd,
LINE 557: Smile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.
LINE 558: To their own hands commit the frantic scene,
LINE 559: Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean."
LINE 560: Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,
LINE 561: And from the senior power submiss retires:
LINE 562: Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,
LINE 563: The quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades:
LINE 564: "And is it thus the youthful PhÅ“bus flies,
LINE 565: And yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?
LINE 566: How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show
LINE 567: Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!
LINE 568: Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,
LINE 569: Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power."
LINE 570: Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:
LINE 571: Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:
LINE 572: But furious thus: "What insolence has driven
LINE 573: Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?
LINE 574: What though by Jove the female plague design'd,
LINE 575: Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,
LINE 576: The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;
LINE 577: Thy sex's tyrant, with a tiger's heart?
LINE 578: What though tremendous in the woodland chase
LINE 579: Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?
LINE 580: How dares thy rashness on the powers divine
LINE 581: Employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?
LINE 582: Learn hence, no more unequal war to wageâ€”"
LINE 583: She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;
LINE 584: These in her left hand lock'd, her right untied
LINE 585: The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.
LINE 586: About her temples flies the busy bow;
LINE 587: Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;
LINE 588: The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,
LINE 589: Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.
LINE 590: Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,
LINE 591: And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:
LINE 592: So, when the falcon wings her way above,
LINE 593: To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;
LINE 594: (Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,
LINE 595: Yet still her heart against the marble beats.
LINE 596: To her Latona hastes with tender care;
LINE 597: Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:
LINE 598: "How shall I face the dame, who gives delight
LINE 599: To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?
LINE 600: Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,
LINE 601: And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize."
LINE 602: He spoke; and pass'd: Latona, stooping low,
LINE 603: Collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,
LINE 604: That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there
LINE 605: Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war:
LINE 606: Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,
LINE 607: Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;
LINE 608: Weeping, she grasp'd his knees: the ambrosial vest
LINE 609: Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.
LINE 610: The sire superior smiled, and bade her show
LINE 611: What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?
LINE 612: Abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse;
LINE 613: And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.
LINE 614: Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,
LINE 615: Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town;
LINE 616: The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,
LINE 617: And fear'd the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.
LINE 618: Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms,
LINE 619: Return the shining bands of gods in arms;
LINE 620: Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;
LINE 621: And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.
LINE 622: Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,
LINE 623: O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.
LINE 624: As when avenging flames with fury driven
LINE 625: On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;
LINE 626: The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;
LINE 627: And the red vapours purple all the sky:
LINE 628: So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,
LINE 629: And toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.
LINE 630: High on a turret hoary Priam stands,
LINE 631: And marks the waste of his destructive hands;
LINE 632: Views, from his arm, the Trojans' scatter'd flight,
LINE 633: And the near hero rising on his sight!
LINE 634: No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,
LINE 635: And settled sorrow on his aged face,
LINE 636: Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;
LINE 637: And thus descending, on the guards he calls:
LINE 638: "You to whose care our city-gates belong,
LINE 639: Set wide your portals to the flying throng:
LINE 640: For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;
LINE 641: He comes, and desolation marks his way!
LINE 642: But when within the walls our troops take breath,
LINE 643: Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death."
LINE 644: Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung
LINE 645: The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.
LINE 646: PhÅ“bus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;
LINE 647: Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,
LINE 648: On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,
LINE 649: And gladsome see their last escape from fate.
LINE 650: Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,
LINE 651: Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:
LINE 652: And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
LINE 653: With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.
LINE 654: Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;
LINE 655: Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.
LINE 656: Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,
LINE 657: And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;
LINE 658: But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,
LINE 659: Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:
LINE 660: To young Agenor force divine he gave;
LINE 661: (Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)
LINE 662: In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,
LINE 663: And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.
LINE 664: When now the generous youth Achilles spies,
LINE 665: Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.
LINE 666: (So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)
LINE 667: He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;
LINE 668: "What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!
LINE 669: Like others fly, and be like others slain?
LINE 670: Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road
LINE 671: Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.
LINE 672: No: with the common heap I scorn to fallâ€”
LINE 673: What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,
LINE 674: While I decline to yonder path, that leads
LINE 675: To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?
LINE 676: So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,
LINE 677: From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,
LINE 678: As soon as night her dusky veil extends,
LINE 679: Return in safety to my Trojan friends.
LINE 680: What if?â€”But wherefore all this vain debate?
LINE 681: Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?
LINE 682: Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,
LINE 683: The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:
LINE 684: Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,
LINE 685: And such his valour, that who stands must die.
LINE 686: Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,
LINE 687: Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.
LINE 688: Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel
LINE 689: (Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.
LINE 690: One only soul informs that dreadful frame:
LINE 691: And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame."
LINE 692: He said, and stood, collected, in his might;
LINE 693: And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.
LINE 694: So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,
LINE 695: Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:
LINE 696: Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds
LINE 697: Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;
LINE 698: Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;
LINE 699: And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:
LINE 700: On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;
LINE 701: And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.
LINE 702: Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir
LINE 703: Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,
LINE 704: Disdainful of retreat: high held before,
LINE 705: His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;
LINE 706: Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw
LINE 707: The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:
LINE 708: "How proud Achilles glories in his fame!
LINE 709: And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name
LINE 710: Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;
LINE 711: A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.
LINE 712: Parents and children our just arms employ,
LINE 713: And strong and many are the sons of Troy.
LINE 714: Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore
LINE 715: These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore."
LINE 716: He said: with matchless force the javelin flung
LINE 717: Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung
LINE 718: Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms
LINE 719: He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.
LINE 720: Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,
LINE 721: His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:
LINE 722: But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds
LINE 723: The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.
LINE 724: Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,
LINE 725: Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.
LINE 726: Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,
LINE 727: Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,
LINE 728: Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;
LINE 729: The furious chief still follows where he flies.
LINE 730: Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,
LINE 731: Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:
LINE 732: The god, now distant scarce a stride before,
LINE 733: Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;
LINE 734: While all the flying troops their speed employ,
LINE 735: And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:
LINE 736: No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,
LINE 737: Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.
LINE 738: 'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;
LINE 739: And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.
LINE 740: Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:
LINE 741: And nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.
