LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.
LINE 3: The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by
LINE 4: Antilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-
LINE 5: nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this
LINE 6: occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders
LINE 7: him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him
LINE 8: turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off
LINE 9: by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas
LINE 10: disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to
LINE 11: remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of
LINE 12: Patroclus.
LINE 13: Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son.
LINE 14: The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that
LINE 15: noble one of the shield of Achilles.
LINE 16: The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night
LINE 17: ensuing, take up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the
LINE 18: sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.
LINE 19: Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,[250]
LINE 20: And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
LINE 21: Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,
LINE 22: Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:
LINE 23: There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,
LINE 24: On hoisted yards extended to the gales;
LINE 25: Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd
LINE 26: Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.
LINE 27: Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains
LINE 28: The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?
LINE 29: Is this the day, which heaven so long ago
LINE 30: Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?
LINE 31: (So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand
LINE 32: The bravest of the Myrmidonian band
LINE 33: Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;
LINE 34: Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!
LINE 35: In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,
LINE 36: And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!"
LINE 37: Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,
LINE 38: And tells the melancholy tale with tears.
LINE 39: "Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;
LINE 40: And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!
LINE 41: Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;
LINE 42: His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right."
LINE 43: A sudden horror shot through all the chief,
LINE 44: And wrapp'd his senses in the cloud of grief;
LINE 45: Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread
LINE 46: The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head;
LINE 47: His purple garments, and his golden hairs,
LINE 48: Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;
LINE 49: On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,
LINE 50: And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.
LINE 51: The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,
LINE 52: (Won by his own, or by Patroclus' arms,)
LINE 53: Rush'd from their tents with cries; and gathering round,
LINE 54: Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:
LINE 55: While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part,
LINE 56: And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart;
LINE 57: Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,
LINE 58: And oft prevents the meditated blow.
LINE 59: Far in the deep abysses of the main,[251]
LINE 60: With hoary Nereus, and the watery train,
LINE 61: The mother-goddess from her crystal throne
LINE 62: Heard his loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.
LINE 63: The circling Nereids with their mistress weep,
LINE 64: And all the sea-green sisters of the deep.
LINE 65: Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),
LINE 66: Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:
LINE 67: Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,
LINE 68: And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.
LINE 69: Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,
LINE 70: Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear,
LINE 71: Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita;
LINE 72: Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:
LINE 73: Next Callianira, Callianassa show
LINE 74: Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow,
LINE 75: And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides:
LINE 76: Iaera now the verdant wave divides:
LINE 77: Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head,
LINE 78: Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed;
LINE 79: These Orythia, Clymene, attend,
LINE 80: Maera, Amphinome, the train extend;
LINE 81: And black Janira, and Janassa fair,
LINE 82: And Amatheia with her amber hair.
LINE 83: All these, and all that deep in ocean held
LINE 84: Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd;
LINE 85: Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,
LINE 86: Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow:
LINE 87: "Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!
LINE 88: How just a cause has Thetis to complain!
LINE 89: How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!
LINE 90: How more than wretched in the immortal state!
LINE 91: Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,
LINE 92: The bravest far that ever bore the name;
LINE 93: Like some fair olive, by my careful hand
LINE 94: He grew, he flourish'd and adorn'd the land!
LINE 95: To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain
LINE 96: He never, never must return again.
LINE 97: So short a space the light of heaven to view,
LINE 98: So short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!
LINE 99: Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!
LINE 100: I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;
LINE 101: I go at least to bear a tender part,
LINE 102: And mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart."
LINE 103: She said, and left the caverns of the main,
LINE 104: All bathed in tears; the melancholy train
LINE 105: Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,
LINE 106: While the long pomp the silver wave divides.
LINE 107: Approaching now, they touch'd the Trojan land;
LINE 108: Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.
LINE 109: The immortal mother, standing close beside
LINE 110: Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;
LINE 111: Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,
LINE 112: And thus the silver-footed dame began:
LINE 113: "Why mourns my son? thy late preferr'd request
LINE 114: The god has granted, and the Greeks distress'd:
LINE 115: Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,
LINE 116: Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."
LINE 117: He, deeply groaning—"To this cureless grief,
LINE 118: Not even the Thunderer's favour brings relief.
LINE 119: Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast
LINE 120: A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;
LINE 121: Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,
LINE 122: Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!
LINE 123: Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow'd
LINE 124: On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.
LINE 125: Cursed be that day, when all the powers above
LINE 126: Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:
LINE 127: O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,
LINE 128: Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:
LINE 129: And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led
LINE 130: A mortal beauty to his equal bed!
LINE 131: Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb
LINE 132: Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.
LINE 133: For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,
LINE 134: New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.
LINE 135: 'Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;
LINE 136: Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.
LINE 137: Let me revenge it on proud Hector's heart,
LINE 138: Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;
LINE 139: On these conditions will I breathe: till then,
LINE 140: I blush to walk among the race of men."
LINE 141: A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:
LINE 142: "Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!
LINE 143: When Hector falls, thou diest."—"Let Hector die,
LINE 144: And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)
LINE 145: Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!
LINE 146: He fell, and falling, wish'd my aid in vain.
LINE 147: Ah then, since from this miserable day
LINE 148: I cast all hope of my return away;
LINE 149: Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand
LINE 150: The fate of Hector from Achilles' hand;
LINE 151: Since here, for brutal courage far renown'd,
LINE 152: I live an idle burden to the ground,
LINE 153: (Others in council famed for nobler skill,
LINE 154: More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)
LINE 155: Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above!
LINE 156: Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:
LINE 157: Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,
LINE 158: Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:
LINE 159: Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind
LINE 160: From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.
LINE 161: Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;
LINE 162: 'Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate.
LINE 163: Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;
LINE 164: Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.
LINE 165: The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:
LINE 166: The great Alcides, Jove's unequall'd son,
LINE 167: To Juno's hate, at length resign'd his breath,
LINE 168: And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.
LINE 169: So shall Achilles fall! stretch'd pale and dead,
LINE 170: No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!
LINE 171: Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,
LINE 172: And reap what glory life's short harvest yields.
LINE 173: Shall I not force some widow'd dame to tear
LINE 174: With frantic hands her long dishevell'd hair?
LINE 175: Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,
LINE 176: And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?
LINE 177: Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms—
LINE 178: In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—
LINE 179: Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,
LINE 180: That all shall know Achilles swells the tide."
LINE 181: "My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,
LINE 182: To fate submitting with a secret sigh,)
LINE 183: The host to succour, and thy friends to save,
LINE 184: Is worthy thee; the duty of the brave.
LINE 185: But canst thou, naked, issue to the plains?
LINE 186: Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains.
LINE 187: Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high,
LINE 188: But vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.
LINE 189: Yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;
LINE 190: Assured, I meet thee at the dawn of day,
LINE 191: Charged with refulgent arms (a glorious load),
LINE 192: Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god."
LINE 193: Then turning to the daughters of the main,
LINE 194: The goddess thus dismiss'd her azure train:
LINE 195: "Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend;
LINE 196: Haste, and our father's sacred seat attend;
LINE 197: I go to find the architect divine,
LINE 198: Where vast Olympus' starry summits shine:
LINE 199: So tell our hoary sire"—This charge she gave:
LINE 200: The sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave:
LINE 201: Thetis once more ascends the bless'd abodes,
LINE 202: And treads the brazen threshold of the gods.
LINE 203: [Illustration: ] THETIS ORDERING THE NEREIDS TO DESCEND INTO THE SEA
LINE 204: And now the Greeks from furious Hector's force,
LINE 205: Urge to broad Hellespont their headlong course;
LINE 206: Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus' body bore
LINE 207: Safe through the tempest to the tented shore.
LINE 208: The horse, the foot, with equal fury join'd,
LINE 209: Pour'd on the rear, and thunder'd close behind:
LINE 210: And like a flame through fields of ripen'd corn,
LINE 211: The rage of Hector o'er the ranks was borne.
LINE 212: Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew;
LINE 213: Thrice to the skies the Trojan clamours flew:
LINE 214: As oft the Ajaces his assault sustain;
LINE 215: But check'd, he turns; repuls'd, attacks again.
LINE 216: With fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires,
LINE 217: Nor yields a step, nor from his post retires:
LINE 218: So watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain,
LINE 219: The hungry lion from a carcase slain.
LINE 220: Even yet Patroclus had he borne away,
LINE 221: And all the glories of the extended day,
LINE 222: Had not high Juno from the realms of air,
LINE 223: Secret, despatch'd her trusty messenger.
LINE 224: The various goddess of the showery bow,
LINE 225: Shot in a whirlwind to the shore below;
LINE 226: To great Achilles at his ships she came,
LINE 227: And thus began the many-colour'd dame:
LINE 228: "Rise, son of Peleus! rise, divinely brave!
LINE 229: Assist the combat, and Patroclus save:
LINE 230: For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread,
LINE 231: And fall by mutual wounds around the dead.
LINE 232: To drag him back to Troy the foe contends:
LINE 233: Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends:
LINE 234: A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,
LINE 235: And marks the place to fix his head on high.
LINE 236: Rise, and prevent (if yet you think of fame)
LINE 237: Thy friend's disgrace, thy own eternal shame!"
LINE 238: "Who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?"
LINE 239: Achilles thus. And Iris thus replies:
LINE 240: "I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove,
LINE 241: The immortal empress of the realms above;
LINE 242: Unknown to him who sits remote on high,
LINE 243: Unknown to all the synod of the sky."
LINE 244: "Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm'd);
LINE 245: Arms I have none, and can I fight unarm'd?
LINE 246: Unwilling as I am, of force I stay,
LINE 247: Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day
LINE 248: Vulcanian arms: what other can I wield,
LINE 249: Except the mighty Telamonian shield?
LINE 250: That, in my friend's defence, has Ajax spread,
LINE 251: While his strong lance around him heaps the dead:
LINE 252: The gallant chief defends Menoetius' son,
LINE 253: And does what his Achilles should have done."
LINE 254: "Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;
LINE 255: But though unarm'd, yet clad in terrors, go!
LINE 256: Let but Achilles o'er yon trench appear,
LINE 257: Proud Troy shall tremble, and consent to fear;
LINE 258: Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye
LINE 259: Shall take new courage, and disdain to fly."
LINE 260: She spoke, and pass'd in air. The hero rose:
LINE 261: Her ægis Pallas o'er his shoulder throws;
LINE 262: Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;
LINE 263: A stream of glory flamed above his head.
LINE 264: As when from some beleaguer'd town arise
LINE 265: The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies;
LINE 266: (Seen from some island, o'er the main afar,
LINE 267: When men distress'd hang out the sign of war;)
LINE 268: Soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays,
LINE 269: Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze;
LINE 270: With long-projected beams the seas are bright,
LINE 271: And heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light:
LINE 272: So from Achilles' head the splendours rise,
LINE 273: Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.
LINE 274: Forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd,
LINE 275: High on the rampart raised his voice aloud;
LINE 276: With her own shout Minerva swells the sound;
LINE 277: Troy starts astonish'd, and the shores rebound.
LINE 278: As the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far
LINE 279: With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,
LINE 280: Struck from the walls, the echoes float on high,
LINE 281: And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply;
LINE 282: So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd:
LINE 283: Hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard:
LINE 284: And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,
LINE 285: And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.
LINE 286: Aghast they see the living lightnings play,
LINE 287: And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.
LINE 288: Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,
LINE 289: And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.
LINE 290: Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush'd
LINE 291: On their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd:
LINE 292: While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain
LINE 293: The long-contended carcase of the slain.
LINE 294: A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears:
LINE 295: Around, his sad companions melt in tears.
LINE 296: But chief Achilles, bending down his head,
LINE 297: Pours unavailing sorrows o'er the dead,
LINE 298: Whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,
LINE 299: He sent refulgent to the field of war;
LINE 300: (Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found,
LINE 301: Stretch'd forth, and gash'd with many a gaping wound.
LINE 302: Meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,
LINE 303: In ocean's waves the unwilling light of day
LINE 304: Quench'd his red orb, at Juno's high command,
LINE 305: And from their labours eased the Achaian band.
LINE 306: The frighted Trojans (panting from the war,
LINE 307: Their steeds unharness'd from the weary car)
LINE 308: A sudden council call'd: each chief appear'd
LINE 309: In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear'd.
LINE 310: 'Twas now no season for prolong'd debate;
LINE 311: They saw Achilles, and in him their fate.
LINE 312: Silent they stood: Polydamas at last,
LINE 313: Skill'd to discern the future by the past,
LINE 314: The son of Panthus, thus express'd his fears
LINE 315: (The friend of Hector, and of equal years;
LINE 316: The self-same night to both a being gave,
LINE 317: One wise in council, one in action brave):
LINE 318: [Illustration: ] JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET
LINE 319: "In free debate, my friends, your sentence speak;
LINE 320: For me, I move, before the morning break,
LINE 321: To raise our camp: too dangerous here our post,
LINE 322: Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast.
LINE 323: I deem'd not Greece so dreadful, while engaged
LINE 324: In mutual feuds her king and hero raged;
LINE 325: Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail
LINE 326: We boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.
LINE 327: I dread Pelides now: his rage of mind
LINE 328: Not long continues to the shores confined,
LINE 329: Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray
LINE 330: Contending nations won and lost the day;
LINE 331: For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife,
LINE 332: And the hard contest not for fame, but life.
LINE 333: Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night
LINE 334: Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.
LINE 335: If but the morrow's sun behold us here,
LINE 336: That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;
LINE 337: And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,
LINE 338: If heaven permit them then to enter Troy.
LINE 339: Let not my fatal prophecy be true,
LINE 340: Nor what I tremble but to think, ensue.
LINE 341: Whatever be our fate, yet let us try
LINE 342: What force of thought and reason can supply;
LINE 343: Let us on counsel for our guard depend;
LINE 344: The town her gates and bulwarks shall defend.
LINE 345: When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,
LINE 346: Array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.
LINE 347: Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,
LINE 348: Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,
LINE 349: Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain,
LINE 350: Till his spent coursers seek the fleet again:
LINE 351: So may his rage be tired, and labour'd down!
LINE 352: And dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town."
LINE 353: "Return! (said Hector, fired with stern disdain)
LINE 354: What! coop whole armies in our walls again?
LINE 355: Was't not enough, ye valiant warriors, say,
LINE 356: Nine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?
LINE 357: Wide o'er the world was Ilion famed of old
LINE 358: For brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold:
LINE 359: But while inglorious in her walls we stay'd,
LINE 360: Sunk were her treasures, and her stores decay'd;
LINE 361: The Phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,
LINE 362: And proud Mæonia wastes the fruits of Troy.
LINE 363: Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls,
LINE 364: And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls,
LINE 365: Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?
LINE 366: Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight.
LINE 367: To better counsel then attention lend;
LINE 368: Take due refreshment, and the watch attend.
LINE 369: If there be one whose riches cost him care,
LINE 370: Forth let him bring them for the troops to share;
LINE 371: 'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,
LINE 372: Than left the plunder of our country's foes.
LINE 373: Soon as the morn the purple orient warms,
LINE 374: Fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.
LINE 375: If great Achilles rise in all his might,
LINE 376: His be the danger: I shall stand the fight.
LINE 377: Honour, ye gods! or let me gain or give;
LINE 378: And live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!
LINE 379: Mars is our common lord, alike to all;
LINE 380: And oft the victor triumphs, but to fall."
LINE 381: The shouting host in loud applauses join'd;
LINE 382: So Pallas robb'd the many of their mind;
LINE 383: To their own sense condemn'd, and left to choose
LINE 384: The worst advice, the better to refuse.
LINE 385: While the long night extends her sable reign,
LINE 386: Around Patroclus mourn'd the Grecian train.
LINE 387: Stern in superior grief Pelides stood;
LINE 388: Those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood,
LINE 389: Now clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing start
LINE 390: The tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart.
LINE 391: The lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,
LINE 392: Roars through the desert, and demands his young;
LINE 393: When the grim savage, to his rifled den
LINE 394: Too late returning, snuffs the track of men,
LINE 395: And o'er the vales and o'er the forest bounds;
LINE 396: His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.
LINE 397: So grieves Achilles; and, impetuous, vents
LINE 398: To all his Myrmidons his loud laments.
LINE 399: "In what vain promise, gods! did I engage,
LINE 400: When to console Menoetius' feeble age,
LINE 401: I vowed his much-loved offspring to restore,
LINE 402: Charged with rich spoils, to fair Opuntia's shore?[252]
LINE 403: But mighty Jove cuts short, with just disdain,
LINE 404: The long, long views of poor designing man!
LINE 405: One fate the warrior and the friend shall strike,
LINE 406: And Troy's black sands must drink our blood alike:
LINE 407: Me too a wretched mother shall deplore,
LINE 408: An aged father never see me more!
LINE 409: Yet, my Patroclus! yet a space I stay,
LINE 410: Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way.
LINE 411: Ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid,
LINE 412: Shall Hector's head be offer'd to thy shade;
LINE 413: That, with his arms, shall hang before thy shrine;
LINE 414: And twelve, the noblest of the Trojan line,
LINE 415: Sacred to vengeance, by this hand expire;
LINE 416: Their lives effused around thy flaming pyre.
LINE 417: Thus let me lie till then! thus, closely press'd,
LINE 418: Bathe thy cold face, and sob upon thy breast!
LINE 419: While Trojan captives here thy mourners stay,
LINE 420: Weep all the night and murmur all the day:
LINE 421: Spoils of my arms, and thine; when, wasting wide,
LINE 422: Our swords kept time, and conquer'd side by side."
LINE 423: He spoke, and bade the sad attendants round
LINE 424: Cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour'd wound.
LINE 425: A massy caldron of stupendous frame
LINE 426: They brought, and placed it o'er the rising flame:
LINE 427: Then heap'd the lighted wood; the flame divides
LINE 428: Beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides:
LINE 429: In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;
LINE 430: The boiling water bubbles to the brim.
LINE 431: The body then they bathe with pious toil,
LINE 432: Embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil,
LINE 433: High on a bed of state extended laid,
LINE 434: And decent cover'd with a linen shade;
LINE 435: Last o'er the dead the milk-white veil they threw;
LINE 436: That done, their sorrows and their sighs renew.
LINE 437: Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above,
LINE 438: (His wife and sister,) spoke almighty Jove.
LINE 439: "At last thy will prevails: great Peleus' son
LINE 440: Rises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won.
LINE 441: Say (for I know not), is their race divine,
LINE 442: And thou the mother of that martial line?"
LINE 443: "What words are these? (the imperial dame replies,
LINE 444: While anger flash'd from her majestic eyes)
LINE 445: Succour like this a mortal arm might lend,
LINE 446: And such success mere human wit attend:
LINE 447: And shall not I, the second power above,
LINE 448: Heaven's queen, and consort of the thundering Jove,
LINE 449: Say, shall not I one nation's fate command,
LINE 450: Not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?"
LINE 451: [Illustration: ] TRIPOD
LINE 452: So they. Meanwhile the silver-footed dame
LINE 453: Reach'd the Vulcanian dome, eternal frame!
LINE 454: High-eminent amid the works divine,
LINE 455: Where heaven's far-beaming brazen mansions shine.
LINE 456: There the lame architect the goddess found,
LINE 457: Obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round,
LINE 458: While bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew;
LINE 459: And puffing loud, the roaring billows blew.
LINE 460: That day no common task his labour claim'd:
LINE 461: Full twenty tripods for his hall he framed,
LINE 462: That placed on living wheels of massy gold,
LINE 463: (Wondrous to tell,) instinct with spirit roll'd
LINE 464: From place to place, around the bless'd abodes
LINE 465: Self-moved, obedient to the beck of gods:
LINE 466: For their fair handles now, o'erwrought with flowers,
LINE 467: In moulds prepared, the glowing ore he pours.
LINE 468: Just as responsive to his thought the frame
LINE 469: Stood prompt to move, the azure goddess came:
LINE 470: Charis, his spouse, a grace divinely fair,
LINE 471: (With purple fillets round her braided hair,)
LINE 472: Observed her entering; her soft hand she press'd,
LINE 473: And, smiling, thus the watery queen address'd:
LINE 474: "What, goddess! this unusual favour draws?
LINE 475: All hail, and welcome! whatsoe'er the cause;
LINE 476: Till now a stranger, in a happy hour
LINE 477: Approach, and taste the dainties of the bower."
LINE 478: [Illustration: ] THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN
LINE 479: High on a throne, with stars of silver graced,
LINE 480: And various artifice, the queen she placed;
LINE 481: A footstool at her feet: then calling, said,
LINE 482: "Vulcan, draw near, 'tis Thetis asks your aid."
LINE 483: "Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claim,
LINE 484: An ever-dear, an ever-honour'd name!
LINE 485: When my proud mother hurl'd me from the sky,
LINE 486: (My awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,)
LINE 487: She, and Eurynome, my griefs redress'd,
LINE 488: And soft received me on their silver breast.
LINE 489: Even then these arts employ'd my infant thought:
LINE 490: Chains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, I wrought.
LINE 491: Nine years kept secret in the dark abode,
LINE 492: Secure I lay, conceal'd from man and god:
LINE 493: Deep in a cavern'd rock my days were led;
LINE 494: The rushing ocean murmur'd o'er my head.
LINE 495: Now, since her presence glads our mansion, say,
LINE 496: For such desert what service can I pay?
LINE 497: Vouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share
LINE 498: The genial rites, and hospitable fare;
LINE 499: While I the labours of the forge forego,
LINE 500: And bid the roaring bellows cease to blow."
LINE 501: Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;
LINE 502: Wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,
LINE 503: And stills the bellows, and (in order laid)
LINE 504: Locks in their chests his instruments of trade.
LINE 505: Then with a sponge the sooty workman dress'd
LINE 506: His brawny arms embrown'd, and hairy breast.
LINE 507: With his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,
LINE 508: Came halting forth the sovereign of the fire:
LINE 509: The monarch's steps two female forms uphold,
LINE 510: That moved and breathed in animated gold;
LINE 511: To whom was voice, and sense, and science given
LINE 512: Of works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)
LINE 513: On these supported, with unequal gait,
LINE 514: He reach'd the throne where pensive Thetis sate;
LINE 515: There placed beside her on the shining frame,
LINE 516: He thus address'd the silver-footed dame:
LINE 517: "Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls
LINE 518: (So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?
LINE 519: 'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,
LINE 520: And Vulcan's joy and duty to obey."
LINE 521: [Illustration: ] VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS
LINE 522: To whom the mournful mother thus replies:
LINE 523: (The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)
LINE 524: "O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine
LINE 525: So pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?
LINE 526: Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare
LINE 527: For Thetis only such a weight of care?
LINE 528: I, only I, of all the watery race
LINE 529: By force subjected to a man's embrace,
LINE 530: Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays
LINE 531: The mighty fine imposed on length of days.
LINE 532: Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,
LINE 533: The bravest sure that ever bore the name;
LINE 534: Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
LINE 535: He grew, he flourish'd, and adorn'd the land!
LINE 536: To Troy I sent him! but his native shore
LINE 537: Never, ah never, shall receive him more;
LINE 538: (Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)
LINE 539: Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!
LINE 540: Robb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,
LINE 541: The king of nations forced his royal slave:
LINE 542: For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd
LINE 543: Required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.
LINE 544: Large gifts they promise, and their elders send;
LINE 545: In vain—he arms not, but permits his friend
LINE 546: His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:
LINE 547: He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:
LINE 548: Then slain by Phœbus (Hector had the name)
LINE 549: At once resigns his armour, life, and fame.
LINE 550: But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:
LINE 551: Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,
LINE 552: And to the field in martial pomp restore,
LINE 553: To shine with glory, till he shines no more!"
LINE 554: To her the artist-god: "Thy griefs resign,
LINE 555: Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.
LINE 556: O could I hide him from the Fates, as well,
LINE 557: Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,
LINE 558: As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze
LINE 559: Of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!"
LINE 560: Thus having said, the father of the fires
LINE 561: To the black labours of his forge retires.
LINE 562: Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd
LINE 563: Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd,
LINE 564: Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,
LINE 565: And twenty forges catch at once the fires;
LINE 566: Just as the god directs, now loud, now low,
LINE 567: They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;
LINE 568: In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,
LINE 569: And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;
LINE 570: Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;
LINE 571: The ponderous hammer loads his better hand,
LINE 572: His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,
LINE 573: And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.
LINE 574: Then first he form'd the immense and solid shield;
LINE 575: Rich various artifice emblazed the field;
LINE 576: Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;[253]
LINE 577: A silver chain suspends the massy round;
LINE 578: Five ample plates the broad expanse compose,
LINE 579: And godlike labours on the surface rose.
LINE 580: There shone the image of the master-mind:
LINE 581: There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;
LINE 582: The unwearied sun, the moon completely round;
LINE 583: The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;
LINE 584: The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;
LINE 585: And great Orion's more refulgent beam;
LINE 586: To which, around the axle of the sky,
LINE 587: The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,
LINE 588: Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
LINE 589: Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.
LINE 590: Two cities radiant on the shield appear,
LINE 591: The image one of peace, and one of war.
LINE 592: Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,
LINE 593: And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;
LINE 594: Along the street the new-made brides are led,
LINE 595: With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:
LINE 596: The youthful dancers in a circle bound
LINE 597: To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:
LINE 598: Through the fair streets the matrons in a row
LINE 599: Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.
LINE 600: There in the forum swarm a numerous train;
LINE 601: The subject of debate, a townsman slain:
LINE 602: One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,
LINE 603: And bade the public and the laws decide:
LINE 604: The witness is produced on either hand:
LINE 605: For this, or that, the partial people stand:
LINE 606: The appointed heralds still the noisy bands,
LINE 607: And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:
LINE 608: On seats of stone, within the sacred place,[254]
LINE 609: The reverend elders nodded o'er the case;
LINE 610: Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,
LINE 611: And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke.
LINE 612: Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
LINE 613: The prize of him who best adjudged the right.
LINE 614: Another part (a prospect differing far)[255]
LINE 615: Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
LINE 616: Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,
LINE 617: And one would pillage, one would burn the place.
LINE 618: Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,
LINE 619: A secret ambush on the foe prepare:
LINE 620: Their wives, their children, and the watchful band
LINE 621: Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
LINE 622: They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:
LINE 623: Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,
LINE 624: And gold their armour: these the squadron led,
LINE 625: August, divine, superior by the head!
LINE 626: A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
LINE 627: Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.
LINE 628: Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem
LINE 629: If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.
LINE 630: Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,
LINE 631: And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;
LINE 632: Behind them piping on their reeds they go,
LINE 633: Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.
LINE 634: In arms the glittering squadron rising round
LINE 635: Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;
LINE 636: Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,
LINE 637: And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!
LINE 638: The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;
LINE 639: They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,
LINE 640: They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;
LINE 641: The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.
LINE 642: There Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;
LINE 643: One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;
LINE 644: One held a living foe, that freshly bled
LINE 645: With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;
LINE 646: Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:
LINE 647: Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.
LINE 648: And the whole war came out, and met the eye;
LINE 649: And each bold figure seem'd to live or die.
LINE 650: A field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,[256]
LINE 651: The third time labour'd by the sweating hind;
LINE 652: The shining shares full many ploughmen guide,
LINE 653: And turn their crooked yokes on every side.
LINE 654: Still as at either end they wheel around,
LINE 655: The master meets them with his goblet crown'd;
LINE 656: The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,
LINE 657: Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:
LINE 658: Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;
LINE 659: And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.
LINE 660: Another field rose high with waving grain;
LINE 661: With bended sickles stand the reaper train:
LINE 662: Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,
LINE 663: Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.
LINE 664: With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;
LINE 665: The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;
LINE 666: And last the children, in whose arms are borne
LINE 667: (Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.
LINE 668: The rustic monarch of the field descries,
LINE 669: With silent glee, the heaps around him rise.
LINE 670: A ready banquet on the turf is laid,
LINE 671: Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.
LINE 672: The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;
LINE 673: The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.
LINE 674: Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,
LINE 675: Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;
LINE 676: A deeper dye the dangling clusters show,
LINE 677: And curl'd on silver props, in order glow:
LINE 678: A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;
LINE 679: And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.
LINE 680: To this, one pathway gently winding leads,
LINE 681: Where march a train with baskets on their heads,
LINE 682: (Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear
LINE 683: The purple product of the autumnal year.
LINE 684: To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,
LINE 685: Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;
LINE 686: In measured dance behind him move the train,
LINE 687: Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.
LINE 688: Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,
LINE 689: Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,
LINE 690: And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores
LINE 691: A rapid torrent through the rushes roars:
LINE 692: Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,
LINE 693: And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.
LINE 694: Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd;
LINE 695: And seized a bull, the master of the herd:
LINE 696: He roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;
LINE 697: They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.
LINE 698: The dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,
LINE 699: Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.
LINE 700: Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads
LINE 701: Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,
LINE 702: And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;
LINE 703: And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.
LINE 704: A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen
LINE 705: In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,
LINE 706: Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band
LINE 707: Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.
LINE 708: The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;
LINE 709: The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:
LINE 710: Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;
LINE 711: Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,
LINE 712: That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.
LINE 713: Now all at once they rise, at once descend,
LINE 714: With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,
LINE 715: Confusedly regular, the moving maze:
LINE 716: Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,
LINE 717: And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:
LINE 718: So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,
LINE 719: And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.
LINE 720: The gazing multitudes admire around:
LINE 721: Two active tumblers in the centre bound;
LINE 722: Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:
LINE 723: And general songs the sprightly revel end.
LINE 724: Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd
LINE 725: With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:
LINE 726: In living silver seem'd the waves to roll,
LINE 727: And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.
LINE 728: This done, whate'er a warrior's use requires
LINE 729: He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,
LINE 730: The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd
LINE 731: With various sculpture, and the golden crest.
LINE 732: At Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:
LINE 733: She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,
LINE 734: Swift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,
LINE 735: And bears the blazing present through the skies.[257]
