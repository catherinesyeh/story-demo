LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.
LINE 3: Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector
LINE 4: in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly
LINE 5: incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions;
LINE 6: she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of
LINE 7: the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against
LINE 8: Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he
LINE 9: is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo
LINE 10: obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle,
LINE 11: to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo
LINE 12: reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches
LINE 13: before him with his ægis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He
LINE 14: breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and
LINE 15: attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled
LINE 16: by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.
LINE 17: Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,
LINE 18: And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:
LINE 19: Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie
LINE 20: Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.
LINE 21: Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,
LINE 22: On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:
LINE 23: Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,
LINE 24: There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;
LINE 25: These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain
LINE 26: And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.
LINE 27: Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,
LINE 28: (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)
LINE 29: Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,
LINE 30: His senses wandering to the verge of death.
LINE 31: The god beheld him with a pitying look,
LINE 32: And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:
LINE 33: "O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,
LINE 34: For ever studious in promoting ill!
LINE 35: Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,
LINE 36: And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.
LINE 37: Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand
LINE 38: Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?
LINE 39: Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,
LINE 40: From the vast concave of the spangled sky,
LINE 41: I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,
LINE 42: And all the raging gods opposed in vain?
LINE 43: Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall,
LINE 44: Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.
LINE 45: For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,
LINE 46: Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:
LINE 47: When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd
LINE 48: The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast,
LINE 49: Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,
LINE 50: And sent to Argos, and his native shore.
LINE 51: Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,
LINE 52: Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;
LINE 53: Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,
LINE 54: Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love."
LINE 55: The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,
LINE 56: And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:
LINE 57: "By every oath that powers immortal ties,
LINE 58: The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;
LINE 59: By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow
LINE 60: Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;
LINE 61: By the dread honours of thy sacred head,
LINE 62: And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!
LINE 63: Not by my arts the ruler of the main
LINE 64: Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:
LINE 65: By his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,
LINE 66: To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey'd:
LINE 67: Else had thy Juno better counsels given,
LINE 68: And taught submission to the sire of heaven."
LINE 69: "Think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!
LINE 70: (The immortal father with a smile replies;)
LINE 71: Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,
LINE 72: Nor dare to act but when we point the way.
LINE 73: If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will
LINE 74: To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;
LINE 75: Our high decree let various Iris know,
LINE 76: And call the god that bears the silver bow.
LINE 77: Let her descend, and from the embattled plain
LINE 78: Command the sea-god to his watery reign:
LINE 79: While Phœbus hastes great Hector to prepare
LINE 80: To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:
LINE 81: His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,
LINE 82: And calls his senses from the verge of death.
LINE 83: Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet,
LINE 84: Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.
LINE 85: He, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain
LINE 86: Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.
LINE 87: What youths he slaughters under Ilion's walls!
LINE 88: Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!
LINE 89: Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he lies.
LINE 90: Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:
LINE 91: And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.
LINE 92: From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,
LINE 93: Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.
LINE 94: Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,
LINE 95: Nor one of all the heavenly host engage
LINE 96: In aid of Greece. The promise of a god
LINE 97: I gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,
LINE 98: Achilles' glory to the stars to raise;
LINE 99: Such was our word, and fate the word obeys."
LINE 100: The trembling queen (the almighty order given)
LINE 101: Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.
LINE 102: As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er
LINE 103: In thought a length of lands he trod before,
LINE 104: Sends forth his active mind from place to place,
LINE 105: Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:
LINE 106: So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,
LINE 107: If thought of man can match the speed of gods.
LINE 108: There sat the powers in awful synod placed;
LINE 109: They bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd
LINE 110: Through all the brazen dome:[239] with goblets crown'd
LINE 111: They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.
LINE 112: Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,
LINE 113: And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?
LINE 114: To whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies:
LINE 115: "Enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,
LINE 116: Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,
LINE 117: Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.
LINE 118: Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;
LINE 119: Bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall:
LINE 120: But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome
LINE 121: Such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,
LINE 122: As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,
LINE 123: And damp the eternal banquets of the skies."
LINE 124: The goddess said, and sullen took her place;
LINE 125: Black horror sadden'd each celestial face.
LINE 126: To see the gathering grudge in every breast,
LINE 127: Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd;
LINE 128: While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,
LINE 129: Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.
LINE 130: Thus she proceeds—"Attend, ye powers above!
LINE 131: But know, 'tis madness to contest with Jove:
LINE 132: Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.
LINE 133: Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:
LINE 134: Fierce in the majesty of power controls;
LINE 135: Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.
LINE 136: Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:
LINE 137: And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.
LINE 138: Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,
LINE 139: But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;
LINE 140: Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,
LINE 141: If that loved boasted offspring be thy own."
LINE 142: Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,
LINE 143: Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:
LINE 144: "Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;
LINE 145: Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:
LINE 146: Descending first to yon forbidden plain,
LINE 147: The god of battles dares avenge the slain;
LINE 148: Dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head
LINE 149: Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead."
LINE 150: With that he gives command to Fear and Flight
LINE 151: To join his rapid coursers for the fight:
LINE 152: Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;
LINE 153: Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.
LINE 154: And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,
LINE 155: Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;
LINE 156: But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,
LINE 157: Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.
LINE 158: Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,
LINE 159: From frantic Mars she snatch'd the shield and spear;
LINE 160: Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,
LINE 161: Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:
LINE 162: "By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?
LINE 163: Striv'st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.
LINE 164: Shall not the Thunderer's dread command restrain,
LINE 165: And was imperial Juno heard in vain?
LINE 166: Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,
LINE 167: And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?
LINE 168: Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,
LINE 169: The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;
LINE 170: Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate
LINE 171: And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.
LINE 172: Cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call;
LINE 173: Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.
LINE 174: Why should heaven's law with foolish man comply
LINE 175: Exempted from the race ordain'd to die?"
LINE 176: This menace fix'd the warrior to his throne;
LINE 177: Sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.
LINE 178: Then Juno call'd (Jove's orders to obey)
LINE 179: The winged Iris, and the god of day.
LINE 180: "Go wait the Thunderer's will (Saturnia cried)
LINE 181: On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:
LINE 182: There in the father's awful presence stand,
LINE 183: Receive, and execute his dread command."
LINE 184: She said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,
LINE 185: And various Iris, wing their airy way.
LINE 186: Swift as the wind, to Ida's hills they came,
LINE 187: (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)
LINE 188: There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls
LINE 189: The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.
LINE 190: Veil'd in a mist of fragrance him they found,
LINE 191: With clouds of gold and purple circled round.
LINE 192: Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,
LINE 193: And prompt obedience to the queen of air;
LINE 194: Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)
LINE 195: Commands the goddess of the showery bow:
LINE 196: "Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,
LINE 197: Report to yon mad tyrant of the main.
LINE 198: Bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,
LINE 199: Or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.
LINE 200: If he refuse, then let him timely weigh
LINE 201: Our elder birthright, and superior sway.
LINE 202: How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,
LINE 203: If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
LINE 204: Strives he with me, by whom his power was given,
LINE 205: And is there equal to the lord of heaven?"
LINE 206: The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing'd her flight
LINE 207: To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.
LINE 208: Swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,
LINE 209: Drive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;
LINE 210: So from the clouds descending Iris falls,
LINE 211: And to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:
LINE 212: "Attend the mandate of the sire above!
LINE 213: In me behold the messenger of Jove:
LINE 214: He bids thee from forbidden wars repair
LINE 215: To thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.
LINE 216: This if refused, he bids thee timely weigh
LINE 217: His elder birthright, and superior sway.
LINE 218: How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms
LINE 219: If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
LINE 220: Striv'st thou with him by whom all power is given?
LINE 221: And art thou equal to the lord of heaven?"
LINE 222: "What means the haughty sovereign of the skies?
LINE 223: (The king of ocean thus, incensed, replies;)
LINE 224: Rule as he will his portion'd realms on high;
LINE 225: No vassal god, nor of his train, am I.
LINE 226: Three brother deities from Saturn came,
LINE 227: And ancient Rhea, earth's immortal dame:
LINE 228: Assign'd by lot, our triple rule we know;
LINE 229: Infernal Pluto sways the shades below;
LINE 230: O'er the wide clouds, and o'er the starry plain,
LINE 231: Ethereal Jove extends his high domain;
LINE 232: My court beneath the hoary waves I keep,
LINE 233: And hush the roarings of the sacred deep;
LINE 234: Olympus, and this earth, in common lie:
LINE 235: What claim has here the tyrant of the sky?
LINE 236: Far in the distant clouds let him control,
LINE 237: And awe the younger brothers of the pole;
LINE 238: There to his children his commands be given,
LINE 239: The trembling, servile, second race of heaven."
LINE 240: "And must I then (said she), O sire of floods!
LINE 241: Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?
LINE 242: Correct it yet, and change thy rash intent;
LINE 243: A noble mind disdains not to repent.
LINE 244: To elder brothers guardian fiends are given,
LINE 245: To scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven."
LINE 246: "Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin'd)
LINE 247: When ministers are blest with prudent mind:
LINE 248: Warn'd by thy words, to powerful Jove I yield,
LINE 249: And quit, though angry, the contended field:
LINE 250: Not but his threats with justice I disclaim,
LINE 251: The same our honours, and our birth the same.
LINE 252: If yet, forgetful of his promise given
LINE 253: To Hermes, Pallas, and the queen of heaven,
LINE 254: To favour Ilion, that perfidious place,
LINE 255: He breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;
LINE 256: Give him to know, unless the Grecian train
LINE 257: Lay yon proud structures level with the plain,
LINE 258: Howe'er the offence by other gods be pass'd,
LINE 259: The wrath of Neptune shall for ever last."
LINE 260: Thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,
LINE 261: And plunged into the bosom of the flood.
LINE 262: The lord of thunders, from his lofty height
LINE 263: Beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:
LINE 264: "Behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl'd
LINE 265: Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,
LINE 266: Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,
LINE 267: Seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;
LINE 268: Else had my wrath, heaven's thrones all shaking round,
LINE 269: Burn'd to the bottom of his seas profound;
LINE 270: And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell
LINE 271: Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.
LINE 272: Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;
LINE 273: Even power immense had found such battle hard.
LINE 274: Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,
LINE 275: Shake my broad ægis on thy active arm,
LINE 276: Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,
LINE 277: Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:
LINE 278: Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train
LINE 279: Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:
LINE 280: Then Greece shall breathe from toils." The godhead said;
LINE 281: His will divine the son of Jove obey'd.
LINE 282: Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,
LINE 283: That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,
LINE 284: As Phœbus, shooting from the Idaean brow,
LINE 285: Glides down the mountain to the plain below.
LINE 286: There Hector seated by the stream he sees,
LINE 287: His sense returning with the coming breeze;
LINE 288: Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;
LINE 289: Again his loved companions meet his eyes;
LINE 290: Jove thinking of his pains, they pass'd away,
LINE 291: To whom the god who gives the golden day:
LINE 292: "Why sits great Hector from the field so far?
LINE 293: What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?"
LINE 294: The fainting hero, as the vision bright
LINE 295: Stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight:
LINE 296: "What blest immortal, with commanding breath,
LINE 297: Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?
LINE 298: Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword
LINE 299: Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,
LINE 300: The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow
LINE 301: Had almost sunk me to the shades below?
LINE 302: Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,
LINE 303: And hell's black horrors swim before my eye."
LINE 304: To him Apollo: "Be no more dismay'd;
LINE 305: See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.
LINE 306: Behold! thy Phœbus shall his arms employ,
LINE 307: Phœbus, propitious still to thee and Troy.
LINE 308: Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,
LINE 309: And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:
LINE 310: Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,
LINE 311: And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea."
LINE 312: Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,
LINE 313: And breathed immortal ardour from above.
LINE 314: As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,
LINE 315: Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;
LINE 316: With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,
LINE 317: To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;
LINE 318: His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;
LINE 319: His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:
LINE 320: He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,
LINE 321: And springs, exulting, to his fields again:
LINE 322: Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,
LINE 323: Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.
LINE 324: As when the force of men and dogs combined
LINE 325: Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;
LINE 326: Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie
LINE 327: Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)
LINE 328: When lo! a lion shoots across the way!
LINE 329: They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.
LINE 330: So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,
LINE 331: And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,
LINE 332: Soon as they see the furious chief appear,
LINE 333: Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.
LINE 334: Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,
LINE 335: Thoas, the bravest of the Ætolian force;
LINE 336: Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,
LINE 337: And bold to combat in the standing fight,
LINE 338: Not more in councils famed for solid sense,
LINE 339: Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.
LINE 340: "Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?
LINE 341: Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!
LINE 342: We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:
LINE 343: What god restores him to the frighted field;
LINE 344: And not content that half of Greece lie slain,
LINE 345: Pours new destruction on her sons again?
LINE 346: He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;
LINE 347: Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!
LINE 348: Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:
LINE 349: The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;
LINE 350: But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,
LINE 351: Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.
LINE 352: Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,
LINE 353: Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear."
LINE 354: The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,
LINE 355: Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.
LINE 356: Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,
LINE 357: The valiant leader of the Cretan band;
LINE 358: And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,
LINE 359: Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.
LINE 360: Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,
LINE 361: To flank the navy, and the shores defend.
LINE 362: Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,
LINE 363: And Hector first came towering to the war.
LINE 364: Phœbus himself the rushing battle led;
LINE 365: A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:
LINE 366: High held before him, Jove's enormous shield
LINE 367: Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;
LINE 368: Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,
LINE 369: To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,
LINE 370: The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise
LINE 371: From different parts, and mingle in the skies.
LINE 372: Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,
LINE 373: And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;
LINE 374: These drink the life of generous warriors slain:
LINE 375: Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.
LINE 376: As long as Phœbus bore unmoved the shield,
LINE 377: Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;
LINE 378: But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,
LINE 379: Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,
LINE 380: Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,
LINE 381: Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.
LINE 382: So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,
LINE 383: No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,
LINE 384: When two fell lions from the mountain come,
LINE 385: And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.
LINE 386: Impending Phœbus pours around them fear,
LINE 387: And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.
LINE 388: Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,
LINE 389: First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;
LINE 390: One to the bold Bœotians ever dear,
LINE 391: And one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer.
LINE 392: Medon and Iasus, Æneas sped;
LINE 393: This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;
LINE 394: But hapless Medon from Oïleus came;
LINE 395: Him Ajax honour'd with a brother's name,
LINE 396: Though born of lawless love: from home expell'd,
LINE 397: A banish'd man, in Phylacè he dwell'd,
LINE 398: Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;
LINE 399: Troy ends at last his labours and his life.
LINE 400: Mecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew;
LINE 401: And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.
LINE 402: By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,
LINE 403: Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.
LINE 404: Polites' arm laid Echius on the plain;
LINE 405: Stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.
LINE 406: The Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,
LINE 407: Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.
LINE 408: While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,
LINE 409: And o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.
LINE 410: On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;
LINE 411: Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,
LINE 412: Points to the fleet: "For, by the gods! who flies,[240]
LINE 413: Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;
LINE 414: No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,
LINE 415: No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.
LINE 416: Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,
LINE 417: The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour."
LINE 418: Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;
LINE 419: The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;
LINE 420: The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;
LINE 421: The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!
LINE 422: Apollo, planted at the trench's bound,
LINE 423: Push'd at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:
LINE 424: Roll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;
LINE 425: A sudden road! a long and ample way.
LINE 426: O'er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)
LINE 427: Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.
LINE 428: The wondering crowds the downward level trod;
LINE 429: Before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.
LINE 430: Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;
LINE 431: And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:
LINE 432: Easy as when ashore an infant stands,
LINE 433: And draws imagined houses in the sands;
LINE 434: The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,
LINE 435: Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away:
LINE 436: Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls;
LINE 437: The toil of thousands in a moment falls.
LINE 438: The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,
LINE 439: Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:
LINE 440: Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;
LINE 441: And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.
LINE 442: Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,
LINE 443: And weeps his country with a father's eyes.
LINE 444: "O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,
LINE 445: One Greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore;
LINE 446: If e'er, in hope our country to behold,
LINE 447: We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;
LINE 448: If e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod:
LINE 449: Perform the promise of a gracious god!
LINE 450: This day preserve our navies from the flame,
LINE 451: And save the relics of the Grecian name."
LINE 452: Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,
LINE 453: And peals of thunder shook the firmament.
LINE 454: Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,
LINE 455: And catch'd new fury at the voice divine.
LINE 456: As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,
LINE 457: The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,
LINE 458: Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,
LINE 459: Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:
LINE 460: Thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,
LINE 461: Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;
LINE 462: Legions on legions from each side arise:
LINE 463: Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.
LINE 464: Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,
LINE 465: These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.
LINE 466: While thus the thunder of the battle raged,
LINE 467: And labouring armies round the works engaged,
LINE 468: Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend
LINE 469: The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.
LINE 470: He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,
LINE 471: And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.
LINE 472: But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,
LINE 473: Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,
LINE 474: With bitter groans his sorrows he express'd,
LINE 475: He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.
LINE 476: "Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)
LINE 477: Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!
LINE 478: Charged with Achilles' high command I go,
LINE 479: A mournful witness of this scene of woe;
LINE 480: I haste to urge him by his country's care
LINE 481: To rise in arms, and shine again in war.
LINE 482: Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;
LINE 483: The voice is powerful of a faithful friend."
LINE 484: He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind
LINE 485: Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.
LINE 486: The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,
LINE 487: But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:
LINE 488: Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,
LINE 489: Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.
LINE 490: As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,
LINE 491: Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;
LINE 492: With equal hand he guides his whole design,
LINE 493: By the just rule, and the directing line:
LINE 494: The martial leaders, with like skill and care,
LINE 495: Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.
LINE 496: Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,
LINE 497: And every ship sustained an equal tide.
LINE 498: At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,
LINE 499: Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;
LINE 500: For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,
LINE 501: Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:
LINE 502: One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;
LINE 503: That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.
LINE 504: The son of Clytius in his daring hand,
LINE 505: The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;
LINE 506: But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires:
LINE 507: Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.
LINE 508: Great Hector view'd him with a sad survey,
LINE 509: As stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.
LINE 510: "Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!
LINE 511: Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:
LINE 512: Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;
LINE 513: Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!"
LINE 514: This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:
LINE 515: But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.
LINE 516: Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;
LINE 517: It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:
LINE 518: An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board,
LINE 519: A faithful servant to a foreign lord;
LINE 520: In peace, and war, for ever at his side,
LINE 521: Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.
LINE 522: From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,
LINE 523: And lies a lifeless load along the land.
LINE 524: With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,
LINE 525: And thus inflames his brother to the fight:
LINE 526: "Teucer, behold! extended on the shore
LINE 527: Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!
LINE 528: Dear as a parent, with a parent's care
LINE 529: To fight our wars he left his native air.
LINE 530: This death deplored, to Hector's rage we owe;
LINE 531: Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.
LINE 532: Where are those darts on which the fates attend?
LINE 533: And where the bow which Phœbus taught to bend?"
LINE 534: Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,
LINE 535: Before the chief his ample bow display'd;
LINE 536: The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:
LINE 537: Then hiss'd his arrow, and the bowstring sung.
LINE 538: Clytus, Pisenor's son, renown'd in fame,
LINE 539: (To thee, Polydamas! an honour'd name)
LINE 540: Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains
LINE 541: The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.
LINE 542: As all on glory ran his ardent mind,
LINE 543: The pointed death arrests him from behind:
LINE 544: Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;
LINE 545: In youth's first bloom reluctantly he dies.
LINE 546: Hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far,
LINE 547: The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;
LINE 548: Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain'd,
LINE 549: And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;
LINE 550: Then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe:
LINE 551: Rage edged his sword, and strengthen'd every blow.
LINE 552: Once more bold Teucer, in his country's cause,
LINE 553: At Hector's breast a chosen arrow draws:
LINE 554: And had the weapon found the destined way,
LINE 555: Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown'd that day.
LINE 556: But Hector was not doom'd to perish then:
LINE 557: The all-wise disposer of the fates of men
LINE 558: (Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;
LINE 559: Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.
LINE 560: At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,
LINE 561: Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;
LINE 562: Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head
LINE 563: Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.
LINE 564: The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;
LINE 565: "Some god prevents our destined enterprise:
LINE 566: Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,
LINE 567: Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,
LINE 568: And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,
LINE 569: Strong to impel the flight of many a dart."
LINE 570: "Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)
LINE 571: Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:
LINE 572: Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,
LINE 573: And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.
LINE 574: In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,
LINE 575: Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.
LINE 576: Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;
LINE 577: To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,
LINE 578: Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might
LINE 579: Shall find its match—No more: 'tis ours to fight."
LINE 580: Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;
LINE 581: The fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied;
LINE 582: On his brave head a crested helm he placed,
LINE 583: With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
LINE 584: A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,
LINE 585: The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.
LINE 586: This Hector saw, and thus express'd his joy:
LINE 587: "Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!
LINE 588: Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,
LINE 589: And spread your glory with the navy's flame.
LINE 590: Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,
LINE 591: From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:
LINE 592: Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,
LINE 593: When happy nations bear the marks divine!
LINE 594: How easy then, to see the sinking state
LINE 595: Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!
LINE 596: Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:
LINE 597: Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.
LINE 598: Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;
LINE 599: And for our country, 'tis a bliss to die.
LINE 600: The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,
LINE 601: Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;
LINE 602: Entails a debt on all the grateful state;
LINE 603: His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;
LINE 604: His wife live honour'd, all his race succeed,
LINE 605: And late posterity enjoy the deed!"
LINE 606: This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:
LINE 607: The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address'd:
LINE 608: "How long, ye warriors of the Argive race,
LINE 609: (To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)
LINE 610: How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,
LINE 611: Yet undetermined, or to live or die?
LINE 612: What hopes remain, what methods to retire,
LINE 613: If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?
LINE 614: Mark how the flames approach, how near they fall,
LINE 615: How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!
LINE 616: Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,
LINE 617: It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.
LINE 618: 'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;
LINE 619: To your own hands are trusted all your fates;
LINE 620: And better far in one decisive strife,
LINE 621: One day should end our labour or our life,
LINE 622: Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,
LINE 623: Still press'd, and press'd by such inglorious hands."
LINE 624: The listening Grecians feel their leader's flame,
LINE 625: And every kindling bosom pants for fame.
LINE 626: Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;
LINE 627: By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;
LINE 628: There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,
LINE 629: Chief of the foot, of old Antenor's race.
LINE 630: Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,
LINE 631: The fierce commander of the Epeian band.
LINE 632: His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;
LINE 633: The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;
LINE 634: (That valued life, O Phœbus! was thy care)
LINE 635: But Croesmus' bosom took the flying spear:
LINE 636: His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;
LINE 637: His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.
LINE 638: Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,
LINE 639: Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,
LINE 640: And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,
LINE 641: He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:
LINE 642: But Meges, Phyleus' ample breastplate wore,
LINE 643: (Well-known in fight on Sellè's winding shore;
LINE 644: For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,
LINE 645: Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)
LINE 646: Which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,
LINE 647: Had saved the father, and now saves the son.
LINE 648: Full at the Trojan's head he urged his lance,
LINE 649: Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,
LINE 650: New ting'd with Tyrian dye: in dust below,
LINE 651: Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.
LINE 652: Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey'd,
LINE 653: And stood by Meges' side a sudden aid.
LINE 654: Through Dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,
LINE 655: Which held its passage through the panting heart,
LINE 656: And issued at his breast. With thundering sound
LINE 657: The warrior falls, extended on the ground.
LINE 658: In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:
LINE 659: But Hector's voice excites his kindred train;
LINE 660: The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,
LINE 661: Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.
LINE 662: He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)
LINE 663: Fed his large oxen on Percotè's plain;
LINE 664: But when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,
LINE 665: Return'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;
LINE 666: For this, in Priam's court, he held his place,
LINE 667: Beloved no less than Priam's royal race.
LINE 668: Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,
LINE 669: And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.
LINE 670: "Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;
LINE 671: And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?
LINE 672: O'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,
LINE 673: And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!
LINE 674: Come on—a distant war no longer wage,
LINE 675: But hand to hand thy country's foes engage:
LINE 676: Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;
LINE 677: Or Ilion from her towery height descend,
LINE 678: Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all
LINE 679: In one sad sepulchre, one common fall."
LINE 680: Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:
LINE 681: With equal ardour Melanippus glows:
LINE 682: Then Ajax thus—"O Greeks! respect your fame,
LINE 683: Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:
LINE 684: Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,
LINE 685: And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,
LINE 686: On valour's side the odds of combat lie;
LINE 687: The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
LINE 688: The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,
LINE 689: Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame."
LINE 690: His generous sense he not in vain imparts;
LINE 691: It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:
LINE 692: They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,
LINE 693: And flank the navy with a brazen wall;
LINE 694: Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,
LINE 695: And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.
LINE 696: The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.
LINE 697: Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.
LINE 698: "Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,
LINE 699: So strong to fight, so active to pursue?
LINE 700: Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?
LINE 701: Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed."
LINE 702: He said; and backward to the lines retired;
LINE 703: Forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,
LINE 704: Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,
LINE 705: And round the black battalions cast his view.
LINE 706: The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,
LINE 707: While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.
LINE 708: Advancing Melanippus met the dart
LINE 709: With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:
LINE 710: Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,
LINE 711: And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
LINE 712: The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:
LINE 713: Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,
LINE 714: And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart
LINE 715: The distant hunter sent into his heart.
LINE 716: Observing Hector to the rescue flew;
LINE 717: Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.
LINE 718: So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,
LINE 719: Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,
LINE 720: While conscious of the deed, he glares around,
LINE 721: And hears the gathering multitude resound,
LINE 722: Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,
LINE 723: And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:
LINE 724: So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,
LINE 725: While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;
LINE 726: But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns
LINE 727: His manly breast, and with new fury burns.
LINE 728: Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,
LINE 729: Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:
LINE 730: The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,
LINE 731: The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;
LINE 732: But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,
LINE 733: Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.
LINE 734: On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,
LINE 735: To view the navy blazing to the skies;
LINE 736: Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,
LINE 737: The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.
LINE 738: These fates revolved in his almighty mind,
LINE 739: He raises Hector to the work design'd,
LINE 740: Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,
LINE 741: And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.
LINE 742: So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,
LINE 743: Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.
LINE 744: Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,
LINE 745: Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.
LINE 746: He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow
LINE 747: Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:
LINE 748: The radiant helmet on his temple burns,
LINE 749: Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:
LINE 750: For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,
LINE 751: And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.
LINE 752: Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,
LINE 753: Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:
LINE 754: Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,
LINE 755: And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!
LINE 756: Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes
LINE 757: Burn at each foe, and single every prize;
LINE 758: Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,
LINE 759: He points his ardour, and exerts his might.
LINE 760: The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,
LINE 761: On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:
LINE 762: So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,[241]
LINE 763: By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,
LINE 764: Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,
LINE 765: And sees the watery mountains break below.
LINE 766: Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall
LINE 767: Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:
LINE 768: Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
LINE 769: And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;
LINE 770: White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud
LINE 771: Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:
LINE 772: Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;
LINE 773: And instant death on every wave appears.
LINE 774: So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,
LINE 775: The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.
LINE 776: As when a lion, rushing from his den,
LINE 777: Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,
LINE 778: (Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,
LINE 779: At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)
LINE 780: Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;
LINE 781: The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;
LINE 782: Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)
LINE 783: He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.
LINE 784: Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew
LINE 785: All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:
LINE 786: Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,
LINE 787: In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;
LINE 788: The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire
LINE 789: Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:
LINE 790: The son redeem'd the honours of the race,
LINE 791: A son as generous as the sire was base;
LINE 792: O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far
LINE 793: In every virtue, or of peace or war:
LINE 794: But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!
LINE 795: Against the margin of his ample shield
LINE 796: He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;
LINE 797: Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.
LINE 798: On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,
LINE 799: And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.
LINE 800: His circling friends, who strove to guard too late
LINE 801: The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.
LINE 802: Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train
LINE 803: Now man the next, receding toward the main:
LINE 804: Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,
LINE 805: Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.
LINE 806: Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;
LINE 807: Now fear itself confines them to the fight:
LINE 808: Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most
LINE 809: (The sage preserver of the Grecian host)
LINE 810: Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;
LINE 811: And by their parents, by themselves implores.
LINE 812: "Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame
LINE 813: With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!
LINE 814: Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care
LINE 815: Your wives, your infants, and your parents share:
LINE 816: Think of each living father's reverend head;
LINE 817: Think of each ancestor with glory dead;
LINE 818: Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,
LINE 819: They ask their safety, and their fame, from you:
LINE 820: The gods their fates on this one action lay,
LINE 821: And all are lost, if you desert the day."
LINE 822: He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;
LINE 823: Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.
LINE 824: The mist of darkness Jove around them threw
LINE 825: She clear'd, restoring all the war to view;
LINE 826: A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,
LINE 827: And show'd the shores, the navy, and the main:
LINE 828: Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,
LINE 829: The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,
LINE 830: First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,
LINE 831: His port majestic, and his ample size:
LINE 832: A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,
LINE 833: Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;
LINE 834: Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands
LINE 835: But looks a moving tower above the bands;
LINE 836: High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,
LINE 837: The godlike hero stalks from side to side.
LINE 838: So when a horseman from the watery mead
LINE 839: (Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)
LINE 840: Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,
LINE 841: To some great city through the public way;
LINE 842: Safe in his art, as side by side they run,
LINE 843: He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;
LINE 844: And now to this, and now to that he flies;
LINE 845: Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.
LINE 846: From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,
LINE 847: No less the wonder of the warring crew.
LINE 848: As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud,
LINE 849: And rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd;
LINE 850: Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores
LINE 851: Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;
LINE 852: So the strong eagle from his airy height,
LINE 853: Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,
LINE 854: Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,
LINE 855: And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.
LINE 856: Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,
LINE 857: And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.
LINE 858: The warring nations meet, the battle roars,
LINE 859: Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.
LINE 860: Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,
LINE 861: No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;
LINE 862: As if new vigour from new fights they won,
LINE 863: And the long battle was but then begun.
LINE 864: Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,
LINE 865: Secure of death, confiding in despair:
LINE 866: Troy in proud hopes already view'd the main
LINE 867: Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:
LINE 868: Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,
LINE 869: And each contends, as his were all the war.
LINE 870: 'Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand
LINE 871: First seized a ship on that contested strand;
LINE 872: The same which dead Protesilaüs bore,[242]
LINE 873: The first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore:
LINE 874: For this in arms the warring nations stood,
LINE 875: And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.
LINE 876: No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;
LINE 877: But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:
LINE 878: Wounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts
LINE 879: With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.
LINE 880: The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,
LINE 881: Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;
LINE 882: With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,
LINE 883: And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
LINE 884: Still raging, Hector with his ample hand
LINE 885: Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:
LINE 886: [Illustration: ] AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS
LINE 887: "Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years
LINE 888: Is finished; and the day desired appears!
LINE 889: This happy day with acclamations greet,
LINE 890: Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.
LINE 891: The coward-counsels of a timorous throng
LINE 892: Of reverend dotards check'd our glory long:
LINE 893: Too long Jove lull'd us with lethargic charms,
LINE 894: But now in peals of thunder calls to arms:
LINE 895: In this great day he crowns our full desires,
LINE 896: Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires."
LINE 897: He spoke—the warriors at his fierce command
LINE 898: Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band.
LINE 899: Even Ajax paused, (so thick the javelins fly,)
LINE 900: Stepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.
LINE 901: Yet, where the oars are placed, he stands to wait
LINE 902: What chief approaching dares attempt his fate:
LINE 903: Even to the last his naval charge defends,
LINE 904: Now shakes his spear, now lifts, and now protends;
LINE 905: Even yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires,
LINE 906: Amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.
LINE 907: "O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear,
LINE 908: Once sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war!
LINE 909: Ah! yet be mindful of your old renown,
LINE 910: Your great forefathers' virtues and your own.
LINE 911: What aids expect you in this utmost strait?
LINE 912: What bulwarks rising between you and fate?
LINE 913: No aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend,
LINE 914: No friends to help, no city to defend.
LINE 915: This spot is all you have, to lose or keep;
LINE 916: There stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep.
LINE 917: 'Tis hostile ground you tread; your native lands
LINE 918: Far, far from hence: your fates are in your hands."
LINE 919: Raging he spoke; nor further wastes his breath,
LINE 920: But turns his javelin to the work of death.
LINE 921: Whate'er bold Trojan arm'd his daring hands,
LINE 922: Against the sable ships, with flaming brands,
LINE 923: So well the chief his naval weapon sped,
LINE 924: The luckless warrior at his stern lay dead:
LINE 925: Full twelve, the boldest, in a moment fell,
LINE 926: Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.
