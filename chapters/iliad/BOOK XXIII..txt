LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.[280]
LINE 3: Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After
LINE 4: the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,
LINE 5: the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of
LINE 6: burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons
LINE 7: to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering
LINE 8: their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly
LINE 9: twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays
LINE 10: libations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise
LINE 11: the flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones,
LINE 12: place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes
LINE 13: the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the
LINE 14: wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting
LINE 15: with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of
LINE 16: which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the
LINE 17: greatest part of the book.
LINE 18: In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost
LINE 19: of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is
LINE 20: employed in felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth
LINE 21: in burning it; and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene
LINE 22: is generally on the sea-shore.
LINE 23: Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train
LINE 24: Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.
LINE 25: The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,
LINE 26: Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.
LINE 27: The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,
LINE 28: All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:
LINE 29: These yet assembled great Achilles holds,
LINE 30: And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:
LINE 31: "Not yet, my brave companions of the war,
LINE 32: Release your smoking coursers from the car;
LINE 33: But, with his chariot each in order led,
LINE 34: Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.
LINE 35: Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,
LINE 36: Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief."
LINE 37: The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led[281]
LINE 38: (Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;
LINE 39: And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;
LINE 40: Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.
LINE 41: For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,
LINE 42: Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.
LINE 43: But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs
LINE 44: Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:
LINE 45: His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid
LINE 46: On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:
LINE 47: "All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost
LINE 48: Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;
LINE 49: Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;
LINE 50: The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.
LINE 51: Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;
LINE 52: And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,
LINE 53: Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;
LINE 54: Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre."
LINE 55: Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)
LINE 56: Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,
LINE 57: Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around
LINE 58: Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.
LINE 59: All to Achilles' sable ship repair,
LINE 60: Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.
LINE 61: Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,
LINE 62: The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:
LINE 63: The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries
LINE 64: Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.
LINE 65: Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,
LINE 66: In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.
LINE 67: And now a band of Argive monarchs brings
LINE 68: The glorious victor to the king of kings.
LINE 69: From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,
LINE 70: With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.
LINE 71: The attending heralds, as by office bound,
LINE 72: With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:
LINE 73: To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,
LINE 74: They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:[282]
LINE 75: "No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!
LINE 76: The first and greatest of the gods above!
LINE 77: Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear
LINE 78: The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.
LINE 79: Some ease at least those pious rites may give,
LINE 80: And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.
LINE 81: Howe'er, reluctant as I am, I stay
LINE 82: And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,
LINE 83: (O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,
LINE 84: That Greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,
LINE 85: And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid
LINE 86: To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)
LINE 87: Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,
LINE 88: Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire."
LINE 89: He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;
LINE 90: The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,
LINE 91: Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.
LINE 92: But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,
LINE 93: Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,
LINE 94: Lies inly groaning; while on either hand
LINE 95: The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.
LINE 96: Along the grass his languid members fall,
LINE 97: Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;
LINE 98: Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,
LINE 99: At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.
LINE 100: When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,
LINE 101: Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:
LINE 102: In the same robe he living wore, he came:
LINE 103: In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.
LINE 104: The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,
LINE 105: "And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)
LINE 106: Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?
LINE 107: Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,
LINE 108: But now forgot, I wander in the air.
LINE 109: Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,
LINE 110: And give me entrance in the realms below:
LINE 111: Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,
LINE 112: But here and there the unbodied spectres chase
LINE 113: The vagrant dead around the dark abode,
LINE 114: Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.
LINE 115: Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore
LINE 116: When once we pass, the soul returns no more:
LINE 117: When once the last funereal flames ascend,
LINE 118: No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;
LINE 119: No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;
LINE 120: Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.
LINE 121: Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,
LINE 122: The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:
LINE 123: Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall
LINE 124: Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.
LINE 125: Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,
LINE 126: Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!
LINE 127: Together have we lived; together bred,
LINE 128: One house received us, and one table fed;
LINE 129: That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,
LINE 130: May mix our ashes in one common grave."
LINE 131: "And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight[283]
LINE 132: Once more return'st thou from the realms of night?
LINE 133: O more than brother! Think each office paid,
LINE 134: Whate'er can rest a discontented shade;
LINE 135: But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!
LINE 136: Afford at least that melancholy joy."
LINE 137: He said, and with his longing arms essay'd
LINE 138: In vain to grasp the visionary shade!
LINE 139: Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,[284]
LINE 140: And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.
LINE 141: Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands
LINE 142: Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,
LINE 143: Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:
LINE 144: "'Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains
LINE 145: Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:
LINE 146: The form subsists without the body's aid,
LINE 147: Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!
LINE 148: This night my friend, so late in battle lost,
LINE 149: Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:
LINE 150: Even now familiar, as in life, he came;
LINE 151: Alas! how different! yet how like the same!"
LINE 152: Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:
LINE 153: And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,
LINE 154: Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,
LINE 155: And glares on the pale visage of the dead.
LINE 156: But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,
LINE 157: With mules and waggons sends a chosen band
LINE 158: To load the timber, and the pile to rear;
LINE 159: A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.
LINE 160: With proper instruments they take the road,
LINE 161: Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.
LINE 162: First march the heavy mules, securely slow,
LINE 163: O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:[285]
LINE 164: Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,
LINE 165: Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound.
LINE 166: But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,[286]
LINE 167: (Fair Ida, water'd with descending floods,)
LINE 168: Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;
LINE 169: On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
LINE 170: Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;
LINE 171: Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.
LINE 172: The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;
LINE 173: And the slow mules the same rough road return.
LINE 174: The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
LINE 175: (Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;
LINE 176: There on the spot which great Achilles show'd,
LINE 177: They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;
LINE 178: Circling around the place, where times to come
LINE 179: Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb.
LINE 180: The hero bids his martial troops appear
LINE 181: High on their cars in all the pomp of war;
LINE 182: Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,
LINE 183: All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.
LINE 184: The chariots first proceed, a shining train;
LINE 185: Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;
LINE 186: Next these the melancholy band appear;
LINE 187: Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;
LINE 188: O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;
LINE 189: Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,
LINE 190: Supporting with his hands the hero's head,
LINE 191: Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.
LINE 192: Patroclus decent on the appointed ground
LINE 193: They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.
LINE 194: But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,
LINE 195: And from his head divides the yellow hair;
LINE 196: Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,[287]
LINE 197: And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:
LINE 198: Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,
LINE 199: And roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:
LINE 200: "Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost
LINE 201: Delightful roll along my native coast!
LINE 202: To whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,
LINE 203: These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:
LINE 204: Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,
LINE 205: Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,
LINE 206: And where in shade of consecrated bowers
LINE 207: Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!
LINE 208: So vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;
LINE 209: No more Achilles sees his native plain;
LINE 210: In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,
LINE 211: Patroclus bears them to the shades below."
LINE 212: Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,
LINE 213: On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.
LINE 214: Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:
LINE 215: And now the sun had set upon their woe;
LINE 216: But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:
LINE 217: "Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:
LINE 218: Permit the mourning legions to retire,
LINE 219: And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;
LINE 220: The pious care be ours, the dead to burn—"
LINE 221: He said: the people to their ships return:
LINE 222: While those deputed to inter the slain
LINE 223: Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.[288]
LINE 224: A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,
LINE 225: The growing structure spreads on every side;
LINE 226: High on the top the manly corse they lay,
LINE 227: And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:
LINE 228: Achilles covered with their fat the dead,
LINE 229: And the piled victims round the body spread;
LINE 230: Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,
LINE 231: Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.
LINE 232: Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan
LINE 233: Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.
LINE 234: Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,
LINE 235: Fall two, selected to attend their lord,
LINE 236: Then last of all, and horrible to tell,
LINE 237: Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.[289]
LINE 238: On these the rage of fire victorious preys,
LINE 239: Involves and joins them in one common blaze.
LINE 240: Smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,
LINE 241: And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]
LINE 242: "All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost
LINE 243: Hear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.
LINE 244: Behold Achilles' promise fully paid,
LINE 245: Twelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;
LINE 246: But heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,
LINE 247: Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend."
LINE 248: So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain
LINE 249: His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:
LINE 250: Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,
LINE 251: And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:
LINE 252: She watch'd him all the night and all the day,
LINE 253: And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.
LINE 254: Nor sacred Phœbus less employ'd his care;
LINE 255: He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,
LINE 256: And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,
LINE 257: Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.
LINE 258: [Illustration: ] THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS
LINE 259: Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,
LINE 260: Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;
LINE 261: But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,
LINE 262: Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,
LINE 263: And victims promised, and libations cast,
LINE 264: To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:
LINE 265: He call'd the aerial powers, along the skies
LINE 266: To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.
LINE 267: The winged Iris heard the hero's call,
LINE 268: And instant hasten'd to their airy hall,
LINE 269: Where in old Zephyr's open courts on high,
LINE 270: Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.
LINE 271: She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;
LINE 272: The rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.
LINE 273: All from the banquet rise, and each invites
LINE 274: The various goddess to partake the rites.
LINE 275: "Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go
LINE 276: To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:
LINE 277: Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,
LINE 278: And heaven is feasting on the world's green end
LINE 279: With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)
LINE 280: Far on the extremest limits of the main.
LINE 281: But Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,
LINE 282: The western spirit, and the north, to rise!
LINE 283: Let on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,
LINE 284: And bear the blazing honours high to heaven."
LINE 285: Swift as the word she vanish'd from their view;
LINE 286: Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;
LINE 287: Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,
LINE 288: And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.
LINE 289: To the wide main then stooping from the skies,
LINE 290: The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:
LINE 291: Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,
LINE 292: Till on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.
LINE 293: The structure crackles in the roaring fires,
LINE 294: And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.
LINE 295: All night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,
LINE 296: With large libations from the golden bowl.
LINE 297: As a poor father, helpless and undone,
LINE 298: Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,
LINE 299: Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,
LINE 300: And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:
LINE 301: So stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,
LINE 302: So watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.
LINE 303: 'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,
LINE 304: The morning planet told the approach of light;
LINE 305: And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray
LINE 306: O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:
LINE 307: Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,
LINE 308: And to their caves the whistling winds return'd:
LINE 309: Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;
LINE 310: The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.
LINE 311: Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,
LINE 312: And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,
LINE 313: Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd
LINE 314: Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;
LINE 315: The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook
LINE 316: Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:
LINE 317: "Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!
LINE 318: First let us quench the yet remaining flame
LINE 319: With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,
LINE 320: The hero's bones with careful view select:
LINE 321: (Apart, and easy to be known they lie
LINE 322: Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:
LINE 323: The rest around the margin will be seen
LINE 324: Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)
LINE 325: These wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;
LINE 326: And in the golden vase dispose with care;
LINE 327: There let them rest with decent honour laid,
LINE 328: Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.
LINE 329: Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,
LINE 330: A common structure on the humble sands:
LINE 331: Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,
LINE 332: And late posterity record our praise!"
LINE 333: The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,
LINE 334: Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,
LINE 335: And deep subsides the ashy heap below.
LINE 336: Next the white bones his sad companions place,
LINE 337: With tears collected, in the golden vase.
LINE 338: The sacred relics to the tent they bore;
LINE 339: The urn a veil of linen covered o'er.
LINE 340: That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,
LINE 341: And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;
LINE 342: High in the midst they heap the swelling bed
LINE 343: Of rising earth, memorial of the dead.
LINE 344: The swarming populace the chief detains,
LINE 345: And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;
LINE 346: There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds
LINE 347: A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,
LINE 348: Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),
LINE 349: Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.
LINE 350: First stood the prizes to reward the force
LINE 351: Of rapid racers in the dusty course:
LINE 352: A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,
LINE 353: Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;
LINE 354: And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,
LINE 355: Of twenty measures its capacious size.
LINE 356: The second victor claims a mare unbroke,
LINE 357: Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:
LINE 358: The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;
LINE 359: Four ample measures held the shining frame:
LINE 360: Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:
LINE 361: An ample double bowl contents the last.
LINE 362: These in fair order ranged upon the plain,
LINE 363: The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:
LINE 364: "Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed
LINE 365: To the brave rulers of the racing steed;
LINE 366: Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,
LINE 367: Should our immortal coursers take the plain;
LINE 368: (A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god
LINE 369: Peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)
LINE 370: But this no time our vigour to display;
LINE 371: Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:
LINE 372: Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck
LINE 373: Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.
LINE 374: Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,
LINE 375: And trail those graceful honours on the sand!
LINE 376: Let others for the noble task prepare,
LINE 377: Who trust the courser and the flying car."
LINE 378: Fired at his word the rival racers rise;
LINE 379: But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,
LINE 380: Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,
LINE 381: And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.
LINE 382: With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,
LINE 383: The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd
LINE 384: (Which late obey'd the Dardan chief's command,
LINE 385: When scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).
LINE 386: Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,
LINE 387: And the famed courser of the king of kings:
LINE 388: Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),
LINE 389: To 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,
LINE 390: (Æthe her name) at home to end his days;
LINE 391: Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.
LINE 392: Next him Antilochus demands the course
LINE 393: With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.
LINE 394: Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,
LINE 395: Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;
LINE 396: Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears
LINE 397: The prudent son with unattending ears.
LINE 398: "My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,
LINE 399: The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;
LINE 400: Neptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill
LINE 401: Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.
LINE 402: To guide thy conduct little precept needs;
LINE 403: But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.
LINE 404: Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;
LINE 405: Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:
LINE 406: It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,
LINE 407: And to be swift is less than to be wise.
LINE 408: 'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
LINE 409: The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;
LINE 410: By art the pilot, through the boiling deep
LINE 411: And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;
LINE 412: And 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;
LINE 413: Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.
LINE 414: In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,
LINE 415: And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:
LINE 416: While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,
LINE 417: The knowing racer to his end proceeds;
LINE 418: Fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,
LINE 419: His hand unerring steers the steady horse,
LINE 420: And now contracts, or now extends the rein,
LINE 421: Observing still the foremost on the plain.
LINE 422: Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;
LINE 423: Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;
LINE 424: Of some once stately oak the last remains,
LINE 425: Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:
LINE 426: Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;
LINE 427: And round, a circle for the wheeling car.
LINE 428: (Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;
LINE 429: Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)
LINE 430: Bear close to this, and warily proceed,
LINE 431: A little bending to the left-hand steed;
LINE 432: But urge the right, and give him all the reins;
LINE 433: While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,
LINE 434: And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,
LINE 435: The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.
LINE 436: Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)
LINE 437: Clear of the stony heap direct the course;
LINE 438: Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be
LINE 439: A joy to others, a reproach to me.
LINE 440: So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,
LINE 441: And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:
LINE 442: Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
LINE 443: Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;
LINE 444: Or the famed race, through all the regions known,
LINE 445: That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."
LINE 446: Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage
LINE 447: Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.
LINE 448: Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,
LINE 449: The last, but not least ardent for the prize.
LINE 450: They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose
LINE 451: (Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).
LINE 452: Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;
LINE 453: And next the brother of the king of men:
LINE 454: Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;
LINE 455: And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.
LINE 456: They stand in order, an impatient train:
LINE 457: Pelides points the barrier on the plain,
LINE 458: And sends before old Phœnix to the place,
LINE 459: To mark the racers, and to judge the race.
LINE 460: At once the coursers from the barrier bound;
LINE 461: The lifted scourges all at once resound;
LINE 462: Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;
LINE 463: And up the champaign thunder from the shore:
LINE 464: Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,
LINE 465: And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;
LINE 466: Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,
LINE 467: Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:
LINE 468: The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,
LINE 469: Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.
LINE 470: While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,
LINE 471: (Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)
LINE 472: Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,
LINE 473: They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.
LINE 474: Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)
LINE 475: At the near prize each gathers all his soul,
LINE 476: Each burns with double hope, with double pain,
LINE 477: Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
LINE 478: First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;
LINE 479: With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:
LINE 480: Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,
LINE 481: And seem just mounting on his car behind;
LINE 482: Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
LINE 483: And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.
LINE 484: Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;
LINE 485: But angry Phœbus to Tydides flies,
LINE 486: Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain
LINE 487: His matchless horses' labour on the plain.
LINE 488: Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey
LINE 489: Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.
LINE 490: The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,
LINE 491: Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,
LINE 492: And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke
LINE 493: She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:
LINE 494: No more their way the startled horses held;
LINE 495: The car reversed came rattling on the field;
LINE 496: Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,
LINE 497: Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;
LINE 498: His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;
LINE 499: Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:
LINE 500: Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:
LINE 501: Before him far the glad Tydides flies;
LINE 502: Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,
LINE 503: And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.
LINE 504: The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;
LINE 505: While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:
LINE 506: "Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;
LINE 507: Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,
LINE 508: Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,
LINE 509: And gives their lord the honours of the day;
LINE 510: But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo
LINE 511: Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?
LINE 512: Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain
LINE 513: The last ignoble gift be all we gain,
LINE 514: No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,
LINE 515: The old man's fury rises, and ye die.
LINE 516: Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,
LINE 517: Presents the occasion, could we use it right."
LINE 518: Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat
LINE 519: With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
LINE 520: And now Antilochus with nice survey
LINE 521: Observes the compass of the hollow way.
LINE 522: 'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,
LINE 523: Fast by the road a precipice was worn:
LINE 524: Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng
LINE 525: The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.
LINE 526: Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,
LINE 527: Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.
LINE 528: Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,
LINE 529: And wonders at the rashness of his foe.
LINE 530: "Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride
LINE 531: This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),
LINE 532: Or both must fall."—Atrides cried in vain;
LINE 533: He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
LINE 534: Far as an able arm the disk can send,
LINE 535: When youthful rivals their full force extend,
LINE 536: So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew
LINE 537: Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew
LINE 538: His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears
LINE 539: The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,
LINE 540: The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,
LINE 541: And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
LINE 542: But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:
LINE 543: "Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!
LINE 544: Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;
LINE 545: Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—"
LINE 546: Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,
LINE 547: "Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!
LINE 548: Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,
LINE 549: With fainting knees shall labour in the course,
LINE 550: And yield the glory yours."—The steeds obey;
LINE 551: Already at their heels they wing their way,
LINE 552: And seem already to retrieve the day.
LINE 553: Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
LINE 554: The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.
LINE 555: The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;
LINE 556: High on a rising ground, above the ring,
LINE 557: The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey
LINE 558: He well observed the chief who led the way,
LINE 559: And heard from far his animating cries,
LINE 560: And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;
LINE 561: On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,
LINE 562: Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.
LINE 563: He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:
LINE 564: "Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?
LINE 565: Or can ye, all, another chief survey,
LINE 566: And other steeds than lately led the way?
LINE 567: Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,
LINE 568: Lie sure disabled in the middle field:
LINE 569: For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain
LINE 570: I search to find them, but I search in vain.
LINE 571: Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,
LINE 572: And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,
LINE 573: Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray
LINE 574: With frantic fury from the destined way.
LINE 575: Rise then some other, and inform my sight,
LINE 576: For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;
LINE 577: Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,
LINE 578: The great Ætolian chief, renown'd in war."
LINE 579: "Old man! (Oïleus rashly thus replies)
LINE 580: Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;
LINE 581: Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,
LINE 582: Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.
LINE 583: Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,
LINE 584: Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:
LINE 585: I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,
LINE 586: And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."
LINE 587: Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:
LINE 588: "Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!
LINE 589: Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside
LINE 590: The last in merit, as the first in pride!
LINE 591: To vile reproach what answer can we make?
LINE 592: A goblet or a tripod let us stake,
LINE 593: And be the king the judge. The most unwise
LINE 594: Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."
LINE 595: He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,
LINE 596: Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn
LINE 597: To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son
LINE 598: Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:
LINE 599: "Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;
LINE 600: Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:
LINE 601: And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."
LINE 602: No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,
LINE 603: Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.
LINE 604: High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:
LINE 605: His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:
LINE 606: His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,
LINE 607: Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,
LINE 608: Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find
LINE 609: The track his flying wheels had left behind:
LINE 610: And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace
LINE 611: So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.
LINE 612: Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,
LINE 613: Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;
LINE 614: From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;
LINE 615: The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:
LINE 616: With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,
LINE 617: The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:
LINE 618: These to the ships his train triumphant leads,
LINE 619: The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.
LINE 620: Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,
LINE 621: O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.
LINE 622: Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near
LINE 623: Than to the courser in his swift career
LINE 624: The following car, just touching with his heel
LINE 625: And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:
LINE 626: Such, and so narrow now the space between
LINE 627: The rivals, late so distant on the green;
LINE 628: So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain'd,
LINE 629: One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.
LINE 630: Merion pursued, at greater distance still,
LINE 631: With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.
LINE 632: Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;
LINE 633: Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:
LINE 634: Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:
LINE 635: "Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd
LINE 636: The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!
LINE 637: Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay
LINE 638: (Since great Tydides bears the first away)
LINE 639: To him the second honours of the day."
LINE 640: The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,
LINE 641: And then Eumelus had received the prize,
LINE 642: But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,
LINE 643: The award opposes, and asserts his claim.
LINE 644: "Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,
LINE 645: O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.
LINE 646: What if the gods, the skilful to confound,
LINE 647: Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?
LINE 648: Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,
LINE 649: And vows omitted forfeited the prize.
LINE 650: If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,
LINE 651: And please a soul desirous to bestow)
LINE 652: Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store
LINE 653: Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;
LINE 654: An ample present let him thence receive,
LINE 655: And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.
LINE 656: But this my prize I never shall forego;
LINE 657: This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."
LINE 658: Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;
LINE 659: Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,
LINE 660: Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),
LINE 661: Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.
LINE 662: With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,
LINE 663: (The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)
LINE 664: Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,
LINE 665: (No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."
LINE 666: He said: Automedon at his command
LINE 667: The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.
LINE 668: Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows
LINE 669: With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;
LINE 670: The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,
LINE 671: And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.
LINE 672: Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,
LINE 673: And inly grieving, thus the king begun:
LINE 674: "The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,
LINE 675: An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.
LINE 676: Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,
LINE 677: To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:
LINE 678: So not a leader shall our conduct blame,
LINE 679: Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.
LINE 680: But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?
LINE 681: What needs appealing in a fact so plain?
LINE 682: What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,
LINE 683: And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?
LINE 684: Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,
LINE 685: The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;
LINE 686: And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent
LINE 687: Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.
LINE 688: Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround
LINE 689: The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"
LINE 690: The prudent chief with calm attention heard;
LINE 691: Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;
LINE 692: Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,
LINE 693: Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.
LINE 694: Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,
LINE 695: Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.
LINE 696: The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;
LINE 697: The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine
LINE 698: Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)
LINE 699: Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."
LINE 700: So spoke Antilochus; and at the word
LINE 701: The mare contested to the king restored.
LINE 702: Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain
LINE 703: Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,
LINE 704: The fields their vegetable life renew,
LINE 705: And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;
LINE 706: Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,
LINE 707: And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:
LINE 708: "Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree
LINE 709: 'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.
LINE 710: Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,
LINE 711: Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.
LINE 712: Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way
LINE 713: To waive contention with superior sway;
LINE 714: For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,
LINE 715: Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!
LINE 716: To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,
LINE 717: Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:
LINE 718: Generous alike, for me, the sire and son
LINE 719: Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.
LINE 720: I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,
LINE 721: Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend."
LINE 722: He said; and pleased his passion to command,
LINE 723: Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,
LINE 724: Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,
LINE 725: The shining charger to his vessel sent.
LINE 726: The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;
LINE 727: The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.
LINE 728: Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.
LINE 729: And thus the purpose of his gift declares:
LINE 730: "Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)
LINE 731: In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;
LINE 732: Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,
LINE 733: For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!
LINE 734: Take thou this token of a grateful heart,
LINE 735: Though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,
LINE 736: The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,
LINE 737: Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:
LINE 738: Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,
LINE 739: But left the glory of the past thy own."
LINE 740: He said, and placed the goblet at his side;
LINE 741: With joy the venerable king replied:
LINE 742: "Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved
LINE 743: A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!
LINE 744: Too true it is, deserted of my strength,
LINE 745: These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.
LINE 746: Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,
LINE 747: Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!
LINE 748: Victorious then in every solemn game,
LINE 749: Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;
LINE 750: The brave Epeians gave my glory way,
LINE 751: Ætolians, Pylians, all resign'd the day.
LINE 752: I quell'd Clytomedes in fights of hand,
LINE 753: And backward hurl'd Ancæus on the sand,
LINE 754: Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,
LINE 755: Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.
LINE 756: The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,
LINE 757: But won by numbers, not by art or force:
LINE 758: For the famed twins, impatient to survey
LINE 759: Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,
LINE 760: Sprung to their car; and with united pains
LINE 761: One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.
LINE 762: Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds
LINE 763: A younger race, that emulate our deeds:
LINE 764: I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)
LINE 765: Though once the foremost hero of the field.
LINE 766: Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,
LINE 767: With martial honours decorate the dead:
LINE 768: While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,
LINE 769: (Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)
LINE 770: Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see
LINE 771: Not one but honours sacred age and me:
LINE 772: Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,
LINE 773: May the just gods return another day!"
LINE 774: Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:
LINE 775: Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.
LINE 776: The prizes next are order'd to the field,
LINE 777: For the bold champions who the caestus wield.
LINE 778: A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,
LINE 779: Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,
LINE 780: Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;
LINE 781: Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.
LINE 782: Achilles rising, thus: "Let Greece excite
LINE 783: Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;
LINE 784: Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,
LINE 785: And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.
LINE 786: On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,
LINE 787: And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,
LINE 788: This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,
LINE 789: The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away."
LINE 790: This dreadful combat great Epeüs chose;[291]
LINE 791: High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,
LINE 792: And seized the beast, and thus began to say:
LINE 793: "Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!
LINE 794: (Price of his ruin: for who dares deny
LINE 795: This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)
LINE 796: Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,
LINE 797: But the first honours of this fight are mine;
LINE 798: For who excels in all? Then let my foe
LINE 799: Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;
LINE 800: Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,
LINE 801: Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:
LINE 802: So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,
LINE 803: To heave the batter'd carcase off the plain."
LINE 804: The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze
LINE 805: The host beheld him, silent with amaze!
LINE 806: 'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire
LINE 807: To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,
LINE 808: The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore
LINE 809: In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,
LINE 810: (The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)
LINE 811: And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.
LINE 812: Him great Tydides urges to contend,
LINE 813: Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;
LINE 814: Officious with the cincture girds him round;
LINE 815: And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.
LINE 816: Amid the circle now each champion stands,
LINE 817: And poises high in air his iron hands;
LINE 818: With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,
LINE 819: Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,
LINE 820: And painful sweat from all their members flows.
LINE 821: At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow
LINE 822: Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;
LINE 823: Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway
LINE 824: Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.
LINE 825: As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,
LINE 826: By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,
LINE 827: Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,
LINE 828: The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
LINE 829: To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,
LINE 830: Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;
LINE 831: Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,
LINE 832: And dragging his disabled legs along;
LINE 833: Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;
LINE 834: His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]
LINE 835: Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;
LINE 836: His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.
LINE 837: The third bold game Achilles next demands,
LINE 838: And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:
LINE 839: A massy tripod for the victor lies,
LINE 840: Of twice six oxen its reputed price;
LINE 841: And next, the loser's spirits to restore,
LINE 842: A female captive, valued but at four.
LINE 843: Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose
LINE 844: When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.
LINE 845: Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,
LINE 846: Embracing rigid with implicit hands.
LINE 847: Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:
LINE 848: Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;
LINE 849: Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,
LINE 850: Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,
LINE 851: Their tops connected, but at wider space
LINE 852: Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.
LINE 853: Now to the grasp each manly body bends;
LINE 854: The humid sweat from every pore descends;
LINE 855: Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs
LINE 856: Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.
LINE 857: Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,
LINE 858: O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;
LINE 859: Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow
LINE 860: The watchful caution of his artful foe.
LINE 861: While the long strife even tired the lookers on,
LINE 862: Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:
LINE 863: "Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:
LINE 864: Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree."
LINE 865: He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground
LINE 866: With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found
LINE 867: The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine
LINE 868: His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;
LINE 869: Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;
LINE 870: Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
LINE 871: Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;
LINE 872: He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:
LINE 873: His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;
LINE 874: And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.
LINE 875: Defiled with honourable dust they roll,
LINE 876: Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:
LINE 877: Again they rage, again to combat rise;
LINE 878: When great Achilles thus divides the prize:
LINE 879: "Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;
LINE 880: Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
LINE 881: Ye both have won: let others who excel,
LINE 882: Now prove that prowess you have proved so well."
LINE 883: The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,
LINE 884: From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,
LINE 885: And, clothed anew, the following games survey.
LINE 886: And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace
LINE 887: The youths contending in the rapid race:
LINE 888: A silver urn that full six measures held,
LINE 889: By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:
LINE 890: Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,
LINE 891: Elaborate, with artifice divine;
LINE 892: Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,
LINE 893: And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:
LINE 894: From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd
LINE 895: The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,
LINE 896: To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:
LINE 897: Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,
LINE 898: It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
LINE 899: A well-fed ox was for the second placed;
LINE 900: And half a talent must content the last.
LINE 901: Achilles rising then bespoke the train:
LINE 902: "Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,
LINE 903: Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."
LINE 904: The hero said, and starting from his place,
LINE 905: Oilean Ajax rises to the race;
LINE 906: Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd
LINE 907: His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.
LINE 908: Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;
LINE 909: Pelides points the barrier with his hand;
LINE 910: All start at once; Oïleus led the race;
LINE 911: The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;
LINE 912: Behind him, diligently close, he sped,
LINE 913: As closely following as the running thread
LINE 914: The spindle follows, and displays the charms
LINE 915: Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:
LINE 916: Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,
LINE 917: And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;
LINE 918: His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:
LINE 919: The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:
LINE 920: To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,
LINE 921: And send their souls before him as he flies.
LINE 922: Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,
LINE 923: The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:
LINE 924: "Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!
LINE 925: And present at his thought descends the maid.
LINE 926: Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,
LINE 927: And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
LINE 928: All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,
LINE 929: Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain
LINE 930: (O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore
LINE 931: Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.
LINE 932: (The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,
LINE 933: Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)
LINE 934: Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,
LINE 935: Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;
LINE 936: The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,
LINE 937: And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.
LINE 938: Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,
LINE 939: The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:
LINE 940: "Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;
LINE 941: A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;
LINE 942: She urged her favourite on the rapid way,
LINE 943: And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."
LINE 944: Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;
LINE 945: A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.
LINE 946: Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,
LINE 947: Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:
LINE 948: "Why with our wiser elders should we strive?
LINE 949: The gods still love them, and they always thrive.
LINE 950: Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:
LINE 951: He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;
LINE 952: (A green old age unconscious of decays,
LINE 953: That proves the hero born in better days!)
LINE 954: Behold his vigour in this active race!
LINE 955: Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:
LINE 956: For who can match Achilles? He who can,
LINE 957: Must yet be more than hero, more than man."
LINE 958: The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,
LINE 959: "Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.
LINE 960: Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;
LINE 961: Receive a talent of the purest gold."
LINE 962: The youth departs content. The host admire
LINE 963: The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.
LINE 964: Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;
LINE 965: Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:
LINE 966: Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,
LINE 967: And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.
LINE 968: "Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)
LINE 969: Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,
LINE 970: Now grace the lists before our army's sight,
LINE 971: And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.
LINE 972: Who first the jointed armour shall explore,
LINE 973: And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,
LINE 974: The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,
LINE 975: (A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)
LINE 976: Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:
LINE 977: These arms in common let the chiefs divide:
LINE 978: For each brave champion, when the combat ends,
LINE 979: A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends."
LINE 980: Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,
LINE 981: And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.
LINE 982: Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,
LINE 983: The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;
LINE 984: Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;
LINE 985: Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.
LINE 986: Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,
LINE 987: But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.
LINE 988: A furious pass the spear of Ajax made
LINE 989: Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.
LINE 990: Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above
LINE 991: The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.
LINE 992: But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,
LINE 993: Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.
LINE 994: Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,
LINE 995: With him the sword and studded belt remains.
LINE 996: Then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,
LINE 997: A mass of iron (an enormous round),
LINE 998: Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,
LINE 999: Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.
LINE 1000: This mighty quoit Aëtion wont to rear,
LINE 1001: And from his whirling arm dismiss in air;
LINE 1002: The giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd
LINE 1003: Among his spoils this memorable load.
LINE 1004: For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,
LINE 1005: That teach the disk to sound along the sky.
LINE 1006: "Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;
LINE 1007: Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;
LINE 1008: If he be one enrich'd with large domain
LINE 1009: Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,
LINE 1010: Small stock of iron needs that man provide;
LINE 1011: His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied
LINE 1012: From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid
LINE 1013: For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade."
LINE 1014: Stern Polypœtes stepp'd before the throng,
LINE 1015: And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;
LINE 1016: Whose force with rival forces to oppose,
LINE 1017: Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.
LINE 1018: Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;
LINE 1019: High o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.
LINE 1020: Leonteus next a little space surpass'd;
LINE 1021: And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.
LINE 1022: O'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung
LINE 1023: From Polypœtes' arm the discus sung:
LINE 1024: Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,
LINE 1025: That distant falls among the grazing cows,
LINE 1026: So past them all the rapid circle flies:
LINE 1027: His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,
LINE 1028: With force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.
LINE 1029: Those, who in skilful archery contend,
LINE 1030: He next invites the twanging bow to bend;
LINE 1031: And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,
LINE 1032: Ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound
LINE 1033: The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,
LINE 1034: The hero fixes in the sandy shore;
LINE 1035: To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,
LINE 1036: The trembling mark at which their arrows fly.
LINE 1037: "Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear
LINE 1038: These two-edged axes, terrible in war;
LINE 1039: The single, he whose shaft divides the cord."
LINE 1040: He said: experienced Merion took the word;
LINE 1041: And skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw
LINE 1042: Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.
LINE 1043: Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;
LINE 1044: But flies unbless'd! No grateful sacrifice,
LINE 1045: No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow
LINE 1046: To Phœbus, patron of the shaft and bow.
LINE 1047: For this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,
LINE 1048: Err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:
LINE 1049: Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,
LINE 1050: And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:
LINE 1051: Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,
LINE 1052: And Merion eager meditates the wound:
LINE 1053: He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,
LINE 1054: And following with his eye the soaring dove,
LINE 1055: Implores the god to speed it through the skies,
LINE 1056: With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice,
LINE 1057: The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,
LINE 1058: Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;
LINE 1059: Quite through and through the point its passage found,
LINE 1060: And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.
LINE 1061: The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,
LINE 1062: With flagging wings alighted on the mast,
LINE 1063: A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,
LINE 1064: Then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.
LINE 1065: From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,
LINE 1066: And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.
LINE 1067: To close the funeral games, Achilles last
LINE 1068: A massy spear amid the circle placed,
LINE 1069: And ample charger of unsullied frame,
LINE 1070: With flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.
LINE 1071: For these he bids the heroes prove their art,
LINE 1072: Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.
LINE 1073: Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;
LINE 1074: Nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.
LINE 1075: With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,
LINE 1076: Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:
LINE 1077: "Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,
LINE 1078: O king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;
LINE 1079: In every martial game thy worth attest,
LINE 1080: And know thee both their greatest and their best.
LINE 1081: Take then the prize, but let brave Merion bear
LINE 1082: This beamy javelin in thy brother's war."
LINE 1083: Pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,
LINE 1084: The king to Merion gives the brazen spear:
LINE 1085: But, set apart for sacred use, commands
LINE 1086: The glittering charger to Talthybius' hands.
