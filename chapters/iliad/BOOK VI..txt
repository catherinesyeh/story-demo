LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.
LINE 3: The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the
LINE 4: chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to
LINE 5: appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the
LINE 6: temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The
LINE 7: battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have
LINE 8: an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of
LINE 9: the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they
LINE 10: make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of
LINE 11: Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a
LINE 12: tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.
LINE 13: The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers
LINE 14: Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.
LINE 15: Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield
LINE 16: To human force and human skill the field:
LINE 17: Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;
LINE 18: Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;
LINE 19: While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain
LINE 20: On either side, run purple to the main.
LINE 21: Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,
LINE 22: Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.
LINE 23: The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,
LINE 24: And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;
LINE 25: His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd
LINE 26: Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;
LINE 27: Fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,
LINE 28: And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.
LINE 29: Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,
LINE 30: Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:
LINE 31: In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)[161]
LINE 32: He held his seat! a friend to human race.
LINE 33: Fast by the road, his ever-open door
LINE 34: Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
LINE 35: To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,
LINE 36: No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!
LINE 37: Breathless the good man fell, and by his side
LINE 38: His faithful servant, old Calesius died.
LINE 39: By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,
LINE 40: And next he laid Opheltius on the plain.
LINE 41: Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,
LINE 42: From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:
LINE 43: (Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,
LINE 44: That monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;
LINE 45: In secret woods he won the naiad's grace,
LINE 46: And two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)
LINE 47: Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;
LINE 48: The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.
LINE 49: Astyalus by Polypœtes fell;
LINE 50: Ulysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;
LINE 51: By Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,
LINE 52: And Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;
LINE 53: Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,
LINE 54: The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,
LINE 55: Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,[162]
LINE 56: And till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.
LINE 57: Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;
LINE 58: And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.
LINE 59: Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies
LINE 60: Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.
LINE 61: Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,
LINE 62: His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,
LINE 63: Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke
LINE 64: The shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;
LINE 65: Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,
LINE 66: For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.
LINE 67: Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:
LINE 68: Atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;
LINE 69: The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd
LINE 70: The victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:
LINE 71: "O spare my youth, and for the life I owe
LINE 72: Large gifts of price my father shall bestow.
LINE 73: When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,
LINE 74: Thy hollow ships his captive son detain:
LINE 75: Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,[163]
LINE 76: And steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold."
LINE 77: He said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart
LINE 78: He stood, suspended with the lifted dart:
LINE 79: As pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,
LINE 80: Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,
LINE 81: And, furious, thus: "Oh impotent of mind![164]
LINE 82: Shall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?
LINE 83: Well hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,
LINE 84: And well her natives merit at thy hand!
LINE 85: Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,
LINE 86: Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:
LINE 87: Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all;
LINE 88: Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;[165]
LINE 89: A dreadful lesson of exampled fate,
LINE 90: To warn the nations, and to curb the great!"
LINE 91: The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,
LINE 92: To rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast.
LINE 93: Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;
LINE 94: The monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,
LINE 95: Then pressing with his foot his panting heart,
LINE 96: Forth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.
LINE 97: Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;
LINE 98: "Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;
LINE 99: No son of Mars descend, for servile gains,
LINE 100: To touch the booty, while a foe remains.
LINE 101: Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!
LINE 102: First gain the conquest, then reward the toil."
LINE 103: And now had Greece eternal fame acquired,
LINE 104: And frighted Troy within her walls, retired,
LINE 105: Had not sage Helenus her state redress'd,
LINE 106: Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.
LINE 107: Where Hector stood, with great Æneas join'd,
LINE 108: The seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:
LINE 109: "Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay
LINE 110: The cares and glories of this doubtful day;
LINE 111: On whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;
LINE 112: Wise to consult, and active to defend!
LINE 113: Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,
LINE 114: Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,
LINE 115: Ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,
LINE 116: The sport and insult of the hostile train.
LINE 117: When your commands have hearten'd every band,
LINE 118: Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;
LINE 119: Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,
LINE 120: These straits demand our last remains of might.
LINE 121: Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,
LINE 122: And teach our mother what the gods require:
LINE 123: Direct the queen to lead the assembled train
LINE 124: Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;[166]
LINE 125: Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,
LINE 126: With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.
LINE 127: The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,
LINE 128: Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
LINE 129: Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
LINE 130: And twelve young heifers to her altars led:
LINE 131: If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
LINE 132: Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,
LINE 133: And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,
LINE 134: That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;
LINE 135: Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,
LINE 136: Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;
LINE 137: Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,
LINE 138: In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might."
LINE 139: Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,
LINE 140: Leap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;
LINE 141: Through all his host inspiring force he flies,
LINE 142: And bids the thunder of the battle rise.
LINE 143: With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,
LINE 144: And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:
LINE 145: Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;
LINE 146: All Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;
LINE 147: Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,
LINE 148: Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.
LINE 149: Then thus aloud: "Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!
LINE 150: And you whom distant nations send to war!
LINE 151: Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;
LINE 152: Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.
LINE 153: One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,
LINE 154: To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:
LINE 155: Nor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,
LINE 156: And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain."
LINE 157: This said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;
LINE 158: The shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,
LINE 159: His neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;
LINE 160: And as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.
LINE 161: Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]
LINE 162: Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son
LINE 163: Between both armies met: the chiefs from far
LINE 164: Observed each other, and had mark'd for war.
LINE 165: Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:
LINE 166: "What art thou, boldest of the race of man?
LINE 167: Our eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,
LINE 168: Where fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;
LINE 169: Yet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,
LINE 170: And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.
LINE 171: Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,
LINE 172: Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!
LINE 173: But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,
LINE 174: Know with immortals we no more contend.
LINE 175: Not long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,
LINE 176: That daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.
LINE 177: Bacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,
LINE 178: With brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:
LINE 179: Their consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,
LINE 180: With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;
LINE 181: While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,
LINE 182: And Thetis' arms received the trembling god.
LINE 183: Nor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;
LINE 184: (The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)
LINE 185: Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,
LINE 186: Cheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,
LINE 187: Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,
LINE 188: A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!
LINE 189: I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth
LINE 190: Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,
LINE 191: Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,
LINE 192: Approach, and enter the dark gates of death."
LINE 193: "What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,
LINE 194: (Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?
LINE 195: Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,
LINE 196: Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;
LINE 197: Another race the following spring supplies;
LINE 198: They fall successive, and successive rise:
LINE 199: So generations in their course decay;
LINE 200: So flourish these, when those are pass'd away.
LINE 201: But if thou still persist to search my birth,
LINE 202: Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.
LINE 203: "A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,
LINE 204: (Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)
LINE 205: Æolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,
LINE 206: In ancient time the happy wall possess'd,
LINE 207: Then call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;
LINE 208: Great Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,
LINE 209: Who o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,
LINE 210: Loved for that valour which preserves mankind.
LINE 211: Then mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,
LINE 212: Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.
LINE 213: With direful jealousy the monarch raged,
LINE 214: And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.
LINE 215: For him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,
LINE 216: And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:
LINE 217: In vain she tempted the relentless youth,
LINE 218: Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.
LINE 219: Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,
LINE 220: And begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:
LINE 221: Incensed he heard, resolving on his fate;
LINE 222: But hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:
LINE 223: To Lycia the devoted youth he sent,
LINE 224: With tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.[168]
LINE 225: Now bless'd by every power who guards the good,
LINE 226: The chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:
LINE 227: There Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,
LINE 228: Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.
LINE 229: But when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,
LINE 230: The faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:
LINE 231: The fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,
LINE 232: The deathful secret to the king reveal'd.
LINE 233: First, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;
LINE 234: A mingled monster of no mortal kind!
LINE 235: Behind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;
LINE 236: A goat's rough body bore a lion's head;
LINE 237: Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;
LINE 238: Her gaping throat emits infernal fire.
LINE 239: "This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,
LINE 240: And trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)
LINE 241: Then met in arms the Solymæan crew,[169]
LINE 242: (Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;
LINE 243: Next the bold Amazons' whole force defied;
LINE 244: And conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.
LINE 245: "Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,
LINE 246: At his return, a treacherous ambush rose,
LINE 247: With levell'd spears along the winding shore:
LINE 248: There fell they breathless, and return'd no more.
LINE 249: "At length the monarch, with repentant grief,
LINE 250: Confess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;
LINE 251: His daughter gave, the stranger to detain,
LINE 252: With half the honours of his ample reign:
LINE 253: The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,
LINE 254: With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.
LINE 255: There long the chief his happy lot possess'd,
LINE 256: With two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;
LINE 257: (Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love
LINE 258: Crown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)
LINE 259: But when at last, distracted in his mind,
LINE 260: Forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,
LINE 261: Wide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,
LINE 262: A long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]
LINE 263: Woes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:
LINE 264: His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;
LINE 265: His eldest born by raging Mars was slain,
LINE 266: In combat on the Solymaean plain.
LINE 267: Hippolochus survived: from him I came,
LINE 268: The honour'd author of my birth and name;
LINE 269: By his decree I sought the Trojan town;
LINE 270: By his instructions learn to win renown,
LINE 271: To stand the first in worth as in command,
LINE 272: To add new honours to my native land,
LINE 273: Before my eyes my mighty sires to place,
LINE 274: And emulate the glories of our race."
LINE 275: He spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;
LINE 276: In earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,
LINE 277: Then friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:
LINE 278: "Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!
LINE 279: Thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,
LINE 280: Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race.
LINE 281: Know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;
LINE 282: Œneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:
LINE 283: Our ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,
LINE 284: Where twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.
LINE 285: The parting heroes mutual presents left;
LINE 286: A golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;
LINE 287: Œneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,
LINE 288: That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.
LINE 289: (This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored
LINE 290: Among my treasures, still adorns my board:
LINE 291: For Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall
LINE 292: Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)
LINE 293: Mindful of this, in friendship let us join;
LINE 294: If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,
LINE 295: My guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.
LINE 296: Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,
LINE 297: In the full harvest of yon ample field;
LINE 298: Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;
LINE 299: But thou and Diomed be foes no more.
LINE 300: Now change we arms, and prove to either host
LINE 301: We guard the friendship of the line we boast."
LINE 302: Thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,
LINE 303: Their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;
LINE 304: Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,
LINE 305: (Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)
LINE 306: For Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,
LINE 307: For which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)
LINE 308: He gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]
LINE 309: A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.
LINE 310: Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state,
LINE 311: Great Hector, enter'd at the Scæan gate.[172]
LINE 312: Beneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,
LINE 313: The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids
LINE 314: Around him flock'd, all press'd with pious care
LINE 315: For husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.
LINE 316: He bids the train in long procession go,
LINE 317: And seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.
LINE 318: And now to Priam's stately courts he came,
LINE 319: Rais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;
LINE 320: O'er these a range of marble structure runs,
LINE 321: The rich pavilions of his fifty sons,
LINE 322: In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]
LINE 323: Opposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.
LINE 324: Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,
LINE 325: Of equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.
LINE 326: Hither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen
LINE 327: Of royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.
LINE 328: (With her Laodice, whose beauteous face
LINE 329: Surpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)
LINE 330: Long in a strict embrace she held her son,
LINE 331: And press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:
LINE 332: "O Hector! say, what great occasion calls
LINE 333: My son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;
LINE 334: Com'st thou to supplicate the almighty power
LINE 335: With lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?
LINE 336: Stay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,
LINE 337: In Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,
LINE 338: And pay due vows to all the gods around.
LINE 339: Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,
LINE 340: And draw new spirits from the generous bowl;
LINE 341: Spent as thou art with long laborious fight,
LINE 342: The brave defender of thy country's right."
LINE 343: "Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)
LINE 344: Inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,
LINE 345: Unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.
LINE 346: Let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice
LINE 347: To sprinkle to the gods, its better use.
LINE 348: By me that holy office were profaned;
LINE 349: Ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,
LINE 350: To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,
LINE 351: Or offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.
LINE 352: You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,
LINE 353: And burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.
LINE 354: The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,
LINE 355: Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
LINE 356: Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
LINE 357: And twelve young heifers to her altar led.
LINE 358: So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
LINE 359: Our wives, our infants, and our city spare;
LINE 360: And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,
LINE 361: Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.
LINE 362: Be this, O mother, your religious care:
LINE 363: I go to rouse soft Paris to the war;
LINE 364: If yet not lost to all the sense of shame,
LINE 365: The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.
LINE 366: Oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,
LINE 367: That pest of Troy, that ruin of our race![174]
LINE 368: Deep to the dark abyss might he descend,
LINE 369: Troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end."
LINE 370: This heard, she gave command: and summon'd came
LINE 371: Each noble matron and illustrious dame.
LINE 372: The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,
LINE 373: Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.
LINE 374: There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,
LINE 375: Sidonian maids embroider'd every part,
LINE 376: Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,
LINE 377: With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.
LINE 378: Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes
LINE 379: The various textures and the various dyes,
LINE 380: She chose a veil that shone superior far,
LINE 381: And glow'd refulgent as the morning star.
LINE 382: Herself with this the long procession leads;
LINE 383: The train majestically slow proceeds.
LINE 384: Soon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,
LINE 385: And awful reach the high Palladian dome,
LINE 386: Antenor's consort, fair Theano, waits
LINE 387: As Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.
LINE 388: With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,
LINE 389: They fill the dome with supplicating cries.
LINE 390: The priestess then the shining veil displays,
LINE 391: Placed on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:
LINE 392: "Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,
LINE 393: Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!
LINE 394: Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall
LINE 395: Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!
LINE 396: So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,
LINE 397: Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.
LINE 398: But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,
LINE 399: Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!"
LINE 400: So pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;
LINE 401: So vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.
LINE 402: While these appear before the power with prayers,
LINE 403: Hector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.[175]
LINE 404: Himself the mansion raised, from every part
LINE 405: Assembling architects of matchless art.
LINE 406: Near Priam's court and Hector's palace stands
LINE 407: The pompous structure, and the town commands.
LINE 408: A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,
LINE 409: Of full ten cubits was the lance's length,
LINE 410: The steely point with golden ringlets join'd,
LINE 411: Before him brandish'd, at each motion shined
LINE 412: Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found
LINE 413: His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,
LINE 414: His eyes delighting with their splendid show,
LINE 415: Brightening the shield, and polishing the bow.
LINE 416: Beside him Helen with her virgins stands,
LINE 417: Guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.
LINE 418: Him thus inactive, with an ardent look
LINE 419: The prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.
LINE 420: "Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?
LINE 421: (O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)
LINE 422: Paris and Greece against us both conspire,
LINE 423: Thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.
LINE 424: For thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall,
LINE 425: Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall,
LINE 426: For thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,
LINE 427: And wasteful war in all its fury burns.
LINE 428: Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care,
LINE 429: Our troops to hearten, and our toils to share?
LINE 430: Rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,
LINE 431: And all the Phrygian glories at an end."
LINE 432: "Brother, 'tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)
LINE 433: Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:
LINE 434: Yet charge my absence less, O generous chief!
LINE 435: On hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:
LINE 436: Here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,
LINE 437: And mourn'd, in secret, his and Ilion's fate.
LINE 438: 'Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,
LINE 439: And beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.
LINE 440: Conquest to-day my happier sword may bless,
LINE 441: 'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.
LINE 442: But while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;
LINE 443: Or go, and Paris shall not lag behind."
LINE 444: [Illustration: ] HECTOR CHIDING PARIS
LINE 445: He said, nor answer'd Priam's warlike son;
LINE 446: When Helen thus with lowly grace begun:
LINE 447: "Oh, generous brother! (if the guilty dame
LINE 448: That caused these woes deserve a sister's name!)
LINE 449: Would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,
LINE 450: The day that show'd me to the golden sun
LINE 451: Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear
LINE 452: The fatal infant to the fowls of air?
LINE 453: Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,
LINE 454: And midst the roarings of the waters died?
LINE 455: Heaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed
LINE 456: Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.
LINE 457: Helen at least a braver spouse might claim,
LINE 458: Warm'd with some virtue, some regard of fame!
LINE 459: Now tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline,
LINE 460: With toils, sustain'd for Paris' sake and mine
LINE 461: The gods have link'd our miserable doom,
LINE 462: Our present woe, and infamy to come:
LINE 463: Wide shall it spread, and last through ages long,
LINE 464: Example sad! and theme of future song."
LINE 465: The chief replied: "This time forbids to rest;
LINE 466: The Trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,
LINE 467: Demand their Hector, and his arm require;
LINE 468: The combat urges, and my soul's on fire.
LINE 469: Urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls,
LINE 470: And timely join me, ere I leave the walls.
LINE 471: Ere yet I mingle in the direful fray,
LINE 472: My wife, my infant, claim a moment's stay;
LINE 473: This day (perhaps the last that sees me here)
LINE 474: Demands a parting word, a tender tear:
LINE 475: This day, some god who hates our Trojan land
LINE 476: May vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand."
LINE 477: He said, and pass'd with sad presaging heart
LINE 478: To seek his spouse, his soul's far dearer part;
LINE 479: At home he sought her, but he sought in vain;
LINE 480: She, with one maid of all her menial train,
LINE 481: Had hence retired; and with her second joy,
LINE 482: The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy,
LINE 483: Pensive she stood on Ilion's towery height,
LINE 484: Beheld the war, and sicken'd at the sight;
LINE 485: There her sad eyes in vain her lord explore,
LINE 486: Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.
LINE 487: But he who found not whom his soul desired,
LINE 488: Whose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,
LINE 489: Stood in the gates, and ask'd "what way she bent
LINE 490: Her parting step? If to the fane she went,
LINE 491: Where late the mourning matrons made resort;
LINE 492: Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?"
LINE 493: "Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)
LINE 494: Nor mix'd with matrons to Minerva's fane:
LINE 495: To Ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,
LINE 496: To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.
LINE 497: Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;
LINE 498: She heard, and trembled for her absent lord:
LINE 499: Distracted with surprise, she seem'd to fly,
LINE 500: Fear on her cheek, and sorrow in her eye.
LINE 501: The nurse attended with her infant boy,
LINE 502: The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy."
LINE 503: Hector this heard, return'd without delay;
LINE 504: Swift through the town he trod his former way,
LINE 505: Through streets of palaces, and walks of state;
LINE 506: And met the mourner at the Scæan gate.
LINE 507: With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.
LINE 508: His blameless wife, Aëtion's wealthy heir
LINE 509: (Cilician Thebe great Aëtion sway'd,
LINE 510: And Hippoplacus' wide extended shade):
LINE 511: The nurse stood near, in whose embraces press'd,
LINE 512: His only hope hung smiling at her breast,
LINE 513: Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn,
LINE 514: Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.
LINE 515: To this loved infant Hector gave the name
LINE 516: Scamandrius, from Scamander's honour'd stream;
LINE 517: Astyanax the Trojans call'd the boy,
LINE 518: From his great father, the defence of Troy.
LINE 519: Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd
LINE 520: To tender passions all his mighty mind;
LINE 521: His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,
LINE 522: Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;
LINE 523: Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,
LINE 524: And the big tear stood trembling in her eye.
LINE 525: [Illustration: ] THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE
LINE 526: "Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?
LINE 527: Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!
LINE 528: And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,
LINE 529: A widow I, a helpless orphan he?
LINE 530: For sure such courage length of life denies,
LINE 531: And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.
LINE 532: Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;
LINE 533: Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.
LINE 534: O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,
LINE 535: All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!
LINE 536: So shall my days in one sad tenor run,
LINE 537: And end with sorrows as they first begun.
LINE 538: No parent now remains my griefs to share,
LINE 539: No father's aid, no mother's tender care.
LINE 540: The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,
LINE 541: Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!
LINE 542: His fate compassion in the victor bred;
LINE 543: Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,
LINE 544: His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,
LINE 545: And laid him decent on the funeral pile;
LINE 546: Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,
LINE 547: The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,
LINE 548: Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
LINE 549: A barren shade, and in his honour grow.
LINE 550: "By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;
LINE 551: In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;
LINE 552: While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,
LINE 553: Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!
LINE 554: My mother lived to wear the victor's bands,
LINE 555: The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands:
LINE 556: Redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again
LINE 557: Her pleasing empire and her native plain,
LINE 558: When ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,
LINE 559: She fell a victim to Diana's bow.
LINE 560: "Yet while my Hector still survives, I see
LINE 561: My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:
LINE 562: Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all
LINE 563: Once more will perish, if my Hector fall,
LINE 564: Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:
LINE 565: Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!
LINE 566: That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,
LINE 567: Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;
LINE 568: Thou, from this tower defend the important post;
LINE 569: There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,
LINE 570: That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,
LINE 571: And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.
LINE 572: Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,
LINE 573: Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.
LINE 574: Let others in the field their arms employ,
LINE 575: But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy."
LINE 576: The chief replied: "That post shall be my care,
LINE 577: Not that alone, but all the works of war.
LINE 578: How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,
LINE 579: And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground
LINE 580: Attaint the lustre of my former name,
LINE 581: Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?
LINE 582: My early youth was bred to martial pains,
LINE 583: My soul impels me to the embattled plains!
LINE 584: Let me be foremost to defend the throne,
LINE 585: And guard my father's glories, and my own.
LINE 586: "Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!
LINE 587: (How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)
LINE 588: The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,
LINE 589: And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.
LINE 590: And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,
LINE 591: My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,
LINE 592: Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,
LINE 593: Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;
LINE 594: As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:
LINE 595: I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!
LINE 596: In Argive looms our battles to design,
LINE 597: And woes, of which so large a part was thine!
LINE 598: To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring
LINE 599: The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.
LINE 600: There while you groan beneath the load of life,
LINE 601: They cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'
LINE 602: Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,
LINE 603: Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.
LINE 604: The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,
LINE 605: A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!
LINE 606: May I lie cold before that dreadful day,
LINE 607: Press'd with a load of monumental clay!
LINE 608: Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,
LINE 609: Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep."
LINE 610: Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy
LINE 611: Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.
LINE 612: The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,
LINE 613: Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.
LINE 614: With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,
LINE 615: And Hector hasted to relieve his child,
LINE 616: The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,
LINE 617: And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;
LINE 618: Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,
LINE 619: Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:
LINE 620: "O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,
LINE 621: And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!
LINE 622: Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,
LINE 623: To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,
LINE 624: Against his country's foes the war to wage,
LINE 625: And rise the Hector of the future age!
LINE 626: So when triumphant from successful toils
LINE 627: Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,
LINE 628: Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,
LINE 629: And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'
LINE 630: While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,
LINE 631: His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy."
LINE 632: He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,
LINE 633: Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;
LINE 634: Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,
LINE 635: Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.
LINE 636: The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,
LINE 637: She mingled with a smile a tender tear.
LINE 638: The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,
LINE 639: And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:
LINE 640: "Andromache! my soul's far better part,
LINE 641: Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
LINE 642: No hostile hand can antedate my doom,
LINE 643: Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.
LINE 644: Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;
LINE 645: And such the hard condition of our birth:
LINE 646: No force can then resist, no flight can save,
LINE 647: All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.
LINE 648: No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home,
LINE 649: There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:
LINE 650: Me glory summons to the martial scene,
LINE 651: The field of combat is the sphere for men.
LINE 652: Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,
LINE 653: The first in danger as the first in fame."
LINE 654: Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes
LINE 655: His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.
LINE 656: His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,
LINE 657: Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye
LINE 658: That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,
LINE 659: Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.
LINE 660: There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,
LINE 661: Through all her train the soft infection ran;
LINE 662: The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,
LINE 663: And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.
LINE 664: But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,
LINE 665: Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.
LINE 666: In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,
LINE 667: Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.
LINE 668: The wanton courser thus with reins unbound[176]
LINE 669: Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;
LINE 670: Pamper'd and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,
LINE 671: And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;
LINE 672: His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;
LINE 673: His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies;
LINE 674: He snuffs the females in the distant plain,
LINE 675: And springs, exulting, to his fields again.
LINE 676: With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,
LINE 677: In arms refulgent as the god of day,
LINE 678: The son of Priam, glorying in his might,
LINE 679: Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.
LINE 680: And now, the warriors passing on the way,
LINE 681: The graceful Paris first excused his stay.
LINE 682: To whom the noble Hector thus replied:
LINE 683: "O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!
LINE 684: Thy power in war with justice none contest;
LINE 685: Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.
LINE 686: What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,
LINE 687: Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave!
LINE 688: My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,
LINE 689: And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.
LINE 690: Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,
LINE 691: For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.
LINE 692: These ills shall cease, whene'er by Jove's decree
LINE 693: We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:
LINE 694: While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,
LINE 695: And Greece indignant through her seas returns."
