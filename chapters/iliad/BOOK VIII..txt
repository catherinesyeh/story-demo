LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.
LINE 3: Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the
LINE 4: pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of
LINE 5: him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join
LINE 6: battle: Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both,
LINE 7: and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone
LINE 8: continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him; whose
LINE 9: exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno
LINE 10: endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in
LINE 11: vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and
LINE 12: carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are
LINE 13: restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the
LINE 14: battle. Hector continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to
LINE 15: their fortifications before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the
LINE 16: watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and
LINE 17: escaping by flight. They kindle fires through all the fields, and pass
LINE 18: the night under arms.
LINE 19: The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of
LINE 20: the poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the
LINE 21: celestial machines) lies in the field towards the seashore.
LINE 22: Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,
LINE 23: Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;
LINE 24: When Jove convened the senate of the skies,
LINE 25: Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,
LINE 26: The sire of gods his awful silence broke;
LINE 27: The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:[189]
LINE 28: "Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,
LINE 29: Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;
LINE 30: The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;
LINE 31: Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!
LINE 32: What god but enters yon forbidden field,
LINE 33: Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,
LINE 34: Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,
LINE 35: Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;
LINE 36: Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,
LINE 37: Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,
LINE 38: With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,
LINE 39: And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;
LINE 40: As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,[190]
LINE 41: As from that centre to the ethereal world.
LINE 42: Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:
LINE 43: And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.
LINE 44: League all your forces, then, ye powers above,
LINE 45: Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.
LINE 46: Let down our golden everlasting chain[191]
LINE 47: Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main
LINE 48: Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,
LINE 49: To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:
LINE 50: Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,
LINE 51: I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;
LINE 52: I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,
LINE 53: And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!
LINE 54: For such I reign, unbounded and above;
LINE 55: And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove."
LINE 56: The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:
LINE 57: A reverend horror silenced all the sky;
LINE 58: Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;
LINE 59: At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:
LINE 60: "O first and greatest! God, by gods adored
LINE 61: We own thy might, our father and our lord!
LINE 62: But, ah! permit to pity human state:
LINE 63: If not to help, at least lament their fate.
LINE 64: From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
LINE 65: With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;
LINE 66: Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,
LINE 67: Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove."
LINE 68: The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,
LINE 69: And smiled superior on his best beloved;
LINE 70: Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;
LINE 71: The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:
LINE 72: Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;
LINE 73: Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:
LINE 74: Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,
LINE 75: Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.
LINE 76: High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly
LINE 77: Between the extended earth and starry sky.
LINE 78: But when to Ida's topmost height he came,
LINE 79: (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)
LINE 80: Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,
LINE 81: His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:
LINE 82: There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire
LINE 83: Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:
LINE 84: Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;
LINE 85: High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;
LINE 86: Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,
LINE 87: The town, and tents, and navigable seas.
LINE 88: Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,
LINE 89: And buckled on their shining arms with haste.
LINE 90: Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day
LINE 91: The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.
LINE 92: The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;
LINE 93: Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:
LINE 94: Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,
LINE 95: The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;
LINE 96: And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,
LINE 97: To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,
LINE 98: Host against host with shadowy legends drew,
LINE 99: The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;
LINE 100: Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,
LINE 101: Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;
LINE 102: With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
LINE 103: And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
LINE 104: Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,
LINE 105: O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,
LINE 106: Commutual death the fate of war confounds,
LINE 107: Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
LINE 108: But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,
LINE 109: The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,[192]
LINE 110: With equal hand: in these explored the fate
LINE 111: Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:
LINE 112: Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies
LINE 113: Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.
LINE 114: Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;
LINE 115: The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;
LINE 116: Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;
LINE 117: Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.
LINE 118: Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;
LINE 119: The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.
LINE 120: Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,
LINE 121: Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:
LINE 122: Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd
LINE 123: Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.
LINE 124: Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart
LINE 125: Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;
LINE 126: Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing mane
LINE 127: Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;
LINE 128: Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,
LINE 129: Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.
LINE 130: Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed
LINE 131: The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,
LINE 132: When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,
LINE 133: Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.
LINE 134: That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand
LINE 135: The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,
LINE 136: But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd
LINE 137: He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:
LINE 138: "Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?
LINE 139: Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son!
LINE 140: Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,
LINE 141: Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?
LINE 142: Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage
LINE 143: The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage."
LINE 144: His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,
LINE 145: Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.
LINE 146: But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,
LINE 147: A single warrior midst a host of foes;
LINE 148: Before the coursers with a sudden spring
LINE 149: He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:
LINE 150: "Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;
LINE 151: These younger champions will oppress thy might.
LINE 152: Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,
LINE 153: Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.
LINE 154: Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car
LINE 155: Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war.
LINE 156: Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
LINE 157: To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:
LINE 158: These late obey'd Æneas' guiding rein;
LINE 159: Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;
LINE 160: With these against yon Trojans will we go,
LINE 161: Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;
LINE 162: Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear
LINE 163: The thirsty fury of my flying spear."
LINE 164: Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war,
LINE 165: Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:
LINE 166: The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;
LINE 167: Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:
LINE 168: The reverend charioteer directs the course,
LINE 169: And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.
LINE 170: Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,
LINE 171: Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl'd his spear.
LINE 172: The spear with erring haste mistook its way,
LINE 173: But plunged in Eniopeus' bosom lay.
LINE 174: His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;
LINE 175: The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.
LINE 176: Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,
LINE 177: Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;
LINE 178: Till, to supply his place and rule the car,
LINE 179: Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.
LINE 180: And now had death and horror cover'd all;[193]
LINE 181: Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall
LINE 182: Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound
LINE 183: Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:
LINE 184: Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew;
LINE 185: The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;
LINE 186: The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;
LINE 187: And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright:
LINE 188: He dropp'd the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,
LINE 189: Thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid Diomed:
LINE 190: "O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence
LINE 191: Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.
LINE 192: This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies
LINE 193: Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.
LINE 194: Some other sun may see the happier hour,
LINE 195: When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.
LINE 196: 'Tis not in man his fix'd decree to move:
LINE 197: The great will glory to submit to Jove."
LINE 198: "O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)
LINE 199: Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
LINE 200: But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast
LINE 201: I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.
LINE 202: Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
LINE 203: O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!"
LINE 204: To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:[194]
LINE 205: "Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?
LINE 206: Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?
LINE 207: Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,
LINE 208: Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;
LINE 209: Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword
LINE 210: That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord."
LINE 211: He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng
LINE 212: Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;
LINE 213: The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;
LINE 214: The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.
LINE 215: Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,
LINE 216: Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.
LINE 217: "Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest
LINE 218: In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:
LINE 219: Now hope no more those honours from thy train;
LINE 220: Go less than woman, in the form of man!
LINE 221: To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,
LINE 222: To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,
LINE 223: Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;
LINE 224: This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead."
LINE 225: Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.
LINE 226: To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;
LINE 227: Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove
LINE 228: On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.
LINE 229: Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,
LINE 230: (The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:
LINE 231: "Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,
LINE 232: All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.
LINE 233: Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,
LINE 234: Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.
LINE 235: Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame
LINE 236: Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.
LINE 237: In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,
LINE 238: Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.
LINE 239: High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,
LINE 240: And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.
LINE 241: Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,
LINE 242: Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;
LINE 243: Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,
LINE 244: All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires."
LINE 245: Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,
LINE 246: Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:
LINE 247: "Now, Xanthus, Æthon, Lampus, urge the chase,
LINE 248: And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;
LINE 249: Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,
LINE 250: And all your master's well-spent care repay.
LINE 251: For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,
LINE 252: Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;
LINE 253: For this my spouse, of great Aëtion's line,
LINE 254: So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.
LINE 255: Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:
LINE 256: Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;
LINE 257: From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,
LINE 258: Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:
LINE 259: These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!
LINE 260: This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!"
LINE 261: That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;
LINE 262: She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:
LINE 263: And thus to Neptune: "Thou, whose force can make
LINE 264: The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,
LINE 265: Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,
LINE 266: Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?
LINE 267: Yet Ægae, Helicè, thy power obey,[195]
LINE 268: And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.
LINE 269: Would all the deities of Greece combine,
LINE 270: In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:
LINE 271: Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,
LINE 272: And see his Trojans to the shades descend:
LINE 273: Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;
LINE 274: Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!"
LINE 275: Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:
LINE 276: "What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?
LINE 277: I war not with the highest. All above
LINE 278: Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove."
LINE 279: Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might
LINE 280: Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,
LINE 281: Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields
LINE 282: With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.
LINE 283: Where the deep trench in length extended lay,
LINE 284: Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,
LINE 285: A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat
LINE 286: With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.
LINE 287: The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,
LINE 288: Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.
LINE 289: Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand
LINE 290: His purple robe, bright ensign of command.
LINE 291: High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:
LINE 292: There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:
LINE 293: To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,
LINE 294: Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.
LINE 295: "O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:
LINE 296: The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)
LINE 297: Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,
LINE 298: Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?
LINE 299: Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,
LINE 300: While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;
LINE 301: But who to meet one martial man is found,
LINE 302: When the fight rages, and the flames surround?
LINE 303: O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd!
LINE 304: Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?
LINE 305: With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain;
LINE 306: My glory ravish'd, and my people slain!
LINE 307: To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;
LINE 308: What altar smoked not with our victims' gore?
LINE 309: With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,
LINE 310: And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.
LINE 311: Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;
LINE 312: Give these at least to 'scape from Hector's hand,
LINE 313: And save the relics of the Grecian land!"
LINE 314: Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard
LINE 315: His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:
LINE 316: The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,
LINE 317: And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.
LINE 318: His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,
LINE 319: A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)
LINE 320: High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,
LINE 321: Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;
LINE 322: Then let the prey before his altar fall;
LINE 323: The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:
LINE 324: Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,
LINE 325: And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.
LINE 326: Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,
LINE 327: O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,
LINE 328: Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,
LINE 329: And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.
LINE 330: Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)
LINE 331: With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;
LINE 332: Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;
LINE 333: The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:
LINE 334: Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;
LINE 335: His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.
LINE 336: Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;
LINE 337: The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:
LINE 338: Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,
LINE 339: And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;
LINE 340: Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,
LINE 341: And last young Teucer with his bended bow.
LINE 342: Secure behind the Telamonian shield
LINE 343: The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,
LINE 344: With every shaft some hostile victim slew,
LINE 345: Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:
LINE 346: The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,
LINE 347: Retires for safety to the mother's arms.
LINE 348: Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,
LINE 349: Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.
LINE 350: Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?
LINE 351: Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:
LINE 352: The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,
LINE 353: With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:
LINE 354: Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;
LINE 355: The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.
LINE 356: Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,
LINE 357: A Trojan ghost attending every dart.
LINE 358: Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye
LINE 359: The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:
LINE 360: "O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)
LINE 361: Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;
LINE 362: Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,
LINE 363: Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!
LINE 364: Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,
LINE 365: The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:
LINE 366: Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,
LINE 367: And the brave son repays his cares with fame.
LINE 368: Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers
LINE 369: Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;
LINE 370: Whatever treasures Greece for me design,
LINE 371: The next rich honorary gift be thine:
LINE 372: Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,
LINE 373: With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:
LINE 374: Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,
LINE 375: Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love."
LINE 376: To this the chief: "With praise the rest inspire,
LINE 377: Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.
LINE 378: What strength I have, be now in battle tried,
LINE 379: Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.
LINE 380: Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,
LINE 381: Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:
LINE 382: Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,
LINE 383: And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:
LINE 384: But sure some god denies me to destroy
LINE 385: This fury of the field, this dog of Troy."
LINE 386: He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies
LINE 387: At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:
LINE 388: He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,
LINE 389: And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.
LINE 390: (Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,
LINE 391: This offspring added to king Priam's line.)
LINE 392: As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,[196]
LINE 393: Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;
LINE 394: So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd
LINE 395: Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.
LINE 396: Another shaft the raging archer drew,
LINE 397: That other shaft with erring fury flew,
LINE 398: (From Hector, Phœbus turn'd the flying wound,)
LINE 399: Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:
LINE 400: Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,
LINE 401: And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.
LINE 402: Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms
LINE 403: The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.
LINE 404: Hector with grief his charioteer beheld
LINE 405: All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:
LINE 406: Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,
LINE 407: Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.
LINE 408: Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,
LINE 409: And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.
LINE 410: The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;
LINE 411: The shaft already to his shoulder drew;
LINE 412: The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,
LINE 413: Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;
LINE 414: There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,
LINE 415: The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:
LINE 416: The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,
LINE 417: And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.
LINE 418: He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,
LINE 419: And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;
LINE 420: Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore
LINE 421: The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.
LINE 422: Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,
LINE 423: He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.
LINE 424: The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,
LINE 425: Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.
LINE 426: First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,
LINE 427: With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.
LINE 428: As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,
LINE 429: With beating bosom, and with eager pace,
LINE 430: Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,
LINE 431: Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;
LINE 432: Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;
LINE 433: Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.
LINE 434: When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,
LINE 435: And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;
LINE 436: Before the ships a desperate stand they made,
LINE 437: And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.
LINE 438: Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:
LINE 439: His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame
LINE 440: That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:
LINE 441: Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!
LINE 442: Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;
LINE 443: Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:
LINE 444: "O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
LINE 445: The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!
LINE 446: Now, in this moment of her last despair,
LINE 447: Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,
LINE 448: Condemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,
LINE 449: And drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?
LINE 450: Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?
LINE 451: What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!
LINE 452: What power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?
LINE 453: Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!"
LINE 454: So spake the imperial regent of the skies;
LINE 455: To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:
LINE 456: "Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,
LINE 457: Stretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:
LINE 458: But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,
LINE 459: Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;
LINE 460: The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,
LINE 461: Forgets my service and deserved reward:
LINE 462: Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,
LINE 463: By stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?
LINE 464: He begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;
LINE 465: I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.
LINE 466: Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,
LINE 467: When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;
LINE 468: The triple dog had never felt his chain,
LINE 469: Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.
LINE 470: Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,
LINE 471: At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;
LINE 472: To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,
LINE 473: My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.
LINE 474: Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved
LINE 475: To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.
LINE 476: Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;
LINE 477: Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.
LINE 478: Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?
LINE 479: (That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)
LINE 480: When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,
LINE 481: All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!
LINE 482: What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,
LINE 483: Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,
LINE 484: Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?"
LINE 485: She ceased, and Juno rein'd the steeds with care:
LINE 486: (Heaven's awful empress, Saturn's other heir:)
LINE 487: Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,
LINE 488: With flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd;
LINE 489: The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove
LINE 490: Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.
LINE 491: Her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,
LINE 492: His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.
LINE 493: The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:
LINE 494: Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:
LINE 495: Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns
LINE 496: Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.
LINE 497: Saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;
LINE 498: Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.
LINE 499: Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,
LINE 500: Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours.
LINE 501: Commission'd in alternate watch they stand,
LINE 502: The sun's bright portals and the skies command;
LINE 503: Close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day
LINE 504: Bar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.
LINE 505: The sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.
LINE 506: Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.
LINE 507: But Jove, incensed, from Ida's top survey'd,
LINE 508: And thus enjoin'd the many-colour'd maid.
LINE 509: [Illustration: ] JUNO AND MINERVA GOING TO ASSIST THE GREEKS
LINE 510: "Thaumantia! mount the winds, and stop their car;
LINE 511: Against the highest who shall wage the war?
LINE 512: If furious yet they dare the vain debate,
LINE 513: Thus have I spoke, and what I speak is fate:
LINE 514: Their coursers crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
LINE 515: Their car in fragments, scatter'd o'er the sky:
LINE 516: My lightning these rebellious shall confound,
LINE 517: And hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,
LINE 518: Condemn'd for ten revolving years to weep
LINE 519: The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
LINE 520: So shall Minerva learn to fear our ire,
LINE 521: Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
LINE 522: For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,
LINE 523: She claims some title to transgress our will."
LINE 524: Swift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid
LINE 525: From Ida's top her golden wings display'd;
LINE 526: To great Olympus' shining gate she flies,
LINE 527: There meets the chariot rushing down the skies,
LINE 528: Restrains their progress from the bright abodes,
LINE 529: And speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.
LINE 530: "What frenzy goddesses! what rage can move
LINE 531: Celestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?
LINE 532: Desist, obedient to his high command:
LINE 533: This is his word; and know his word shall stand:
LINE 534: His lightning your rebellion shall confound,
LINE 535: And hurl ye headlong, flaming, to the ground;
LINE 536: Your horses crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
LINE 537: Your car in fragments scatter'd o'er the sky;
LINE 538: Yourselves condemn'd ten rolling years to weep
LINE 539: The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
LINE 540: So shall Minerva learn to fear his ire,
LINE 541: Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
LINE 542: For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,
LINE 543: She claims some title to transgress his will:
LINE 544: But thee, what desperate insolence has driven
LINE 545: To lift thy lance against the king of heaven?"
LINE 546: Then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,
LINE 547: She flew; and Juno thus her rage resign'd:
LINE 548: "O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
LINE 549: The avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!
LINE 550: No more let beings of superior birth
LINE 551: Contend with Jove for this low race of earth;
LINE 552: Triumphant now, now miserably slain,
LINE 553: They breathe or perish as the fates ordain:
LINE 554: But Jove's high counsels full effect shall find;
LINE 555: And, ever constant, ever rule mankind."
LINE 556: She spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,
LINE 557: Adorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.
LINE 558: The Hours unloosed them, panting as they stood,
LINE 559: And heap'd their mangers with ambrosial food.
LINE 560: There tied, they rest in high celestial stalls;
LINE 561: The chariot propp'd against the crystal walls,
LINE 562: The pensive goddesses, abash'd, controll'd,
LINE 563: Mix with the gods, and fill their seats of gold.
LINE 564: [Illustration: ] THE HOURS TAKING THE HORSES FROM JUNO'S CAR
LINE 565: And now the Thunderer meditates his flight
LINE 566: From Ida's summits to the Olympian height.
LINE 567: Swifter than thought, the wheels instinctive fly,
LINE 568: Flame through the vast of air, and reach the sky.
LINE 569: 'Twas Neptune's charge his coursers to unbrace,
LINE 570: And fix the car on its immortal base;
LINE 571: There stood the chariot, beaming forth its rays,
LINE 572: Till with a snowy veil he screen'd the blaze.
LINE 573: He, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,
LINE 574: The eternal Thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.
LINE 575: High heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,
LINE 576: And wide beneath him all Olympus shakes.
LINE 577: Trembling afar the offending powers appear'd,
LINE 578: Confused and silent, for his frown they fear'd.
LINE 579: He saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:
LINE 580: "Pallas and Juno! say, why heave your hearts?
LINE 581: Soon was your battle o'er: proud Troy retired
LINE 582: Before your face, and in your wrath expired.
LINE 583: But know, whoe'er almighty power withstand!
LINE 584: Unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand:
LINE 585: Who shall the sovereign of the skies control?
LINE 586: Not all the gods that crown the starry pole.
LINE 587: Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,
LINE 588: And each immortal nerve with horror shake.
LINE 589: For thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand;
LINE 590: What power soe'er provokes our lifted hand,
LINE 591: On this our hill no more shall hold his place;
LINE 592: Cut off, and exiled from the ethereal race."
LINE 593: Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doom,
LINE 594: But feast their souls on Ilion's woes to come.
LINE 595: Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,
LINE 596: The prudent goddess yet her wrath repress'd;
LINE 597: But Juno, impotent of rage, replies:
LINE 598: "What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!
LINE 599: Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne;
LINE 600: 'Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.
LINE 601: For Greece we grieve, abandon'd by her fate
LINE 602: To drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.
LINE 603: From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
LINE 604: With arms unaiding see our Argives slain;
LINE 605: Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,
LINE 606: Lest all should perish in the rage of Jove."
LINE 607: The goddess thus; and thus the god replies,
LINE 608: Who swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies:
LINE 609: "The morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,
LINE 610: Shall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.
LINE 611: What heaps of Argives then shall load the plain,
LINE 612: Those radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.
LINE 613: Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight,
LINE 614: The navy flaming, and thy Greeks in flight,
LINE 615: Even till the day when certain fates ordain
LINE 616: That stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)
LINE 617: Shall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.
LINE 618: For such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course
LINE 619: With all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.
LINE 620: Fly, if thy wilt, to earth's remotest bound,
LINE 621: Where on her utmost verge the seas resound;
LINE 622: Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,
LINE 623: Fast by the brink, within the streams of hell;
LINE 624: No sun e'er gilds the gloomy horrors there;
LINE 625: No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:
LINE 626: There arm once more the bold Titanian band;
LINE 627: And arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand."
LINE 628: Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,
LINE 629: And drew behind the cloudy veil of night:
LINE 630: The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay'd;
LINE 631: The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.
LINE 632: The victors keep the field; and Hector calls
LINE 633: A martial council near the navy walls;
LINE 634: These to Scamander's bank apart he led,
LINE 635: Where thinly scatter'd lay the heaps of dead.
LINE 636: The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,
LINE 637: Attend his order, and their prince surround.
LINE 638: A massy spear he bore of mighty strength,
LINE 639: Of full ten cubits was the lance's length;
LINE 640: The point was brass, refulgent to behold,
LINE 641: Fix'd to the wood with circling rings of gold:
LINE 642: The noble Hector on his lance reclined,
LINE 643: And, bending forward, thus reveal'd his mind:
LINE 644: "Ye valiant Trojans, with attention hear!
LINE 645: Ye Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!
LINE 646: This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame
LINE 647: Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.
LINE 648: But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,
LINE 649: And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.
LINE 650: Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours
LINE 651: Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.
LINE 652: Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,
LINE 653: And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought.
LINE 654: Wide o'er the field, high blazing to the sky,
LINE 655: Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,
LINE 656: The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,
LINE 657: Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;
LINE 658: Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,
LINE 659: Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.
LINE 660: Not unmolested let the wretches gain
LINE 661: Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;
LINE 662: Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,
LINE 663: Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,
LINE 664: Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses' care.
LINE 665: And warn their children from a Trojan war.
LINE 666: Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,
LINE 667: Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;
LINE 668: To bid the sires with hoary honours crown'd,
LINE 669: And beardless youths, our battlements surround.
LINE 670: Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,
LINE 671: And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;
LINE 672: Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,
LINE 673: The insidious foe the naked town invade.
LINE 674: Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;
LINE 675: A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.
LINE 676: The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector's hand
LINE 677: From these detested foes to free the land,
LINE 678: Who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way:
LINE 679: For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.
LINE 680: Our common safety must be now the care;
LINE 681: But soon as morning paints the fields of air,
LINE 682: Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,
LINE 683: And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.
LINE 684: Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove
LINE 685: Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.
LINE 686: To-morrow's light (O haste the glorious morn!)
LINE 687: Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,
LINE 688: With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,
LINE 689: And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.
LINE 690: Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,
LINE 691: From age inglorious, and black death secure;
LINE 692: So might my life and glory know no bound,
LINE 693: Like Pallas worshipp'd, like the sun renown'd!
LINE 694: As the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,
LINE 695: Shall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy."
LINE 696: The leader spoke. From all his host around
LINE 697: Shouts of applause along the shores resound.
LINE 698: Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,
LINE 699: And fix'd their headstalls to his chariot-side.
LINE 700: Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,
LINE 701: With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,
LINE 702: Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:
LINE 703: The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.
LINE 704: Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers![197]
LINE 705: Whose wrath hung heavy o'er the Trojan towers:
LINE 706: Nor Priam nor his sons obtain'd their grace;
LINE 707: Proud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.
LINE 708: The troops exulting sat in order round,
LINE 709: And beaming fires illumined all the ground.
LINE 710: As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,[198]
LINE 711: O'er heaven's pure azure spreads her sacred light,
LINE 712: When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
LINE 713: And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,
LINE 714: Around her throne the vivid planets roll,
LINE 715: And stars unnumber'd gild the glowing pole,
LINE 716: O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
LINE 717: And tip with silver every mountain's head:
LINE 718: Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,
LINE 719: A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:
LINE 720: The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
LINE 721: Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.
LINE 722: So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,
LINE 723: And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.
LINE 724: The long reflections of the distant fires
LINE 725: Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.
LINE 726: A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,
LINE 727: And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.
LINE 728: Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,
LINE 729: Whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,
LINE 730: Loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,
LINE 731: And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.
