LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.
LINE 3: The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to
LINE 4: force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas
LINE 5: advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The
LINE 6: Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into five
LINE 7: bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with
LINE 8: a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the
LINE 9: Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector
LINE 10: opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions,
LINE 11: Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a
LINE 12: stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the
LINE 13: head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their
LINE 14: ships.
LINE 15: While thus the hero's pious cares attend
LINE 16: The cure and safety of his wounded friend,
LINE 17: Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,
LINE 18: And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.
LINE 19: Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;
LINE 20: With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;
LINE 21: Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,
LINE 22: The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.
LINE 23: Without the gods, how short a period stands
LINE 24: The proudest monument of mortal hands!
LINE 25: This stood while Hector and Achilles raged,
LINE 26: While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;
LINE 27: But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,
LINE 28: And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;
LINE 29: Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,
LINE 30: Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;
LINE 31: Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,
LINE 32: Caresus roaring down the stony hills,
LINE 33: Æsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,
LINE 34: And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;
LINE 35: And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main[224]
LINE 36: Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:
LINE 37: These, turn'd by Phœbus from their wonted ways,
LINE 38: Deluged the rampire nine continual days;
LINE 39: The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,
LINE 40: And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.
LINE 41: Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,
LINE 42: And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.
LINE 43: The god of ocean, marching stern before,
LINE 44: With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,
LINE 45: Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,
LINE 46: And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.
LINE 47: Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,
LINE 48: No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;
LINE 49: In their old bounds the rivers roll again,
LINE 50: Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.[225]
LINE 51: But this the gods in later times perform;
LINE 52: As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;
LINE 53: The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;
LINE 54: War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.
LINE 55: Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,
LINE 56: Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:
LINE 57: Hector's approach in every wind they hear,
LINE 58: And Hector's fury every moment fear.
LINE 59: He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,
LINE 60: Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.
LINE 61: So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,
LINE 62: Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;
LINE 63: Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,
LINE 64: And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:
LINE 65: His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,
LINE 66: And where he turns the rout disperse or die:
LINE 67: He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,
LINE 68: And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.
LINE 69: With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;
LINE 70: Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.
LINE 71: The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,
LINE 72: And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;
LINE 73: Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,
LINE 74: And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
LINE 75: Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,
LINE 76: Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;
LINE 77: The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)
LINE 78: And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.
LINE 79: The foot alone this strong defence could force,
LINE 80: And try the pass impervious to the horse.
LINE 81: This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,
LINE 82: Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:
LINE 83: "O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!
LINE 84: And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!
LINE 85: What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,
LINE 86: The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?
LINE 87: No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,
LINE 88: No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.
LINE 89: Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,
LINE 90: On certain dangers we too rashly run:
LINE 91: If 'tis his will our haughty foes to tame,
LINE 92: Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!
LINE 93: Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,
LINE 94: And one great day destroy and bury all!
LINE 95: But should they turn, and here oppress our train,
LINE 96: What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
LINE 97: Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,
LINE 98: In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,
LINE 99: All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,
LINE 100: Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.
LINE 101: Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;
LINE 102: Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;
LINE 103: Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,
LINE 104: Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.
LINE 105: So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,
LINE 106: And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."
LINE 107: [Illustration: ] POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR
LINE 108: This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung
LINE 109: Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.
LINE 110: The chief's example follow'd by his train,
LINE 111: Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,
LINE 112: By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd
LINE 113: Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.
LINE 114: The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,
LINE 115: And all obey their several chiefs' commands.
LINE 116: The best and bravest in the first conspire,
LINE 117: Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:
LINE 118: Great Hector glorious in the van of these,
LINE 119: Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.
LINE 120: Before the next the graceful Paris shines,
LINE 121: And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.
LINE 122: The sons of Priam with the third appear,
LINE 123: Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;
LINE 124: In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,
LINE 125: Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,
LINE 126: And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,
LINE 127: The coursers fed on Sellè's winding shore.
LINE 128: Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,
LINE 129: And great Æneas, born on fountful Ide.
LINE 130: Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,
LINE 131: Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.
LINE 132: Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,
LINE 133: But he more brave than all the hosts he led.
LINE 134: Now with compacted shields in close array,
LINE 135: The moving legions speed their headlong way:
LINE 136: Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,
LINE 137: And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.
LINE 138: While every Trojan thus, and every aid,
LINE 139: The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,
LINE 140: Asius alone, confiding in his car,
LINE 141: His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.
LINE 142: Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;
LINE 143: Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;
LINE 144: No more those coursers with triumphant joy
LINE 145: Restore their master to the gates of Troy!
LINE 146: Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,
LINE 147: And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!
LINE 148: Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain
LINE 149: The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;
LINE 150: Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,
LINE 151: The gates half-open'd to receive the last.
LINE 152: Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:
LINE 153: His following host with clamours rend the skies:
LINE 154: To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,
LINE 155: Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!
LINE 156: To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
LINE 157: Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;
LINE 158: This Polypœtes, great Perithous' heir,
LINE 159: And that Leonteus, like the god of war.
LINE 160: As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;
LINE 161: Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:
LINE 162: Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,
LINE 163: Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;
LINE 164: High on the hills appears their stately form,
LINE 165: And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
LINE 166: So graceful these, and so the shock they stand
LINE 167: Of raging Asius, and his furious band.
LINE 168: Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,
LINE 169: And Œnomaus and Thoon close the rear:
LINE 170: In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,
LINE 171: In vain around them beat their hollow shields;
LINE 172: The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,
LINE 173: To guard their navies, and defend the wall.
LINE 174: Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,
LINE 175: And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,
LINE 176: Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,
LINE 177: Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.
LINE 178: So two wild boars spring furious from their den,
LINE 179: Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;
LINE 180: On every side the crackling trees they tear,
LINE 181: And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;
LINE 182: They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,
LINE 183: Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
LINE 184: Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,
LINE 185: With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;
LINE 186: Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers
LINE 187: Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:
LINE 188: To save their fleet their last efforts they try,
LINE 189: And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.
LINE 190: As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings
LINE 191: The dreary winter on his frozen wings;
LINE 192: Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow
LINE 193: Descend, and whiten all the fields below:
LINE 194: So fast the darts on either army pour,
LINE 195: So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:
LINE 196: Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,
LINE 197: And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.
LINE 198: With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,
LINE 199: The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:
LINE 200: "In powers immortal who shall now believe?
LINE 201: Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?
LINE 202: What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power
LINE 203: Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?
LINE 204: But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,
LINE 205: To guard the entrance of their common hive,
LINE 206: Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
LINE 207: They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;
LINE 208: A race determined, that to death contend:
LINE 209: So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.
LINE 210: Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,
LINE 211: Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"
LINE 212: These empty accents mingled with the wind,
LINE 213: Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;
LINE 214: To godlike Hector and his matchless might
LINE 215: Was owed the glory of the destined fight.
LINE 216: Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,
LINE 217: And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;
LINE 218: Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,
LINE 219: The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.
LINE 220: The spirit of a god my breast inspire,
LINE 221: To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!
LINE 222: While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,
LINE 223: Secure of death, confiding in despair;
LINE 224: And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,
LINE 225: With unassisting arms deplored the day.
LINE 226: Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain
LINE 227: The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
LINE 228: First Damasus, by Polypœtes' steel,
LINE 229: Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;
LINE 230: The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!
LINE 231: The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
LINE 232: Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:
LINE 233: Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;
LINE 234: First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,
LINE 235: Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:
LINE 236: Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,
LINE 237: The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:
LINE 238: Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;
LINE 239: And round him rose a monument of dead.
LINE 240: Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,
LINE 241: Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;
LINE 242: Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,
LINE 243: And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
LINE 244: These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,
LINE 245: By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:
LINE 246: A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,
LINE 247: Their martial fury in their wonder lost.
LINE 248: Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;
LINE 249: A bleeding serpent of enormous size,
LINE 250: His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,
LINE 251: He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:
LINE 252: Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,
LINE 253: In airy circles wings his painful way,
LINE 254: Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:
LINE 255: Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
LINE 256: They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,
LINE 257: And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.
LINE 258: Then first Polydamas the silence broke,
LINE 259: Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:
LINE 260: "How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,
LINE 261: For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
LINE 262: True to those counsels which I judge the best,
LINE 263: I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
LINE 264: To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,
LINE 265: In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;
LINE 266: And all I move, deferring to thy sway,
LINE 267: But tends to raise that power which I obey.
LINE 268: Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!
LINE 269: Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;
LINE 270: For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,
LINE 271: And thus my mind explains its clear event:
LINE 272: The victor eagle, whose sinister flight
LINE 273: Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,
LINE 274: Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,
LINE 275: Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;
LINE 276: Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,
LINE 277: Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,
LINE 278: Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;
LINE 279: More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
LINE 280: So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;
LINE 281: For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."
LINE 282: To him then Hector with disdain return'd:
LINE 283: (Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)
LINE 284: "Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
LINE 285: Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:
LINE 286: Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,
LINE 287: Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
LINE 288: What coward counsels would thy madness move
LINE 289: Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?
LINE 290: The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,
LINE 291: And happy thunders of the favouring god,
LINE 292: These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind
LINE 293: By wandering birds that flit with every wind?
LINE 294: Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,
LINE 295: Or where the suns arise, or where descend;
LINE 296: To right, to left, unheeded take your way,
LINE 297: While I the dictates of high heaven obey.
LINE 298: Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
LINE 299: And asks no omen but his country's cause.
LINE 300: But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?
LINE 301: None fears it more, as none promotes it less:
LINE 302: Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
LINE 303: Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
LINE 304: Troy and her sons may find a general grave,
LINE 305: But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.
LINE 306: Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
LINE 307: Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,
LINE 308: My javelin can revenge so base a part,
LINE 309: And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."
LINE 310: Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,
LINE 311: Calls on his host; his host obey the call;
LINE 312: With ardour follow where their leader flies:
LINE 313: Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
LINE 314: Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,
LINE 315: And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;
LINE 316: He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,
LINE 317: And gives great Hector the predestined day.
LINE 318: Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,
LINE 319: Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
LINE 320: In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,
LINE 321: While these they undermine, and those they rend;
LINE 322: Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;
LINE 323: And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
LINE 324: Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;
LINE 325: The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,
LINE 326: Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;
LINE 327: Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
LINE 328: The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,
LINE 329: And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.
LINE 330: The generous impulse every Greek obeys;
LINE 331: Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.
LINE 332: "Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,
LINE 333: And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!
LINE 334: Since not alike endued with force or art;
LINE 335: Behold a day when each may act his part!
LINE 336: A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,
LINE 337: To gain new glories, or augment the old.
LINE 338: Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;
LINE 339: Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;
LINE 340: Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;
LINE 341: Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;
LINE 342: So Jove once more may drive their routed train,
LINE 343: And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."
LINE 344: Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;
LINE 345: And now the stones descend in heavier showers.
LINE 346: As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,
LINE 347: And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;
LINE 348: In winter's bleak uncomfortable reign,
LINE 349: A snowy inundation hides the plain;
LINE 350: He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;
LINE 351: Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;
LINE 352: And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,
LINE 353: Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;
LINE 354: Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,
LINE 355: And one bright waste hides all the works of men:
LINE 356: The circling seas, alone absorbing all,
LINE 357: Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:
LINE 358: So from each side increased the stony rain,
LINE 359: And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.
LINE 360: Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend
LINE 361: To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:
LINE 362: Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,
LINE 363: Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;
LINE 364: For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame
LINE 365: His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.
LINE 366: In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
LINE 367: And bears aloft his ample shield in air;
LINE 368: Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,
LINE 369: Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:
LINE 370: And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
LINE 371: Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.
LINE 372: So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow
LINE 373: Descends a lion on the flocks below;
LINE 374: So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
LINE 375: In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:
LINE 376: In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
LINE 377: And shepherds gall him with an iron war;
LINE 378: Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;
LINE 379: He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.
LINE 380: Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows
LINE 381: With generous rage that drives him on the foes.
LINE 382: He views the towers, and meditates their fall,
LINE 383: To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;
LINE 384: Then casting on his friend an ardent look,
LINE 385: Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:
LINE 386: "Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,[226]
LINE 387: Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,
LINE 388: Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,
LINE 389: And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,
LINE 390: Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,
LINE 391: Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?
LINE 392: Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,
LINE 393: Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,
LINE 394: Unless great acts superior merit prove,
LINE 395: And vindicate the bounteous powers above?
LINE 396: 'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;
LINE 397: The first in valour, as the first in place;
LINE 398: That when with wondering eyes our martial bands
LINE 399: Behold our deeds transcending our commands,
LINE 400: Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
LINE 401: Whom those that envy dare not imitate!
LINE 402: Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,
LINE 403: Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,
LINE 404: For lust of fame I should not vainly dare
LINE 405: In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
LINE 406: But since, alas! ignoble age must come,
LINE 407: Disease, and death's inexorable doom,
LINE 408: The life, which others pay, let us bestow,
LINE 409: And give to fame what we to nature owe;
LINE 410: Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,
LINE 411: Or let us glory gain, or glory give!"
LINE 412: He said; his words the listening chief inspire
LINE 413: With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;
LINE 414: The troops pursue their leaders with delight,
LINE 415: Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.
LINE 416: Menestheus from on high the storm beheld
LINE 417: Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:
LINE 418: Around the walls he gazed, to view from far
LINE 419: What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,
LINE 420: And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,
LINE 421: Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
LINE 422: In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields
LINE 423: Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,
LINE 424: The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,
LINE 425: Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.
LINE 426: Then thus to Thoos: "Hence with speed (he said),
LINE 427: And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;
LINE 428: Their strength, united, best may help to bear
LINE 429: The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
LINE 430: Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,
LINE 431: The best and bravest of the hostile force.
LINE 432: But if too fiercely there the foes contend,
LINE 433: Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,
LINE 434: And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
LINE 435: To share the danger, and repel the foe."
LINE 436: Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along
LINE 437: The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,
LINE 438: And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,
LINE 439: Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
LINE 440: "Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!
LINE 441: Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;
LINE 442: Your strength, united, best may help to bear
LINE 443: The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
LINE 444: Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,
LINE 445: The best and bravest of the hostile force.
LINE 446: But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,
LINE 447: At least, let Telamon those towers defend,
LINE 448: And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
LINE 449: To share the danger, and repel the foe."
LINE 450: Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,
LINE 451: And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:
LINE 452: "Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,
LINE 453: And, brave Oïleus, prove your force in fight;
LINE 454: To you I trust the fortune of the field,
LINE 455: Till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:
LINE 456: That done, expect me to complete the day.
LINE 457: Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away."
LINE 458: With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,
LINE 459: Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.
LINE 460: High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,
LINE 461: Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:
LINE 462: The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,
LINE 463: Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:
LINE 464: The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;
LINE 465: Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.
LINE 466: Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,
LINE 467: And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,
LINE 468: Sarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,
LINE 469: Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;
LINE 470: In modern ages not the strongest swain
LINE 471: Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:
LINE 472: He poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,
LINE 473: It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;
LINE 474: Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,
LINE 475: The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.
LINE 476: As skilful divers from some airy steep
LINE 477: Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,
LINE 478: So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,
LINE 479: And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.
LINE 480: While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,
LINE 481: From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;
LINE 482: The bearded shaft the destined passage found,
LINE 483: And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.
LINE 484: The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast
LINE 485: Might stop the progress of his warlike host,
LINE 486: Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height
LINE 487: Retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.
LINE 488: Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld
LINE 489: Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;
LINE 490: His beating breast with generous ardour glows,
LINE 491: He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.
LINE 492: Alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;
LINE 493: Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;
LINE 494: Then from the yawning wound with fury tore
LINE 495: The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:
LINE 496: Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
LINE 497: His brazen armour rings against the ground.
LINE 498: Swift to the battlement the victor flies,
LINE 499: Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:
LINE 500: It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;
LINE 501: The rolling ruins smoke along the field.
LINE 502: A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;
LINE 503: And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.
LINE 504: At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,
LINE 505: And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;
LINE 506: Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,
LINE 507: And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;
LINE 508: But Jove was present in the dire debate,
LINE 509: To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.
LINE 510: The prince gave back, not meditating flight,
LINE 511: But urging vengeance, and severer fight;
LINE 512: Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,
LINE 513: His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
LINE 514: "O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?
LINE 515: Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!
LINE 516: The breach lies open, but your chief in vain
LINE 517: Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:
LINE 518: Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:
LINE 519: The force of powerful union conquers all."
LINE 520: This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;
LINE 521: They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:
LINE 522: Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,
LINE 523: And fix'd support the weight of all the war;
LINE 524: Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,
LINE 525: Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.
LINE 526: As on the confines of adjoining grounds,
LINE 527: Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;
LINE 528: They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,
LINE 529: One foot, one inch, of the contended field;
LINE 530: Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;
LINE 531: Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
LINE 532: Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
LINE 533: Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;
LINE 534: The copious slaughter covers all the shore,
LINE 535: And the high ramparts drip with human gore.
LINE 536: As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
LINE 537: From side to side the trembling balance nods,
LINE 538: (While some laborious matron, just and poor,
LINE 539: With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)
LINE 540: Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends
LINE 541: Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:[227]
LINE 542: So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,
LINE 543: With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.
LINE 544: Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
LINE 545: And fires his host with loud repeated cries.
LINE 546: "Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,
LINE 547: Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!"
LINE 548: They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,
LINE 549: Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:
LINE 550: Around the works a wood of glittering spears
LINE 551: Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
LINE 552: A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,
LINE 553: Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
LINE 554: Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
LINE 555: Such men as live in these degenerate days:
LINE 556: Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear
LINE 557: The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;
LINE 558: For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load
LINE 559: The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
LINE 560: Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,
LINE 561: Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;
LINE 562: With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
LINE 563: On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
LINE 564: Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
LINE 565: Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,
LINE 566: The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door
LINE 567: Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
LINE 568: Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
LINE 569: Gloomy as night![228] and shakes two shining spears:
LINE 570: A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,
LINE 571: And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.
LINE 572: He moves a god, resistless in his course,
LINE 573: And seems a match for more than mortal force.
LINE 574: Then pouring after, through the gaping space,
LINE 575: A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;
LINE 576: The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;
LINE 577: The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.
