LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE
LINE 3: ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.
LINE 4: Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the
LINE 5: fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the
LINE 6: station of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires
LINE 7: those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals,
LINE 8: encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The
LINE 9: Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector
LINE 10: and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,
LINE 11: losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent
LINE 12: of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,
LINE 13: who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage
LINE 14: above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus
LINE 15: and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus
LINE 16: wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the
LINE 17: left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,
LINE 18: being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to
LINE 19: call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to
LINE 20: rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,
LINE 21: and renews the attack.
LINE 22: The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between
LINE 23: the Grecian wall and the sea-shore.
LINE 24: When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast
LINE 25: Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,
LINE 26: He left them to the fates, in bloody fray
LINE 27: To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.
LINE 28: Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight
LINE 29: Those eyes that shed insufferable light,
LINE 30: To where the Mysians prove their martial force,
LINE 31: And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;
LINE 32: And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,
LINE 33: Renown'd for justice and for length of days;[229]
LINE 34: Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,
LINE 35: From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:
LINE 36: Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene
LINE 37: Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:
LINE 38: No aid, he deems, to either host is given,
LINE 39: While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.
LINE 40: Meantime the monarch of the watery main
LINE 41: Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.
LINE 42: In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow,
LINE 43: Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,
LINE 44: He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes
LINE 45: Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;
LINE 46: Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen;
LINE 47: The crowded ships and sable seas between.
LINE 48: There, from the crystal chambers of the main
LINE 49: Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.
LINE 50: At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,
LINE 51: Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;
LINE 52: Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,
LINE 53: The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,
LINE 54: And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.
LINE 55: From realm to realm three ample strides he took,
LINE 56: And, at the fourth, the distant Ægae shook.
LINE 57: Far in the bay his shining palace stands,
LINE 58: Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:
LINE 59: This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,
LINE 60: Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.
LINE 61: Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,
LINE 62: Immortal arms of adamant and gold.
LINE 63: He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,
LINE 64: He sits superior, and the chariot flies:
LINE 65: His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;
LINE 66: The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep
LINE 67: Gambol around him on the watery way,
LINE 68: And heavy whales in awkward measures play;
LINE 69: The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,
LINE 70: Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;
LINE 71: The parting waves before his coursers fly;
LINE 72: The wondering waters leave his axle dry.
LINE 73: Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,
LINE 74: Between where Tenedos the surges lave,
LINE 75: And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:
LINE 76: There the great ruler of the azure round
LINE 77: Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,
LINE 78: Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,
LINE 79: And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,
LINE 80: Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:
LINE 81: The father of the floods pursues his way:
LINE 82: Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,
LINE 83: Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,
LINE 84: The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,
LINE 85: Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:
LINE 86: To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry
LINE 87: The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:
LINE 88: They vow destruction to the Grecian name,
LINE 89: And in their hopes the fleets already flame.
LINE 90: But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,
LINE 91: The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,
LINE 92: Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,
LINE 93: Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;
LINE 94: His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,
LINE 95: But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.
LINE 96: [Illustration: ] NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA
LINE 97: "'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:
LINE 98: Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!
LINE 99: 'Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;
LINE 100: Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.
LINE 101: On other works though Troy with fury fall,
LINE 102: And pour her armies o'er our batter'd wall:
LINE 103: There Greece has strength: but this, this part o'erthrown,
LINE 104: Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:
LINE 105: Here Hector rages like the force of fire,
LINE 106: Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:
LINE 107: If yet some heavenly power your breast excite,
LINE 108: Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,
LINE 109: Greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain:
LINE 110: And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain."
LINE 111: Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,
LINE 112: He touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls:
LINE 113: Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,
LINE 114: Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.
LINE 115: Then, as a falcon from the rocky height,
LINE 116: Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,
LINE 117: Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,
LINE 118: Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:
LINE 119: Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;
LINE 120: The wide horizon shut him from their view.
LINE 121: The inspiring god Oïleus' active son
LINE 122: Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon:
LINE 123: "Some god, my friend, some god in human form
LINE 124: Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.
LINE 125: Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;
LINE 126: Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:
LINE 127: I mark'd his parting, and the steps he trod;
LINE 128: His own bright evidence reveals a god.
LINE 129: Even now some energy divine I share,
LINE 130: And seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!"
LINE 131: "With equal ardour (Telamon returns)
LINE 132: My soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;
LINE 133: New rising spirits all my force alarm,
LINE 134: Lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.
LINE 135: This ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;
LINE 136: The blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:
LINE 137: Singly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,
LINE 138: And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet."
LINE 139: Full of the god that urged their burning breast,
LINE 140: The heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd.
LINE 141: Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;
LINE 142: Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,
LINE 143: Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,
LINE 144: And swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls:
LINE 145: Trembling before the impending storm they lie,
LINE 146: While tears of rage stand burning in their eye.
LINE 147: Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;
LINE 148: But breathe new courage as they feel the power.
LINE 149: Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;
LINE 150: Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;
LINE 151: Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown'd,
LINE 152: And Merion next, the impulsive fury found;
LINE 153: Last Nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,
LINE 154: While thus the god the martial fire awakes:
LINE 155: "Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace
LINE 156: To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!
LINE 157: I trusted in the gods, and you, to see
LINE 158: Brave Greece victorious, and her navy free:
LINE 159: Ah, no—the glorious combat you disclaim,
LINE 160: And one black day clouds all her former fame.
LINE 161: Heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,
LINE 162: Unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!
LINE 163: Fly we at length from Troy's oft-conquer'd bands?
LINE 164: And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?
LINE 165: A rout undisciplined, a straggling train,
LINE 166: Not born to glories of the dusty plain;
LINE 167: Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,
LINE 168: A prey to every savage of the wood:
LINE 169: Shall these, so late who trembled at your name,
LINE 170: Invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?
LINE 171: A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?
LINE 172: The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?
LINE 173: Fools! will ye perish for your leader's vice;
LINE 174: The purchase infamy, and life the price?
LINE 175: 'Tis not your cause, Achilles' injured fame:
LINE 176: Another's is the crime, but yours the shame.
LINE 177: Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,
LINE 178: Must you be cowards, if your king's unjust?
LINE 179: Prevent this evil, and your country save:
LINE 180: Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.
LINE 181: Think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame
LINE 182: I waste no anger, for they feel no shame:
LINE 183: But you, the pride, the flower of all our host,
LINE 184: My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!
LINE 185: Nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;
LINE 186: A day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.
LINE 187: Let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,
LINE 188: On endless infamy, on instant death:
LINE 189: For, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore:
LINE 190: Hark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!
LINE 191: Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall;
LINE 192: The hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall."
LINE 193: These words the Grecians' fainting hearts inspire,
LINE 194: And listening armies catch the godlike fire.
LINE 195: Fix'd at his post was each bold Ajax found,
LINE 196: With well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:
LINE 197: So close their order, so disposed their fight,
LINE 198: As Pallas' self might view with fix'd delight;
LINE 199: Or had the god of war inclined his eyes,
LINE 200: The god of war had own'd a just surprise.
LINE 201: A chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,
LINE 202: Descending Hector and his battle wait.
LINE 203: An iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,
LINE 204: Armour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields,
LINE 205: Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,
LINE 206: Helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.
LINE 207: The floating plumes unnumber'd wave above,
LINE 208: As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;
LINE 209: And levell'd at the skies with pointing rays,
LINE 210: Their brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.
LINE 211: Thus breathing death, in terrible array,
LINE 212: The close compacted legions urged their way:
LINE 213: Fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;
LINE 214: Troy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.
LINE 215: As from some mountain's craggy forehead torn,
LINE 216: A rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne,
LINE 217: (Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)
LINE 218: Precipitate the ponderous mass descends:
LINE 219: From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;
LINE 220: At every shock the crackling wood resounds;
LINE 221: Still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,
LINE 222: Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:
LINE 223: There stops—so Hector. Their whole force he proved,[230]
LINE 224: Resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.
LINE 225: On him the war is bent, the darts are shed,
LINE 226: And all their falchions wave around his head:
LINE 227: Repulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;
LINE 228: But with repeated shouts his army fires.
LINE 229: "Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way
LINE 230: Through yon square body, and that black array:
LINE 231: Stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,
LINE 232: Strong as they seem, embattled like a tower;
LINE 233: For he that Juno's heavenly bosom warms,
LINE 234: The first of gods, this day inspires our arms."
LINE 235: He said; and roused the soul in every breast:
LINE 236: Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,
LINE 237: Forth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held
LINE 238: Before his wary steps his ample shield.
LINE 239: Bold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);
LINE 240: The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;
LINE 241: But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,
LINE 242: The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.
LINE 243: The Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,
LINE 244: On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.
LINE 245: The Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,
LINE 246: And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;
LINE 247: Then to the ships with surly speed he went,
LINE 248: To seek a surer javelin in his tent.
LINE 249: Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,
LINE 250: The tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.
LINE 251: By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,
LINE 252: The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.
LINE 253: Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,
LINE 254: In fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,
LINE 255: The youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,
LINE 256: And blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:
LINE 257: (This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy,
LINE 258: Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:)
LINE 259: To Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,
LINE 260: And match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:
LINE 261: With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,
LINE 262: He lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.
LINE 263: Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:
LINE 264: He groans beneath the Telamonian spear.
LINE 265: As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,
LINE 266: Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,
LINE 267: And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;
LINE 268: So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.
LINE 269: Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,
LINE 270: From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:
LINE 271: He saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart
LINE 272: Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart,
LINE 273: Cteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line;
LINE 274: Vain was his courage, and his race divine!
LINE 275: Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,
LINE 276: And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.
LINE 277: To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,
LINE 278: And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,
LINE 279: When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;
LINE 280: Full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;
LINE 281: He felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,
LINE 282: Secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.
LINE 283: Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain
LINE 284: The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.
LINE 285: Between the leaders of the Athenian line,
LINE 286: (Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)
LINE 287: Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;
LINE 288: Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.
LINE 289: As two grim lions bear across the lawn,
LINE 290: Snatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.
LINE 291: In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,
LINE 292: And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;
LINE 293: So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead
LINE 294: Strips his bright arms; Oïleus lops his head:
LINE 295: Toss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,
LINE 296: At Hector's feet the gory visage lay.
LINE 297: The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,
LINE 298: And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,
LINE 299: Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,
LINE 300: And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.
LINE 301: Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,
LINE 302: He finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,
LINE 303: His pensive brow the generous care express'd
LINE 304: With which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,
LINE 305: Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,
LINE 306: And his sad comrades from the battle bore;
LINE 307: Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:
LINE 308: That office paid, he issued from his tent
LINE 309: Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,
LINE 310: In Thoas' voice, Andræmon's valiant son,
LINE 311: Who ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise,
LINE 312: And Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:
LINE 313: "Where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,
LINE 314: Of Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?"
LINE 315: To whom the king: "On Greece no blame be thrown;
LINE 316: Arms are her trade, and war is all her own.
LINE 317: Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains
LINE 318: Nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:
LINE 319: 'Tis heaven, alas! and Jove's all-powerful doom,
LINE 320: That far, far distant from our native home
LINE 321: Wills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!
LINE 322: Once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend
LINE 323: Or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,
LINE 324: And what thou canst not singly, urge the rest."
LINE 325: Thus he: and thus the god whose force can make
LINE 326: The solid globe's eternal basis shake:
LINE 327: "Ah! never may he see his native land,
LINE 328: But feed the vultures on this hateful strand,
LINE 329: Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,
LINE 330: Nor dares to combat on this signal day!
LINE 331: For this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,
LINE 332: And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.
LINE 333: Together let us battle on the plain;
LINE 334: Two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:
LINE 335: Not vain the weakest, if their force unite;
LINE 336: But ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight."
LINE 337: This said, he rushes where the combat burns;
LINE 338: Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:
LINE 339: From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,
LINE 340: And clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,
LINE 341: Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,
LINE 342: Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,
LINE 343: Which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,
LINE 344: Or terrifies the offending world with wars;
LINE 345: In streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,
LINE 346: From pole to pole the trail of glory flies:
LINE 347: Thus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng
LINE 348: Gleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.
LINE 349: Him, near his tent, Meriones attends;
LINE 350: Whom thus he questions: "Ever best of friends!
LINE 351: O say, in every art of battle skill'd,
LINE 352: What holds thy courage from so brave a field?
LINE 353: On some important message art thou bound,
LINE 354: Or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?
LINE 355: Inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,
LINE 356: And glows with prospects of th' approaching day."
LINE 357: "O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care
LINE 358: Leads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;
LINE 359: This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;
LINE 360: The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield."
LINE 361: To whom the Cretan: "Enter, and receive
LINE 362: The wonted weapons; those my tent can give;
LINE 363: Spears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)
LINE 364: That shed a lustre round the illumined wall,
LINE 365: Though I, disdainful of the distant war,
LINE 366: Nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,
LINE 367: Yet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;
LINE 368: And thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.
LINE 369: Enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,
LINE 370: And high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold."
LINE 371: "Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;
LINE 372: We too can boast of no ignoble spoils:
LINE 373: But those my ship contains; whence distant far,
LINE 374: I fight conspicuous in the van of war,
LINE 375: What need I more? If any Greek there be
LINE 376: Who knows not Merion, I appeal to thee."
LINE 377: To this, Idomeneus: "The fields of fight
LINE 378: Have proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:
LINE 379: And were some ambush for the foes design'd,
LINE 380: Even there thy courage would not lag behind:
LINE 381: In that sharp service, singled from the rest,
LINE 382: The fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.
LINE 383: No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;
LINE 384: He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:
LINE 385: A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;
LINE 386: Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;
LINE 387: Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;
LINE 388: With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,
LINE 389: And looks a bloodless image of despair!
LINE 390: Not so the brave—still dauntless, still the same,
LINE 391: Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:
LINE 392: Composed his thought, determined is his eye,
LINE 393: And fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:
LINE 394: If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,
LINE 395: 'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.
LINE 396: "In such assays thy blameless worth is known,
LINE 397: And every art of dangerous war thy own.
LINE 398: By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,
LINE 399: Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;
LINE 400: Such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight
LINE 401: T'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.
LINE 402: But why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,
LINE 403: Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?
LINE 404: Go—from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,
LINE 405: And to their owners send them nobly back."
LINE 406: Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear
LINE 407: And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.
LINE 408: So Mars armipotent invades the plain,
LINE 409: (The wide destroyer of the race of man,)
LINE 410: Terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,
LINE 411: Arm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force;
LINE 412: The pride of haughty warriors to confound,
LINE 413: And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:
LINE 414: From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms
LINE 415: Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;
LINE 416: Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,
LINE 417: To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.
LINE 418: So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,
LINE 419: And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.
LINE 420: Then first spake Merion: "Shall we join the right,
LINE 421: Or combat in the centre of the fight?
LINE 422: Or to the left our wonted succour lend?
LINE 423: Hazard and fame all parts alike attend."
LINE 424: "Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)
LINE 425: Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;
LINE 426: Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care,
LINE 427: And gallant Teucer deals destruction there,
LINE 428: Skill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,
LINE 429: Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.
LINE 430: These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:
LINE 431: Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,
LINE 432: Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,
LINE 433: And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.
LINE 434: Great must he be, of more than human birth,
LINE 435: Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.
LINE 436: Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,
LINE 437: Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.
LINE 438: In standing fight he mates Achilles' force,
LINE 439: Excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.
LINE 440: Then to the left our ready arms apply,
LINE 441: And live with glory, or with glory die."
LINE 442: He said: and Merion to th' appointed place,
LINE 443: Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.
LINE 444: Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld
LINE 445: Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,
LINE 446: Their force embodied in a tide they pour;
LINE 447: The rising combat sounds along the shore.
LINE 448: As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign,
LINE 449: From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;
LINE 450: On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,
LINE 451: And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:
LINE 452: Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,
LINE 453: Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.
LINE 454: All dreadful glared the iron face of war,
LINE 455: Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;
LINE 456: Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,
LINE 457: And polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields:
LINE 458: Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,
LINE 459: But touch'd with joy the bosoms of the brave.
LINE 460: Saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied,
LINE 461: And crowds of heroes in their anger died.
LINE 462: The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won
LINE 463: To crown with glory Peleus' godlike son,
LINE 464: Will'd not destruction to the Grecian powers,
LINE 465: But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;
LINE 466: While Neptune, rising from his azure main,
LINE 467: Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain,
LINE 468: And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.
LINE 469: Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,
LINE 470: Alike divine, and heaven their native place;
LINE 471: But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,
LINE 472: And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.
LINE 473: For this, of Jove's superior might afraid,
LINE 474: Neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.
LINE 475: These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train
LINE 476: In war and discord's adamantine chain,
LINE 477: Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie
LINE 478: Is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.
LINE 479: Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,
LINE 480: The bold Idomeneus controls the day.
LINE 481: First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,
LINE 482: Swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;
LINE 483: Call'd by the voice of war to martial fame,
LINE 484: From high Cabesus' distant walls he came;
LINE 485: Cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,
LINE 486: And promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.
LINE 487: The king consented, by his vaunts abused;
LINE 488: The king consented, but the fates refused.
LINE 489: Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,
LINE 490: The field he measured with a larger stride.
LINE 491: Him as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;
LINE 492: Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:
LINE 493: His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;
LINE 494: His arms resounded as the boaster fell.
LINE 495: The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;
LINE 496: "And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!
LINE 497: Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,
LINE 498: And such the contract of the Phrygian king!
LINE 499: Our offers now, illustrious prince! receive;
LINE 500: For such an aid what will not Argos give?
LINE 501: To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,
LINE 502: And count Atrides' fairest daughter thine.
LINE 503: Meantime, on further methods to advise,
LINE 504: Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;
LINE 505: There hear what Greece has on her part to say."
LINE 506: He spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.
LINE 507: This Asius view'd, unable to contain,
LINE 508: Before his chariot warring on the plain:
LINE 509: (His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,
LINE 510: Impatient panted on his neck behind:)
LINE 511: To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,
LINE 512: He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.
LINE 513: The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,
LINE 514: Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:
LINE 515: Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,
LINE 516: And glitter'd, extant at the further side.
LINE 517: As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,
LINE 518: Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,
LINE 519: Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,
LINE 520: Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:
LINE 521: So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,
LINE 522: And stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.
LINE 523: He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
LINE 524: And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.
LINE 525: Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,
LINE 526: Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,
LINE 527: Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,
LINE 528: But falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:
LINE 529: Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath
LINE 530: The stately car, and labours out his breath.
LINE 531: Thus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)
LINE 532: Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.
LINE 533: Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,
LINE 534: And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.
LINE 535: The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance
LINE 536: From his slope shield the disappointed lance.
LINE 537: Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,
LINE 538: Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,
LINE 539: On his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)
LINE 540: He lay collected in defensive shade.
LINE 541: O'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,
LINE 542: And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.
LINE 543: Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,
LINE 544: And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:
LINE 545: Warm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore
LINE 546: The chief, his people's guardian now no more!
LINE 547: "Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)
LINE 548: Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:
LINE 549: For thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,
LINE 550: This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade."
LINE 551: Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,
LINE 552: Touch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.
LINE 553: Grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,
LINE 554: And his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:
LINE 555: Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore
LINE 556: His honour'd body to the tented shore.
LINE 557: Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;
LINE 558: Resolved to perish in his country's cause,
LINE 559: Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom
LINE 560: To wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.
LINE 561: He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:
LINE 562: Great Æsyetes was the hero's sire;
LINE 563: His spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,
LINE 564: Anchises' eldest hope, and darling care:
LINE 565: Who charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart
LINE 566: With beauty, sense, and every work of art:
LINE 567: He once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,
LINE 568: The fairest she of all the fair of Troy.
LINE 569: By Neptune now the hapless hero dies,
LINE 570: Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,
LINE 571: And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet
LINE 572: His fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.
LINE 573: Fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,
LINE 574: While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.
LINE 575: Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,
LINE 576: Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.
LINE 577: The riven armour sends a jarring sound;
LINE 578: His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,
LINE 579: The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;
LINE 580: Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,
LINE 581: Life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.
LINE 582: Then Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:
LINE 583: "Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:
LINE 584: See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;
LINE 585: This, my third victim, to the shades I send.
LINE 586: Approaching now thy boasted might approve,
LINE 587: And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.
LINE 588: From Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,
LINE 589: Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:
LINE 590: Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;
LINE 591: His first-born I, the third from Jupiter:
LINE 592: O'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,
LINE 593: And thence my ships transport me through the main:
LINE 594: Lord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,
LINE 595: A scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line."
LINE 596: The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,
LINE 597: Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,
LINE 598: Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed
LINE 599: To call some hero to partake the deed,
LINE 600: Forthwith Æneas rises to his thought:
LINE 601: For him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,
LINE 602: Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,
LINE 603: And sees superior posts in meaner hands.
LINE 604: To him, ambitious of so great an aid,
LINE 605: The bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:
LINE 606: "Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,
LINE 607: If e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.
LINE 608: Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;
LINE 609: Come, and the warrior's loved remains defend.
LINE 610: Beneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,
LINE 611: One table fed you, and one roof contain'd.
LINE 612: This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;
LINE 613: Haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe."
LINE 614: Æneas heard, and for a space resign'd
LINE 615: To tender pity all his manly mind;
LINE 616: Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:
LINE 617: The Greek awaits him with collected might.
LINE 618: As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,
LINE 619: Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,
LINE 620: When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,
LINE 621: Attends the tumult, and expects the war;
LINE 622: O'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;
LINE 623: Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,
LINE 624: His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;
LINE 625: But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:
LINE 626: So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,
LINE 627: And met the Trojan with a lowering look.
LINE 628: Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,
LINE 629: The youthful offspring of the god of war,
LINE 630: Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:
LINE 631: To these the warrior sent his voice around.
LINE 632: "Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;
LINE 633: Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:
LINE 634: Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;
LINE 635: He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.
LINE 636: Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,
LINE 637: The great dispute, of glory, or of life."
LINE 638: He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;
LINE 639: Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
LINE 640: Around the chief. Æneas too demands
LINE 641: Th' assisting forces of his native bands;
LINE 642: Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;
LINE 643: (Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)
LINE 644: In order follow all th' embodied train,
LINE 645: Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;
LINE 646: Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,
LINE 647: Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.
LINE 648: With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads
LINE 649: To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:
LINE 650: So joys Æneas, as his native band
LINE 651: Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.
LINE 652: Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;
LINE 653: On every side the steely circle grows;
LINE 654: Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,
LINE 655: And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.
LINE 656: Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,
LINE 657: There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.
LINE 658: Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,
LINE 659: And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.
LINE 660: The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;
LINE 661: The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:
LINE 662: Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood
LINE 663: Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.
LINE 664: But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;
LINE 665: The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,
LINE 666: It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,
LINE 667: And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.
LINE 668: Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,
LINE 669: And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.
LINE 670: The victor from his breast the weapon tears;
LINE 671: His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.
LINE 672: Though now unfit an active war to wage,
LINE 673: Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,
LINE 674: His listless limbs unable for the course,
LINE 675: In standing fight he yet maintains his force;
LINE 676: Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,
LINE 677: His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.
LINE 678: Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,
LINE 679: And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:
LINE 680: The javelin err'd, but held its course along,
LINE 681: And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:
LINE 682: The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,
LINE 683: And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.
LINE 684: Nor knew the furious father of his fall;
LINE 685: High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,
LINE 686: On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;
LINE 687: Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.
LINE 688: Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,
LINE 689: For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,
LINE 690: Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,
LINE 691: And from his temples rends the glittering prize;
LINE 692: Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,
LINE 693: And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:
LINE 694: He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;
LINE 695: The hollow helmet rings against the plain.
LINE 696: Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,
LINE 697: From his torn arm the Grecian rent away
LINE 698: The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.
LINE 699: His wounded brother good Polites tends;
LINE 700: Around his waist his pious arms he threw,
LINE 701: And from the rage of battle gently drew:
LINE 702: Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,
LINE 703: Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;
LINE 704: To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,
LINE 705: And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.
LINE 706: Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,
LINE 707: Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.
LINE 708: Bold Aphareus by great Æneas bled;
LINE 709: As toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,
LINE 710: He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd
LINE 711: Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;
LINE 712: His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,
LINE 713: And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.
LINE 714: Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,
LINE 715: Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:
LINE 716: The hollow vein, that to the neck extends
LINE 717: Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:
LINE 718: Supine he falls, and to his social train
LINE 719: Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.
LINE 720: Thv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,
LINE 721: From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;
LINE 722: His time observed; for closed by foes around,
LINE 723: On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.
LINE 724: His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,
LINE 725: But he impervious and untouch'd remains.
LINE 726: (Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage
LINE 727: This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)
LINE 728: In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,
LINE 729: Faced every foe, and every danger sought;
LINE 730: His winged lance, resistless as the wind,
LINE 731: Obeys each motion of the master's mind!
LINE 732: Restless it flies, impatient to be free,
LINE 733: And meditates the distant enemy.
LINE 734: The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,
LINE 735: And struck his target with the brazen spear
LINE 736: Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,
LINE 737: And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:
LINE 738: In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,
LINE 739: Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.
LINE 740: Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;
LINE 741: But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,
LINE 742: Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,
LINE 743: Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.
LINE 744: Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,
LINE 745: Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,
LINE 746: While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,
LINE 747: His bulk enormous on the field displays;
LINE 748: His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.
LINE 749: The spear the conqueror from his body drew,
LINE 750: And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.
LINE 751: Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:
LINE 752: King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,
LINE 753: And smote his temples with an arm so strong,
LINE 754: The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:
LINE 755: There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;
LINE 756: For dark in death the godlike owner lies!
LINE 757: Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,
LINE 758: And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:
LINE 759: That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;
LINE 760: And this stood adverse with the bended bow:
LINE 761: Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,
LINE 762: But harmless bounded from the plated steel.
LINE 763: As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,
LINE 764: (The winds collected at each open door,)
LINE 765: While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,
LINE 766: Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:
LINE 767: So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,
LINE 768: Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.
LINE 769: Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,
LINE 770: Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.
LINE 771: And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand
LINE 772: Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:
LINE 773: But good Agenor gently from the wound
LINE 774: The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;
LINE 775: A sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,
LINE 776: At once the tent and ligature supplied.
LINE 777: Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,
LINE 778: Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,
LINE 779: Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:
LINE 780: High-towering in the front, the warrior came.
LINE 781: First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;
LINE 782: The lance far distant by the winds was blown.
LINE 783: Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:
LINE 784: Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.
LINE 785: Not so discouraged, to the future blind,
LINE 786: Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;
LINE 787: Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord
LINE 788: Like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.
LINE 789: His left arm high opposed the shining shield:
LINE 790: His right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;
LINE 791: (An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,
LINE 792: Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)
LINE 793: This on the helm discharged a noble blow;
LINE 794: The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,
LINE 795: Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:
LINE 796: Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;
LINE 797: The crashing bones before its force gave way;
LINE 798: In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:
LINE 799: Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,
LINE 800: The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.
LINE 801: And fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,
LINE 802: Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:
LINE 803: "Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;
LINE 804: O race perfidious, who delight in war!
LINE 805: Already noble deeds ye have perform'd;
LINE 806: A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:
LINE 807: In such bold feats your impious might approve,
LINE 808: Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.
LINE 809: The violated rites, the ravish'd dame;
LINE 810: Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,
LINE 811: Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,
LINE 812: And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.
LINE 813: O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,
LINE 814: Above the thought of man, supremely wise!
LINE 815: If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,
LINE 816: From whence this favour to an impious foe?
LINE 817: A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,
LINE 818: Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?
LINE 819: The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;
LINE 820: Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;
LINE 821: The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,
LINE 822: Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.
LINE 823: But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight
LINE 824: In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight."
LINE 825: This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)
LINE 826: The bloody armour, which his train received:
LINE 827: Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,
LINE 828: And the bold son of Pylæmenes slew.
LINE 829: Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far,
LINE 830: Following his martial father to the war:
LINE 831: Through filial love he left his native shore,
LINE 832: Never, ah, never to behold it more!
LINE 833: His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling
LINE 834: Against the target of the Spartan king;
LINE 835: Thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,
LINE 836: And turns around his apprehensive eyes.
LINE 837: Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,
LINE 838: The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.
LINE 839: Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,
LINE 840: And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:
LINE 841: Sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,
LINE 842: And in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;
LINE 843: (Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)
LINE 844: While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.
LINE 845: Him on his car the Paphlagonian train
LINE 846: In slow procession bore from off the plain.
LINE 847: The pensive father, father now no more!
LINE 848: Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;
LINE 849: And unavailing tears profusely shed;
LINE 850: And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.
LINE 851: Paris from far the moving sight beheld,
LINE 852: With pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:
LINE 853: His honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,
LINE 854: And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!
LINE 855: With his full strength he bent his angry bow,
LINE 856: And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.
LINE 857: A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,
LINE 858: For riches much, and more for virtue famed.
LINE 859: Who held his seat in Corinth's stately town;
LINE 860: Polydus' son, a seer of old renown.
LINE 861: Oft had the father told his early doom,
LINE 862: By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:
LINE 863: He climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,
LINE 864: And chose the certain glorious path to death.
LINE 865: Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;
LINE 866: The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:
LINE 867: His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,
LINE 868: And everlasting darkness shades him round.
LINE 869: Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,
LINE 870: (Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)
LINE 871: Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,
LINE 872: And conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;
LINE 873: With such a tide superior virtue sway'd,
LINE 874: And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.
LINE 875: But in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,
LINE 876: Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;
LINE 877: There, on the margin of the hoary deep,
LINE 878: (Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.
LINE 879: And where low walls confine the beating tides,
LINE 880: Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;
LINE 881: Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,
LINE 882: And all the thunder of the battle raged,)
LINE 883: There join'd, the whole Bœotian strength remains,
LINE 884: The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,
LINE 885: Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;
LINE 886: But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.
LINE 887: The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;
LINE 888: Bias and great Menestheus at their head:
LINE 889: Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,
LINE 890: And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:
LINE 891: The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,
LINE 892: And brave Podarces, active in the fight.
LINE 893: This drew from Phylacus his noble line;
LINE 894: Iphiclus' son: and that (Oïleus) thine:
LINE 895: (Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;
LINE 896: He dwelt far distant from his native place,
LINE 897: By his fierce step-dame from his father's reign
LINE 898: Expell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)
LINE 899: These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,
LINE 900: Mix'd with Bœotians, on the shores of Troy.
LINE 901: Now side by side, with like unwearied care,
LINE 902: Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:
LINE 903: So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,
LINE 904: Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,
LINE 905: Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,
LINE 906: And trace large furrows with the shining share;
LINE 907: O'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,
LINE 908: And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.
LINE 909: A train of heroes followed through the field,
LINE 910: Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;
LINE 911: Whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,
LINE 912: Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.
LINE 913: No following troops his brave associate grace:
LINE 914: In close engagement an unpractised race,
LINE 915: The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,
LINE 916: Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;
LINE 917: But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,
LINE 918: Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,
LINE 919: Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,
LINE 920: Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.
LINE 921: Thus in the van the Telamonian train,
LINE 922: Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:
LINE 923: Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,
LINE 924: Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,
LINE 925: The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;
LINE 926: Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.
LINE 927: Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,
LINE 928: And the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;
LINE 929: But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,
LINE 930: Address'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:
LINE 931: "Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend
LINE 932: Impartial audience to a faithful friend;
LINE 933: To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,
LINE 934: And every art of glorious war thy own;
LINE 935: But in cool thought and counsel to excel,
LINE 936: How widely differs this from warring well!
LINE 937: Content with what the bounteous gods have given,
LINE 938: Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.
LINE 939: To some the powers of bloody war belong,
LINE 940: To some sweet music and the charm of song;
LINE 941: To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd
LINE 942: A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;
LINE 943: Their guardians these, the nations round confess,
LINE 944: And towns and empires for their safety bless.
LINE 945: If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,
LINE 946: Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,
LINE 947: See, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,
LINE 948: And war's whole fury burns around thy head.
LINE 949: Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,
LINE 950: How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!
LINE 951: What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!
LINE 952: And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!
LINE 953: Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings
LINE 954: Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.
LINE 955: Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)
LINE 956: To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;
LINE 957: Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,
LINE 958: Contented with the conquest of the day.
LINE 959: I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,
LINE 960: Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;
LINE 961: Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains
LINE 962: On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!"
LINE 963: The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,
LINE 964: Leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;
LINE 965: Swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.
LINE 966: "To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,
LINE 967: And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;
LINE 968: Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,
LINE 969: And hasten back to end the doubtful day."
LINE 970: This said, the towering chief prepares to go,
LINE 971: Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,
LINE 972: And seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.
LINE 973: Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,
LINE 974: And bids anew the martial thunder rise.
LINE 975: To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command
LINE 976: Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:
LINE 977: But round the battlements, and round the plain,
LINE 978: For many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;
LINE 979: Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,
LINE 980: Nor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:
LINE 981: For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,
LINE 982: Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;
LINE 983: Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;
LINE 984: High on the wall some breathed their souls away.
LINE 985: Far on the left, amid the throng he found
LINE 986: (Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)
LINE 987: The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,
LINE 988: Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:
LINE 989: "Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,
LINE 990: As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!
LINE 991: Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?
LINE 992: The godlike father, and th' intrepid son?
LINE 993: The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;
LINE 994: And great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?
LINE 995: Black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,
LINE 996: Imperial Troy from her foundations nods;
LINE 997: Whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,
LINE 998: And one devouring vengeance swallow all."
LINE 999: When Paris thus: "My brother and my friend,
LINE 1000: Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,
LINE 1001: In other battles I deserved thy blame,
LINE 1002: Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:
LINE 1003: But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,
LINE 1004: I scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.
LINE 1005: The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;
LINE 1006: Of all those heroes, two alone remain;
LINE 1007: Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,
LINE 1008: Each now disabled by a hostile spear.
LINE 1009: Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:
LINE 1010: This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:
LINE 1011: What with this arm I can, prepare to know,
LINE 1012: Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.
LINE 1013: But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own
LINE 1014: To combat: strength is of the gods alone."
LINE 1015: These words the hero's angry mind assuage:
LINE 1016: Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.
LINE 1017: Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood,
LINE 1018: Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,
LINE 1019: Palmus, with Polypœtes the divine,
LINE 1020: And two bold brothers of Hippotion's line
LINE 1021: (Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far,
LINE 1022: The former day; the next engaged in war).
LINE 1023: As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,
LINE 1024: That bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,
LINE 1025: Wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;
LINE 1026: Then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps;
LINE 1027: The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;
LINE 1028: The waves behind impel the waves before,
LINE 1029: Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:
LINE 1030: Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,
LINE 1031: Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.
LINE 1032: Far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,
LINE 1033: The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:
LINE 1034: Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,
LINE 1035: Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.
LINE 1036: Before him flaming his enormous shield,
LINE 1037: Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;
LINE 1038: His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;
LINE 1039: His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,
LINE 1040: And, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,
LINE 1041: Shot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.
LINE 1042: Thus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:
LINE 1043: Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.
LINE 1044: The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,
LINE 1045: Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:
LINE 1046: "Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;
LINE 1047: 'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:
LINE 1048: The skill of war to us not idly given,
LINE 1049: Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.
LINE 1050: Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,
LINE 1051: To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.
LINE 1052: Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,
LINE 1053: Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,
LINE 1054: Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;
LINE 1055: And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.
LINE 1056: The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,
LINE 1057: Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;
LINE 1058: Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,
LINE 1059: The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;
LINE 1060: Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,
LINE 1061: While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame."
LINE 1062: As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,
LINE 1063: On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.
LINE 1064: To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,
LINE 1065: And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:
LINE 1066: Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;
LINE 1067: They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:
LINE 1068: "From whence this menace, this insulting strain?
LINE 1069: Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.
LINE 1070: So may the gods on Hector life bestow,
LINE 1071: (Not that short life which mortals lead below,
LINE 1072: But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,
LINE 1073: The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)
LINE 1074: As this decisive day shall end the fame
LINE 1075: Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.
LINE 1076: And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait
LINE 1077: The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:
LINE 1078: That giant-corse, extended on the shore,
LINE 1079: Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."
LINE 1080: He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:
LINE 1081: With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,
LINE 1082: Sent from his following host: the Grecian train
LINE 1083: With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;
LINE 1084: A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,
LINE 1085: Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.
