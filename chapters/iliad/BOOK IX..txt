LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.
LINE 3: Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit
LINE 4: the siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor
LINE 5: seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to
LINE 6: be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are
LINE 7: to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and
LINE 8: Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in
LINE 9: order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice
LINE 10: of, who are accompanied by old Phœnix. They make, each of them, very
LINE 11: moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by
LINE 12: Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phœnix in his tent. The
LINE 13: ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake
LINE 14: themselves to sleep.
LINE 15: This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,
LINE 16: which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The
LINE 17: scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.
LINE 18: Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;
LINE 19: While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,[199]
LINE 20: And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,
LINE 21: Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.
LINE 22: As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,
LINE 23: A double tempest of the west and north
LINE 24: Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,
LINE 25: Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:
LINE 26: This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:
LINE 27: Such various passions urged the troubled host,
LINE 28: Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;
LINE 29: Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;
LINE 30: Himself his orders to the heralds bears,
LINE 31: To bid to council all the Grecian peers,
LINE 32: But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,
LINE 33: In solemn sadness and majestic grief.
LINE 34: The king amidst the mournful circle rose:
LINE 35: Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
LINE 36: So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,
LINE 37: In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.
LINE 38: With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;
LINE 39: Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:
LINE 40: "Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;
LINE 41: Fellows in arms and princes of the war!
LINE 42: Of partial Jove too justly we complain,
LINE 43: And heavenly oracles believed in vain.
LINE 44: A safe return was promised to our toils,
LINE 45: With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:
LINE 46: Now shameful flight alone can save the host;
LINE 47: Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.
LINE 48: So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!
LINE 49: Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,
LINE 50: Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,
LINE 51: And towers and armies humbles to the dust.
LINE 52: Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,
LINE 53: Haste to the joys our native country yields;
LINE 54: Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,
LINE 55: Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."
LINE 56: He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;
LINE 57: Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;
LINE 58: A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son
LINE 59: Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:
LINE 60: "When kings advise us to renounce our fame,
LINE 61: First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.
LINE 62: If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,
LINE 63: The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.
LINE 64: Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,
LINE 65: Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:
LINE 66: Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,
LINE 67: The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.
LINE 68: The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,
LINE 69: The gods have made thee but by halves a king:
LINE 70: They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;
LINE 71: They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;
LINE 72: The noblest power that might the world control
LINE 73: They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.
LINE 74: Is this a general's voice, that would suggest
LINE 75: Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?
LINE 76: Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;
LINE 77: And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.
LINE 78: Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;
LINE 79: Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;
LINE 80: A noble care the Grecians shall employ,
LINE 81: To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.
LINE 82: Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,
LINE 83: Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;
LINE 84: Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;
LINE 85: God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came."
LINE 86: He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,
LINE 87: And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.
LINE 88: Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear'd;
LINE 89: He spoke: the host in still attention heard:[200]
LINE 90: "O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd
LINE 91: Such strength of body with such force of mind:
LINE 92: In conduct, as in courage, you excel,
LINE 93: Still first to act what you advise so well.
LINE 94: These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,
LINE 95: Applauding Greece with common voice approves.
LINE 96: Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:
LINE 97: And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.
LINE 98: And yet those years that since thy birth have run
LINE 99: Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.
LINE 100: Then let me add what yet remains behind,
LINE 101: A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;
LINE 102: Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring
LINE 103: Distaste the people, or offend the king:
LINE 104: "Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,
LINE 105: Unworthy property, unworthy light,
LINE 106: Unfit for public rule, or private care,
LINE 107: That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;
LINE 108: Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,
LINE 109: To tear his country, and his kind destroy!
LINE 110: This night, refresh and fortify thy train;
LINE 111: Between the trench and wall let guards remain:
LINE 112: Be that the duty of the young and bold;
LINE 113: But thou, O king, to council call the old;
LINE 114: Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;
LINE 115: Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.
LINE 116: With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,
LINE 117: For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.
LINE 118: Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,
LINE 119: And such a monarch as can choose the best.
LINE 120: See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,
LINE 121: How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!
LINE 122: Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?
LINE 123: What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?
LINE 124: This dreadful interval determines all;
LINE 125: To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall."
LINE 126: Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;
LINE 127: Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.
LINE 128: His son was first to pass the lofty mound,
LINE 129: The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:
LINE 130: Next him, Ascalaphus, Iälmen, stood,
LINE 131: The double offspring of the warrior-god:
LINE 132: Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,
LINE 133: And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.
LINE 134: Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,
LINE 135: And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.
LINE 136: The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,
LINE 137: Some line the trench, and others man the wall.
LINE 138: The king of men, on public counsels bent,
LINE 139: Convened the princes in his ample tent,
LINE 140: Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,
LINE 141: But stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.
LINE 142: Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,
LINE 143: And slowly rising, thus the council moved.
LINE 144: "Monarch of nations! whose superior sway
LINE 145: Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,
LINE 146: The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,
LINE 147: And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.
LINE 148: O king! the counsels of my age attend;
LINE 149: With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.
LINE 150: Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,
LINE 151: Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,
LINE 152: To see no wholesome motion be withstood,
LINE 153: And ratify the best for public good.
LINE 154: Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,
LINE 155: But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.
LINE 156: Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,
LINE 157: At once my present judgment and my past.
LINE 158: When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,
LINE 159: I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;
LINE 160: But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,
LINE 161: You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:
LINE 162: Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,
LINE 163: With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend."
LINE 164: To whom the king. "With justice hast thou shown
LINE 165: A prince's faults, and I with reason own.
LINE 166: That happy man, whom Jove still honours most,
LINE 167: Is more than armies, and himself a host.
LINE 168: Bless'd in his love, this wondrous hero stands;
LINE 169: Heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.
LINE 170: Fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,
LINE 171: The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.
LINE 172: If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,[201]
LINE 173: Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.
LINE 174: Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
LINE 175: And twice ten vases of refulgent mould:
LINE 176: Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
LINE 177: Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;
LINE 178: Twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,
LINE 179: And still victorious in the dusty course;
LINE 180: (Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed
LINE 181: The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
LINE 182: Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
LINE 183: Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
LINE 184: The same I chose for more than vulgar charms,
LINE 185: When Lesbos sank beneath the hero's arms:
LINE 186: All these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,
LINE 187: And join'd with these the long-contested maid;
LINE 188: With all her charms, Briseïs I resign,
LINE 189: And solemn swear those charms were never mine;
LINE 190: Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
LINE 191: Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,[202]
LINE 192: These instant shall be his; and if the powers
LINE 193: Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,
LINE 194: Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)
LINE 195: With gold and brass his loaded navy's sides:
LINE 196: Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
LINE 197: With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,
LINE 198: Such as himself will choose; who yield to none,
LINE 199: Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.
LINE 200: Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,
LINE 201: If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,
LINE 202: There shall he live my son, our honours share,
LINE 203: And with Orestes' self divide my care.
LINE 204: Yet more—three daughters in my court are bred,
LINE 205: And each well worthy of a royal bed;
LINE 206: Laodice and Iphigenia fair,[203]
LINE 207: And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;
LINE 208: Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,
LINE 209: I ask no presents, no reward for love:
LINE 210: Myself will give the dower; so vast a store
LINE 211: As never father gave a child before.
LINE 212: Seven ample cities shall confess his sway,
LINE 213: Him Enope, and Pheræ him obey,
LINE 214: Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
LINE 215: And sacred Pedasus for vines renown'd;
LINE 216: Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
LINE 217: And rich Antheia with her flowery fields:[204]
LINE 218: The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,
LINE 219: Along the verdant margin of the main.
LINE 220: There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
LINE 221: Bold are the men, and generous is the soil;
LINE 222: There shall he reign, with power and justice crown'd,
LINE 223: And rule the tributary realms around.
LINE 224: All this I give, his vengeance to control,
LINE 225: And sure all this may move his mighty soul.
LINE 226: Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,
LINE 227: Who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,
LINE 228: Lives dark and dreadful in deep hell's abodes,
LINE 229: And mortals hate him, as the worst of gods.
LINE 230: Great though he be, it fits him to obey,
LINE 231: Since more than his my years, and more my sway."
LINE 232: [Illustration: ] PLUTO
LINE 233: The monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:
LINE 234: "Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!
LINE 235: Such are thy offers as a prince may take,
LINE 236: And such as fits a generous king to make.
LINE 237: Let chosen delegates this hour be sent
LINE 238: (Myself will name them) to Pelides' tent.
LINE 239: Let Phœnix lead, revered for hoary age,
LINE 240: Great Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.
LINE 241: Yet more to sanctify the word you send,
LINE 242: Let Hodius and Eurybates attend.
LINE 243: Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;
LINE 244: Pray in deep silence,[205] and with purest hands."[206]
LINE 245: [Illustration: ] THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES
LINE 246: He said; and all approved. The heralds bring
LINE 247: The cleansing water from the living spring.
LINE 248: The youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,
LINE 249: And large libations drench'd the sands around.
LINE 250: The rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,
LINE 251: Then from the royal tent they take their way;
LINE 252: Wise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,
LINE 253: Forbids to offend, instructs them to apply;
LINE 254: Much he advised them all, Ulysses most,
LINE 255: To deprecate the chief, and save the host.
LINE 256: Through the still night they march, and hear the roar
LINE 257: Of murmuring billows on the sounding shore.
LINE 258: To Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,
LINE 259: Whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,
LINE 260: They pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,
LINE 261: And calm the rage of stern Æacides.
LINE 262: And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay
LINE 263: The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;
LINE 264: Amused at ease, the godlike man they found,
LINE 265: Pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.
LINE 266: (The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;
LINE 267: Of polish'd silver was its costly frame.)
LINE 268: With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings
LINE 269: The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.
LINE 270: Patroclus only of the royal train,
LINE 271: Placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain:
LINE 272: Full opposite he sat, and listen'd long,
LINE 273: In silence waiting till he ceased the song.
LINE 274: Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds
LINE 275: To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.
LINE 276: Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,
LINE 277: Leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.
LINE 278: With like surprise arose Menoetius' son:
LINE 279: Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:
LINE 280: "Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.
LINE 281: Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;
LINE 282: Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;
LINE 283: To me more dear than all that bear the name."
LINE 284: With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,
LINE 285: And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.
LINE 286: Then thus—"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,
LINE 287: Mix purer wine, and open every soul.
LINE 288: Of all the warriors yonder host can send,
LINE 289: Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend."
LINE 290: He said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire
LINE 291: Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:
LINE 292: The brazen vase Automedon sustains,
LINE 293: Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.
LINE 294: Achilles at the genial feast presides,
LINE 295: The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.
LINE 296: Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;
LINE 297: The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:
LINE 298: Then, when the languid flames at length subside,
LINE 299: He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,
LINE 300: Above the coals the smoking fragments turns
LINE 301: And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;
LINE 302: With bread the glittering canisters they load,
LINE 303: Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;
LINE 304: Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,
LINE 305: Each portion parts, and orders every rite.
LINE 306: The first fat offering to the immortals due,
LINE 307: Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;
LINE 308: Then each, indulging in the social feast,
LINE 309: His thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.
LINE 310: That done, to Phœnix Ajax gave the sign:
LINE 311: Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine
LINE 312: The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,
LINE 313: His speech addressing to the godlike man.
LINE 314: "Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!
LINE 315: Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:
LINE 316: Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,
LINE 317: That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;
LINE 318: But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,
LINE 319: Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.
LINE 320: What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!
LINE 321: The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;
LINE 322: Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,
LINE 323: And owns no help but from thy saving hands:
LINE 324: Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;
LINE 325: Their threatening tents already shade our wall:
LINE 326: Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,
LINE 327: And point at every ship their vengeful flame!
LINE 328: For them the father of the gods declares,
LINE 329: Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.
LINE 330: See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!
LINE 331: See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;
LINE 332: What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!
LINE 333: He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame
LINE 334: The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.
LINE 335: Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,
LINE 336: Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!
LINE 337: And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay
LINE 338: In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?
LINE 339: Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,
LINE 340: To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;
LINE 341: If in that heart or grief or courage lies,
LINE 342: Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!
LINE 343: The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,
LINE 344: That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:
LINE 345: Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!
LINE 346: Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.
LINE 347: When Peleus in his aged arms embraced
LINE 348: His parting son, these accents were his last:
LINE 349: "'My child! with strength, with glory, and success,
LINE 350: Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!
LINE 351: Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage
LINE 352: To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:
LINE 353: From gentler manners let thy glory grow,
LINE 354: And shun contention, the sure source of woe;
LINE 355: That young and old may in thy praise combine,
LINE 356: The virtues of humanity be thine—'
LINE 357: This now-despised advice thy father gave;
LINE 358: Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.
LINE 359: If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers,
LINE 360: Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;
LINE 361: If not—but hear me, while I number o'er
LINE 362: The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.
LINE 363: Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
LINE 364: And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;
LINE 365: Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
LINE 366: Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;
LINE 367: Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,
LINE 368: And still victorious in the dusty course;
LINE 369: (Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed
LINE 370: The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
LINE 371: Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
LINE 372: Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
LINE 373: The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,
LINE 374: When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.
LINE 375: All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,
LINE 376: And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid;
LINE 377: With all her charms, Briseïs he'll resign,
LINE 378: And solemn swear those charms were only thine;
LINE 379: Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
LINE 380: Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
LINE 381: These instant shall be thine; and if the powers
LINE 382: Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,
LINE 383: Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)
LINE 384: With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.
LINE 385: Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
LINE 386: With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;
LINE 387: Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,
LINE 388: Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.
LINE 389: Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,
LINE 390: If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,
LINE 391: There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,
LINE 392: And with Orestes' self divide his care.
LINE 393: Yet more—three daughters in his court are bred,
LINE 394: And each well worthy of a royal bed:
LINE 395: Laodice and Iphigenia fair,
LINE 396: And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:
LINE 397: Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;
LINE 398: He asks no presents, no reward for love:
LINE 399: Himself will give the dower; so vast a store
LINE 400: As never father gave a child before.
LINE 401: Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,
LINE 402: The Enope and Pheræ thee obey,
LINE 403: Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
LINE 404: And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:
LINE 405: Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
LINE 406: And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;
LINE 407: The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,
LINE 408: Along the verdant margin of the main.
LINE 409: There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
LINE 410: Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.
LINE 411: There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,
LINE 412: And rule the tributary realms around.
LINE 413: Such are the proffers which this day we bring,
LINE 414: Such the repentance of a suppliant king.
LINE 415: But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,
LINE 416: If honour and if interest plead in vain,
LINE 417: Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,
LINE 418: And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.
LINE 419: If no regard thy suffering country claim,
LINE 420: Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:
LINE 421: For now that chief, whose unresisted ire
LINE 422: Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,
LINE 423: Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,
LINE 424: And only triumphs to deserve thy hands."
LINE 425: Then thus the goddess-born: "Ulysses, hear
LINE 426: A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;
LINE 427: What in my secret soul is understood,
LINE 428: My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.
LINE 429: Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:
LINE 430: Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.
LINE 431: Who dares think one thing, and another tell,
LINE 432: My heart detests him as the gates of hell.
LINE 433: "Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,
LINE 434: Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;
LINE 435: Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,
LINE 436: But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.
LINE 437: Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,
LINE 438: The wretch and hero find their prize the same.
LINE 439: Alike regretted in the dust he lies,
LINE 440: Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.
LINE 441: Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,
LINE 442: A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?
LINE 443: As the bold bird her helpless young attends,
LINE 444: From danger guards them, and from want defends;
LINE 445: In search of prey she wings the spacious air,
LINE 446: And with the untasted food supplies her care:
LINE 447: For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,
LINE 448: Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;
LINE 449: Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,
LINE 450: And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.
LINE 451: I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,[207]
LINE 452: And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:
LINE 453: Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid
LINE 454: The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.
LINE 455: Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;
LINE 456: Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.
LINE 457: Some present, too, to every prince was paid;
LINE 458: And every prince enjoys the gift he made:
LINE 459: I only must refund, of all his train;
LINE 460: See what pre-eminence our merits gain!
LINE 461: My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:
LINE 462: My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:
LINE 463: The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;
LINE 464: But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?
LINE 465: What to these shores the assembled nations draws,
LINE 466: What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?
LINE 467: Are fair endowments and a beauteous face
LINE 468: Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?
LINE 469: The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,
LINE 470: Sure every wise and worthy man will love.
LINE 471: Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;
LINE 472: Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.
LINE 473: Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;
LINE 474: Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.
LINE 475: Ye have my answer—what remains to do,
LINE 476: Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.
LINE 477: What needs he the defence this arm can make?
LINE 478: Has he not walls no human force can shake?
LINE 479: Has he not fenced his guarded navy round
LINE 480: With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?
LINE 481: And will not these (the wonders he has done)
LINE 482: Repel the rage of Priam's single son?
LINE 483: There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)
LINE 484: When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;
LINE 485: He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait
LINE 486: Achilles' fury at the Scæan gate;
LINE 487: He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.
LINE 488: But now those ancient enmities are o'er;
LINE 489: To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;
LINE 490: Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,
LINE 491: And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.
LINE 492: The third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,[208]
LINE 493: If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;
LINE 494: Pythia to her Achilles shall restore
LINE 495: The wealth he left for this detested shore:
LINE 496: Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,
LINE 497: The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:
LINE 498: My beauteous captives thither I'll convey,
LINE 499: And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.
LINE 500: One only valued gift your tyrant gave,
LINE 501: And that resumed—the fair Lyrnessian slave.
LINE 502: Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,
LINE 503: And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;
LINE 504: (For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,
LINE 505: And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;
LINE 506: Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes
LINE 507: Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)
LINE 508: Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,
LINE 509: Nor share his council, nor his battle join;
LINE 510: For once deceiv'd, was his; but twice were mine,
LINE 511: No—let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives
LINE 512: Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;
LINE 513: His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind
LINE 514: Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,
LINE 515: Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,
LINE 516: And all his rapine could from others wrest:
LINE 517: Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown
LINE 518: The many-peopled Orchomenian town;[209]
LINE 519: Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,
LINE 520: The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain
LINE 521: (That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,
LINE 522: And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,
LINE 523: Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars
LINE 524: From each wide portal issuing to the wars);[210]
LINE 525: Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more
LINE 526: Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;
LINE 527: Should all these offers for my friendship call,
LINE 528: 'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.
LINE 529: Atrides' daughter never shall be led
LINE 530: (An ill-match'd consort) to Achilles' bed;
LINE 531: Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart,
LINE 532: And vied with Pallas in the works of art;
LINE 533: Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,
LINE 534: I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.
LINE 535: If heaven restore me to my realms with life,
LINE 536: The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;
LINE 537: Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,
LINE 538: And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.
LINE 539: Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,
LINE 540: Content with just hereditary sway;
LINE 541: There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,
LINE 542: Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.
LINE 543: Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.
LINE 544: Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,
LINE 545: Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,
LINE 546: Can bribe the poor possession of a day!
LINE 547: Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,
LINE 548: And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain:
LINE 549: But from our lips the vital spirit fled,
LINE 550: Returns no more to wake the silent dead.
LINE 551: My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,
LINE 552: And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;
LINE 553: Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,
LINE 554: Short is my date, but deathless my renown:
LINE 555: If I return, I quit immortal praise
LINE 556: For years on years, and long-extended days.
LINE 557: Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,
LINE 558: And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;
LINE 559: To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,
LINE 560: Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.
LINE 561: Jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!
LINE 562: Her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.
LINE 563: Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design;
LINE 564: Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,
LINE 565: Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,
LINE 566: To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.
LINE 567: One stratagem has fail'd, and others will:
LINE 568: Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.
LINE 569: Go then—digest my message as ye may—
LINE 570: But here this night let reverend Phœnix stay:
LINE 571: His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand
LINE 572: A peaceful death in Pythia's friendly land.
LINE 573: But whether he remain or sail with me,
LINE 574: His age be sacred, and his will be free."
LINE 575: [Illustration: ] GREEK GALLEY
LINE 576: The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around
LINE 577: In silence wrapt, in consternation drown'd,
LINE 578: Attend the stern reply. Then Phœnix rose;
LINE 579: (Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)
LINE 580: And while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn'd,
LINE 581: With accent weak these tender words return'd.
LINE 582: [Illustration: ] PROSERPINE
LINE 583: "Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,
LINE 584: And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?
LINE 585: If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,
LINE 586: How shall thy friend, thy Phœnix, stay behind?
LINE 587: The royal Peleus, when from Pythia's coast
LINE 588: He sent thee early to the Achaian host;
LINE 589: Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,
LINE 590: And new to perils of the direful field:
LINE 591: He bade me teach thee all the ways of war,
LINE 592: To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.
LINE 593: Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!
LINE 594: No time shall part us, and no fate divide,
LINE 595: Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore
LINE 596: The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,
LINE 597: When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames
LINE 598: (Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),
LINE 599: My father faithless to my mother's arms,
LINE 600: Old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.
LINE 601: I tried what youth could do (at her desire)
LINE 602: To win the damsel, and prevent my sire.
LINE 603: My sire with curses loads my hated head,
LINE 604: And cries, 'Ye furies! barren be his bed.'
LINE 605: Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,
LINE 606: And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow.
LINE 607: Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!
LINE 608: Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!
LINE 609: I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)
LINE 610: To plunge the poniard in my father's breast;
LINE 611: Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain
LINE 612: With prayers entreat me, and with force detain.
LINE 613: On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,
LINE 614: They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;
LINE 615: Strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire;
LINE 616: The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.
LINE 617: The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:
LINE 618: And, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,
LINE 619: My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;
LINE 620: In Phthia's court at last my labours end.
LINE 621: Your sire received me, as his son caress'd,
LINE 622: With gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.
LINE 623: The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,
LINE 624: And all the coast that runs along the main.
LINE 625: By love to thee his bounties I repaid,
LINE 626: And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:
LINE 627: Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:
LINE 628: A child I took thee, but a hero gave.
LINE 629: Thy infant breast a like affection show'd;
LINE 630: Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)
LINE 631: Or at my knee, by Phœnix wouldst thou stand;
LINE 632: No food was grateful but from Phœnix' hand.[211]
LINE 633: I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,
LINE 634: The tender labours, the compliant cares,
LINE 635: The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,
LINE 636: And Phœnix felt a father's joys in thee:
LINE 637: Thy growing virtues justified my cares,
LINE 638: And promised comfort to my silver hairs.
LINE 639: Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;
LINE 640: A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:
LINE 641: The gods (the only great, and only wise)
LINE 642: Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;
LINE 643: Offending man their high compassion wins,
LINE 644: And daily prayers atone for daily sins.
LINE 645: Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,
LINE 646: Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;
LINE 647: With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,
LINE 648: Constant they follow, where injustice flies.
LINE 649: Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,
LINE 650: Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,
LINE 651: While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.
LINE 652: Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,
LINE 653: For him they mediate to the throne above:
LINE 654: When man rejects the humble suit they make,
LINE 655: The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;
LINE 656: From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then
LINE 657: Descends to punish unrelenting men.
LINE 658: O let not headlong passion bear the sway
LINE 659: These reconciling goddesses obey:
LINE 660: Due honours to the seed of Jove belong,
LINE 661: Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.
LINE 662: Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,
LINE 663: Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;
LINE 664: Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage
LINE 665: Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.
LINE 666: But since what honour asks the general sends,
LINE 667: And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;
LINE 668: The best and noblest of the Grecian train;
LINE 669: Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!
LINE 670: Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,
LINE 671: A great example drawn from times of old;
LINE 672: Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,
LINE 673: Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.
LINE 674: "Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands[212]
LINE 675: Once fought the Ætolian and Curetian bands;
LINE 676: To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;
LINE 677: And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
LINE 678: The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,
LINE 679: In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;
LINE 680: On Œneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,
LINE 681: That levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:
LINE 682: This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)
LINE 683: Great Meleager stretch'd along the plain,
LINE 684: Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,
LINE 685: The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.
LINE 686: Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,
LINE 687: While Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:
LINE 688: Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast
LINE 689: (For rage invades the wisest and the best).
LINE 690: "Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,
LINE 691: And in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.
LINE 692: (She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,
LINE 693: And matchless Idas, more than man in war:
LINE 694: The god of day adored the mother's charms;
LINE 695: Against the god the father bent his arms:
LINE 696: The afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,
LINE 697: From Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,
LINE 698: And call'd Alcyone; a name to show
LINE 699: The father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)
LINE 700: To her the chief retired from stern debate,
LINE 701: But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:
LINE 702: Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,
LINE 703: Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;
LINE 704: She beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath
LINE 705: On her own son to wreak her brother's death;
LINE 706: Hell heard her curses from the realms profound,
LINE 707: And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.
LINE 708: In vain Ætolia her deliverer waits,
LINE 709: War shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.
LINE 710: She sent ambassadors, a chosen band,
LINE 711: Priests of the gods, and elders of the land;
LINE 712: Besought the chief to save the sinking state:
LINE 713: Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:
LINE 714: (Full fifty acres of the richest ground,
LINE 715: Half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)
LINE 716: His suppliant father, aged Œneus, came;
LINE 717: His sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,
LINE 718: Althaea, sues; his friends before him fall:
LINE 719: He stands relentless, and rejects them all.
LINE 720: Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;
LINE 721: The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;
LINE 722: At length his wife (a form divine) appears,
LINE 723: With piercing cries, and supplicating tears;
LINE 724: She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,
LINE 725: The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,
LINE 726: The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:
LINE 727: The warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.
LINE 728: The Ætolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,
LINE 729: And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.
LINE 730: Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,
LINE 731: Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;
LINE 732: Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;
LINE 733: And be amongst our guardian gods adored."
LINE 734: Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:
LINE 735: "My second father, and my reverend guide:
LINE 736: Thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,
LINE 737: And asks no honours from a mortal's hands;
LINE 738: Jove honours me, and favours my designs;
LINE 739: His pleasure guides me, and his will confines;
LINE 740: And here I stay (if such his high behest)
LINE 741: While life's warm spirit beats within my breast.
LINE 742: Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:
LINE 743: No more molest me on Atrides' part:
LINE 744: Is it for him these tears are taught to flow,
LINE 745: For him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?
LINE 746: A generous friendship no cold medium knows,
LINE 747: Burns with one love, with one resentment glows;
LINE 748: One should our interests and our passions be;
LINE 749: My friend must hate the man that injures me.
LINE 750: Do this, my Phœnix, 'tis a generous part;
LINE 751: And share my realms, my honours, and my heart.
LINE 752: Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,
LINE 753: Rest undetermined till the dawning day."
LINE 754: He ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed
LINE 755: A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.
LINE 756: With that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,
LINE 757: And thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:
LINE 758: "Hence let us go—why waste we time in vain?
LINE 759: See what effect our low submissions gain!
LINE 760: Liked or not liked, his words we must relate,
LINE 761: The Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.
LINE 762: Proud as he is, that iron heart retains
LINE 763: Its stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.
LINE 764: Stern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,
LINE 765: On just atonement, we remit the deed;
LINE 766: A sire the slaughter of his son forgives;
LINE 767: The price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:
LINE 768: The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,
LINE 769: And gifts can conquer every soul but thine.[213]
LINE 770: The gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,
LINE 771: And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.
LINE 772: One woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:
LINE 773: Lo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.
LINE 774: Then hear, Achilles! be of better mind;
LINE 775: Revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;
LINE 776: And know the men of all the Grecian host,
LINE 777: Who honour worth, and prize thy valour most."
LINE 778: "O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!
LINE 779: (To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)
LINE 780: Well hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name
LINE 781: My rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:
LINE 782: 'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:
LINE 783: Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!
LINE 784: Return, then, heroes! and our answer bear,
LINE 785: The glorious combat is no more my care;
LINE 786: Not till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,
LINE 787: The blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;
LINE 788: Not till the flames, by Hector's fury thrown,
LINE 789: Consume your vessels, and approach my own;
LINE 790: Just there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,
LINE 791: There cease his battle, and there feel our hand."
LINE 792: This said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,
LINE 793: And cast a large libation on the ground;
LINE 794: Then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,
LINE 795: The chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.
LINE 796: Meantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,
LINE 797: With fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:
LINE 798: There, till the sacred morn restored the day,
LINE 799: In slumber sweet the reverend Phœnix lay.
LINE 800: But in his inner tent, an ampler space,
LINE 801: Achilles slept; and in his warm embrace
LINE 802: Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race.
LINE 803: Last, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,
LINE 804: Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;
LINE 805: Achilles to his friend consign'd her charms
LINE 806: When Scyros fell before his conquering arms.
LINE 807: And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,
LINE 808: Pass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.
LINE 809: Then rising all, with goblets in their hands,
LINE 810: The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands
LINE 811: Hail'd their return: Atrides first begun:
LINE 812: "Say what success? divine Laertes' son!
LINE 813: Achilles' high resolves declare to all:
LINE 814: Returns the chief, or must our navy fall?"
LINE 815: "Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)
LINE 816: Fix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride;
LINE 817: He slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,
LINE 818: And, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.
LINE 819: To save our army, and our fleets to free,
LINE 820: Is not his care; but left to Greece and thee.
LINE 821: Your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,
LINE 822: Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;
LINE 823: Us too he bids our oars and sails employ,
LINE 824: Nor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;
LINE 825: For Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,
LINE 826: Inspires her war, and bids her glory shine.
LINE 827: Such was his word: what further he declared,
LINE 828: These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.
LINE 829: But Phœnix in his tent the chief retains,
LINE 830: Safe to transport him to his native plains
LINE 831: When morning dawns; if other he decree,
LINE 832: His age is sacred, and his choice is free."
LINE 833: Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian host,
LINE 834: With sorrow seized, in consternation lost,
LINE 835: Attend the stern reply. Tydides broke
LINE 836: The general silence, and undaunted spoke.
LINE 837: "Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,
LINE 838: Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?
LINE 839: His country's woes he glories to deride,
LINE 840: And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.
LINE 841: Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey'd,
LINE 842: Our battles let him or desert or aid;
LINE 843: Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:
LINE 844: That, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:
LINE 845: What for ourselves we can, is always ours;
LINE 846: This night, let due repast refresh our powers;
LINE 847: (For strength consists in spirits and in blood,
LINE 848: And those are owed to generous wine and food;)
LINE 849: But when the rosy messenger of day
LINE 850: Strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,
LINE 851: Ranged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine
LINE 852: In flaming arms, a long-extended line:
LINE 853: In the dread front let great Atrides stand,
LINE 854: The first in danger, as in high command."
LINE 855: Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,
LINE 856: Then each to Heaven the due libations pays;
LINE 857: Till sleep, descending o'er the tents, bestows
LINE 858: The grateful blessings of desired repose.[214]
