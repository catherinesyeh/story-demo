LINE 1: In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
LINE 2: towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and
LINE 3: Briseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.
LINE 4: Chryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of Apollo, comes to the
LINE 5: Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in
LINE 6: the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently
LINE 7: dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who
LINE 8: inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and
LINE 9: encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the
LINE 10: refusal of Chryseïs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,
LINE 11: enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;
LINE 12: however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on
LINE 13: Briseïs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his
LINE 14: forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she
LINE 15: supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her
LINE 16: son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,
LINE 17: incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are
LINE 18: reconciled by the address of Vulcan.
LINE 19: The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine
LINE 20: during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes,
LINE 21: and twelve for Jupiter's stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return
LINE 22: Thetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp,
LINE 23: then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.
LINE 24: Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
LINE 25: Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
LINE 26: That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign
LINE 27: The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
LINE 28: Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
LINE 29: Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.[41]
LINE 30: Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
LINE 31: Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove![42]
LINE 32: Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour[43]
LINE 33: Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
LINE 34: Latona's son a dire contagion spread,[44]
LINE 35: And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;
LINE 36: The king of men his reverent priest defied,[45]
LINE 37: And for the king's offence the people died.
LINE 38: For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
LINE 39: His captive daughter from the victor's chain.
LINE 40: Suppliant the venerable father stands;
LINE 41: Apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands:
LINE 42: By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
LINE 43: Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.
LINE 44: He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
LINE 45: The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race[46]
LINE 46: "Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,
LINE 47: And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
LINE 48: May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er
LINE 49: Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
LINE 50: But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,
LINE 51: And give Chryseïs to these arms again;
LINE 52: If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
LINE 53: And dread avenging Phœbus, son of Jove."
LINE 54: The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
LINE 55: The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
LINE 56: Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
LINE 57: Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:
LINE 58: "Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
LINE 59: Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:
LINE 60: Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
LINE 61: Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
LINE 62: Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
LINE 63: And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
LINE 64: Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
LINE 65: And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
LINE 66: In daily labours of the loom employ'd,
LINE 67: Or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd.
LINE 68: Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
LINE 69: Far from her native soil and weeping sire."
LINE 70: [Illustration: ] HOMER INVOKING THE MUSE
LINE 71: The trembling priest along the shore return'd,
LINE 72: And in the anguish of a father mourn'd.
LINE 73: Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
LINE 74: Silent he wander'd by the sounding main;
LINE 75: Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
LINE 76: The god who darts around the world his rays.
LINE 77: "O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona's line,[47]
LINE 78: Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,[48]
LINE 79: Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
LINE 80: And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa's shores.
LINE 81: If e'er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,[49]
LINE 82: Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
LINE 83: God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
LINE 84: Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy."
LINE 85: Thus Chryses pray'd:—the favouring power attends,
LINE 86: And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.
LINE 87: Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;[50]
LINE 88: Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
LINE 89: Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
LINE 90: And gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.
LINE 91: The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,
LINE 92: And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.
LINE 93: On mules and dogs the infection first began;[51]
LINE 94: And last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.
LINE 95: For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
LINE 96: The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
LINE 97: But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
LINE 98: Inspired by Juno, Thetis' godlike son
LINE 99: Convened to council all the Grecian train;
LINE 100: For much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.[52]
LINE 101: The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
LINE 102: Achilles thus the king of men address'd:
LINE 103: "Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
LINE 104: And measure back the seas we cross'd before?
LINE 105: The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
LINE 106: 'Tis time to save the few remains of war.
LINE 107: But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
LINE 108: Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage;
LINE 109: Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
LINE 110: By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.[53]
LINE 111: If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
LINE 112: Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
LINE 113: So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
LINE 114: And Phœbus dart his burning shafts no more."
LINE 115: He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
LINE 116: Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
LINE 117: That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
LINE 118: The past, the present, and the future knew:
LINE 119: Uprising slow, the venerable sage
LINE 120: Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:
LINE 121: "Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would'st thou know
LINE 122: Why angry Phœbus bends his fatal bow?
LINE 123: First give thy faith, and plight a prince's word
LINE 124: Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
LINE 125: For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
LINE 126: And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
LINE 127: Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
LINE 128: Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
LINE 129: For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
LINE 130: 'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."
LINE 131: To whom Pelides:—"From thy inmost soul
LINE 132: Speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.
LINE 133: E'en by that god I swear who rules the day,
LINE 134: To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
LINE 135: And whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;
LINE 136: Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
LINE 137: No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
LINE 138: Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
LINE 139: Not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
LINE 140: The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."
LINE 141: Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
LINE 142: "Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
LINE 143: But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
LINE 144: Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.
LINE 145: Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,
LINE 146: But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
LINE 147: Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
LINE 148: To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.[54]
LINE 149: Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
LINE 150: The priest may pardon, and the god may spare."
LINE 151: The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
LINE 152: The monarch started from his shining throne;
LINE 153: Black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,
LINE 154: And from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:
LINE 155: "Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
LINE 156: Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
LINE 157: Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
LINE 158: And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
LINE 159: For this are Phœbus' oracles explored,
LINE 160: To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
LINE 161: For this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,
LINE 162: Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
LINE 163: Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
LINE 164: And heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?
LINE 165: A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,
LINE 166: Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;
LINE 167: Not half so dear were Clytæmnestra's charms,
LINE 168: When first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.
LINE 169: Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
LINE 170: Our cares are only for the public weal:
LINE 171: Let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,
LINE 172: And suffer, rather than my people fall.
LINE 173: The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
LINE 174: So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
LINE 175: But since for common good I yield the fair,
LINE 176: My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
LINE 177: Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
LINE 178: That he alone has fought and bled in vain."
LINE 179: "Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
LINE 180: Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
LINE 181: Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
LINE 182: The due reward of many a well-fought field?
LINE 183: The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
LINE 184: We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
LINE 185: But to resume whate'er thy avarice craves
LINE 186: (That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
LINE 187: Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
LINE 188: The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
LINE 189: Whene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers
LINE 190: Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers."
LINE 191: Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign
LINE 192: With tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?
LINE 193: Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
LINE 194: Think not to rob me of a soldier's right.
LINE 195: At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
LINE 196: First let the just equivalent be paid;
LINE 197: Such as a king might ask; and let it be
LINE 198: A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
LINE 199: Or grant me this, or with a monarch's claim
LINE 200: This hand shall seize some other captive dame.
LINE 201: The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;[55]
LINE 202: Ulysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
LINE 203: The man who suffers, loudly may complain;
LINE 204: And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
LINE 205: But this when time requires.—It now remains
LINE 206: We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
LINE 207: And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,
LINE 208: With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
LINE 209: Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
LINE 210: And some deputed prince the charge attend:
LINE 211: This Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,
LINE 212: Or wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;
LINE 213: Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
LINE 214: Achilles' self conduct her o'er the main;
LINE 215: Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,
LINE 216: The god propitiate, and the pest assuage."
LINE 217: [Illustration: ] MARS
LINE 218: At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:
LINE 219: "O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!
LINE 220: Inglorious slave to interest, ever join'd
LINE 221: With fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!
LINE 222: What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,
LINE 223: Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
LINE 224: What cause have I to war at thy decree?
LINE 225: The distant Trojans never injured me;
LINE 226: To Phthia's realms no hostile troops they led:
LINE 227: Safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;
LINE 228: Far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,
LINE 229: And walls of rocks, secure my native reign,
LINE 230: Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
LINE 231: Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
LINE 232: Hither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,
LINE 233: To avenge a private, not a public wrong:
LINE 234: What else to Troy the assembled nations draws,
LINE 235: But thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?
LINE 236: Is this the pay our blood and toils deserve;
LINE 237: Disgraced and injured by the man we serve?
LINE 238: And darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,
LINE 239: Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?
LINE 240: A prize as small, O tyrant! match'd with thine,
LINE 241: As thy own actions if compared to mine.
LINE 242: Thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,
LINE 243: Though mine the sweat and danger of the day.
LINE 244: Some trivial present to my ships I bear:
LINE 245: Or barren praises pay the wounds of war.
LINE 246: But know, proud monarch, I'm thy slave no more;
LINE 247: My fleet shall waft me to Thessalia's shore:
LINE 248: Left by Achilles on the Trojan plain,
LINE 249: What spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?"
LINE 250: To this the king: "Fly, mighty warrior! fly;
LINE 251: Thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.
LINE 252: There want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,
LINE 253: And Jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.
LINE 254: Of all the kings (the god's distinguish'd care)
LINE 255: To power superior none such hatred bear:
LINE 256: Strife and debate thy restless soul employ,
LINE 257: And wars and horrors are thy savage joy,
LINE 258: If thou hast strength, 'twas Heaven that strength bestow'd;
LINE 259: For know, vain man! thy valour is from God.
LINE 260: Haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;
LINE 261: Rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;
LINE 262: I heed thee not, but prize at equal rate
LINE 263: Thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.
LINE 264: Go, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:—but here[56]
LINE 265: 'Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.
LINE 266: Know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,
LINE 267: My bark shall waft her to her native land;
LINE 268: But then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,
LINE 269: Fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:
LINE 270: Even in thy tent I'll seize the blooming prize,
LINE 271: Thy loved Briseïs with the radiant eyes.
LINE 272: Hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour
LINE 273: Thou stood'st a rival of imperial power;
LINE 274: And hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,
LINE 275: That kings are subject to the gods alone."
LINE 276: Achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress'd,
LINE 277: His heart swell'd high, and labour'd in his breast;
LINE 278: Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;
LINE 279: Now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool'd:
LINE 280: That prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,
LINE 281: Force through the Greeks, and pierce their haughty lord;
LINE 282: This whispers soft his vengeance to control,
LINE 283: And calm the rising tempest of his soul.
LINE 284: Just as in anguish of suspense he stay'd,
LINE 285: While half unsheathed appear'd the glittering blade,[57]
LINE 286: Minerva swift descended from above,
LINE 287: Sent by the sister and the wife of Jove
LINE 288: (For both the princes claim'd her equal care);
LINE 289: Behind she stood, and by the golden hair
LINE 290: Achilles seized; to him alone confess'd;
LINE 291: A sable cloud conceal'd her from the rest.
LINE 292: He sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,
LINE 293: Known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:
LINE 294: [Illustration: ] MINERVA REPRESSING THE FURY OF ACHILLES
LINE 295: "Descends Minerva, in her guardian care,
LINE 296: A heavenly witness of the wrongs I bear
LINE 297: From Atreus' son?—Then let those eyes that view
LINE 298: The daring crime, behold the vengeance too."
LINE 299: "Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)
LINE 300: To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:
LINE 301: Let great Achilles, to the gods resign'd,
LINE 302: To reason yield the empire o'er his mind.
LINE 303: By awful Juno this command is given;
LINE 304: The king and you are both the care of heaven.
LINE 305: The force of keen reproaches let him feel;
LINE 306: But sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.
LINE 307: For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)
LINE 308: Thy injured honour has its fated hour,
LINE 309: When the proud monarch shall thy arms implore,
LINE 310: And bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.
LINE 311: Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;
LINE 312: Command thy passions, and the gods obey."
LINE 313: To her Pelides:—"With regardful ear,
LINE 314: 'Tis just, O goddess! I thy dictates hear.
LINE 315: Hard as it is, my vengeance I suppress:
LINE 316: Those who revere the gods the gods will bless."
LINE 317: He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid;
LINE 318: Then in the sheath return'd the shining blade.
LINE 319: The goddess swift to high Olympus flies,
LINE 320: And joins the sacred senate of the skies.
LINE 321: Nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,
LINE 322: Which thus redoubling on Atrides broke:
LINE 323: "O monster! mix'd of insolence and fear,
LINE 324: Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!
LINE 325: When wert thou known in ambush'd fights to dare,
LINE 326: Or nobly face the horrid front of war?
LINE 327: 'Tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try;
LINE 328: Thine to look on, and bid the valiant die:
LINE 329: So much 'tis safer through the camp to go,
LINE 330: And rob a subject, than despoil a foe.
LINE 331: Scourge of thy people, violent and base!
LINE 332: Sent in Jove's anger on a slavish race;
LINE 333: Who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,
LINE 334: Are tamed to wrongs;—or this had been thy last.
LINE 335: Now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,
LINE 336: Which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,
LINE 337: Which sever'd from the trunk (as I from thee)
LINE 338: On the bare mountains left its parent tree;
LINE 339: This sceptre, form'd by temper'd steel to prove
LINE 340: An ensign of the delegates of Jove,
LINE 341: From whom the power of laws and justice springs
LINE 342: (Tremendous oath! inviolate to kings);
LINE 343: By this I swear:—when bleeding Greece again
LINE 344: Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain.
LINE 345: When, flush'd with slaughter, Hector comes to spread
LINE 346: The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,
LINE 347: Then shalt thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,
LINE 348: Forced to deplore when impotent to save:
LINE 349: Then rage in bitterness of soul to know
LINE 350: This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe."
LINE 351: He spoke; and furious hurl'd against the ground
LINE 352: His sceptre starr'd with golden studs around:
LINE 353: Then sternly silent sat. With like disdain
LINE 354: The raging king return'd his frowns again.
LINE 355: To calm their passion with the words of age,
LINE 356: Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,
LINE 357: Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill'd;
LINE 358: Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill'd:[58]
LINE 359: Two generations now had pass'd away,
LINE 360: Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;
LINE 361: Two ages o'er his native realm he reign'd,
LINE 362: And now the example of the third remain'd.
LINE 363: All view'd with awe the venerable man;
LINE 364: Who thus with mild benevolence began:—
LINE 365: "What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy
LINE 366: To Troy's proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!
LINE 367: That adverse gods commit to stern debate
LINE 368: The best, the bravest, of the Grecian state.
LINE 369: Young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,
LINE 370: Nor think your Nestor's years and wisdom vain.
LINE 371: A godlike race of heroes once I knew,
LINE 372: Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!
LINE 373: Lives there a chief to match Pirithous' fame,
LINE 374: Dryas the bold, or Ceneus' deathless name;
LINE 375: Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,
LINE 376: Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?
LINE 377: With these of old, to toils of battle bred,
LINE 378: In early youth my hardy days I led;
LINE 379: Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,
LINE 380: And smit with love of honourable deeds,
LINE 381: Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,
LINE 382: Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters' gore,
LINE 383: And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:
LINE 384: Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway'd;
LINE 385: When Nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd.
LINE 386: If in my youth, even these esteem'd me wise;
LINE 387: Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.
LINE 388: Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;
LINE 389: That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:
LINE 390: Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;
LINE 391: Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.
LINE 392: Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,
LINE 393: Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;
LINE 394: Him, awful majesty exalts above
LINE 395: The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.
LINE 396: Let both unite with well-consenting mind,
LINE 397: So shall authority with strength be join'd.
LINE 398: Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles' rage;
LINE 399: Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.
LINE 400: Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,
LINE 401: The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host."
LINE 402: This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:
LINE 403: "Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
LINE 404: But that imperious, that unconquer'd soul,
LINE 405: No laws can limit, no respect control.
LINE 406: Before his pride must his superiors fall;
LINE 407: His word the law, and he the lord of all?
LINE 408: Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?
LINE 409: What king can bear a rival in his sway?
LINE 410: Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;
LINE 411: Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?"
LINE 412: Here on the monarch's speech Achilles broke,
LINE 413: And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:
LINE 414: "Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,
LINE 415: To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,
LINE 416: Should I submit to each unjust decree:—
LINE 417: Command thy vassals, but command not me.
LINE 418: Seize on Briseïs, whom the Grecians doom'd
LINE 419: My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;
LINE 420: And seize secure; no more Achilles draws
LINE 421: His conquering sword in any woman's cause.
LINE 422: The gods command me to forgive the past:
LINE 423: But let this first invasion be the last:
LINE 424: For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,
LINE 425: Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade."
LINE 426: At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:
LINE 427: The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.
LINE 428: Achilles with Patroclus took his way
LINE 429: Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.
LINE 430: Meantime Atrides launch'd with numerous oars
LINE 431: A well-rigg'd ship for Chrysa's sacred shores:
LINE 432: High on the deck was fair Chryseïs placed,
LINE 433: And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:
LINE 434: Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow'd,
LINE 435: Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.
LINE 436: The host to expiate next the king prepares,
LINE 437: With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.
LINE 438: Wash'd by the briny wave, the pious train[59]
LINE 439: Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.
LINE 440: Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,
LINE 441: And bulls and goats to Phœbus' altars paid;
LINE 442: The sable fumes in curling spires arise,
LINE 443: And waft their grateful odours to the skies.
LINE 444: The army thus in sacred rites engaged,
LINE 445: Atrides still with deep resentment raged.
LINE 446: To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,
LINE 447: Talthybius and Eurybates the good.
LINE 448: "Haste to the fierce Achilles' tent (he cries),
LINE 449: Thence bear Briseïs as our royal prize:
LINE 450: Submit he must; or if they will not part,
LINE 451: Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart."
LINE 452: The unwilling heralds act their lord's commands;
LINE 453: Pensive they walk along the barren sands:
LINE 454: Arrived, the hero in his tent they find,
LINE 455: With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.
LINE 456: At awful distance long they silent stand,
LINE 457: Loth to advance, and speak their hard command;
LINE 458: Decent confusion! This the godlike man
LINE 459: Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:
LINE 460: "With leave and honour enter our abodes,
LINE 461: Ye sacred ministers of men and gods![60]
LINE 462: I know your message; by constraint you came;
LINE 463: Not you, but your imperious lord I blame.
LINE 464: Patroclus, haste, the fair Briseïs bring;
LINE 465: Conduct my captive to the haughty king.
LINE 466: But witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,
LINE 467: Witness to gods above, and men below!
LINE 468: But first, and loudest, to your prince declare
LINE 469: (That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),
LINE 470: Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain,
LINE 471: Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:
LINE 472: The raging chief in frantic passion lost,
LINE 473: Blind to himself, and useless to his host,
LINE 474: Unskill'd to judge the future by the past,
LINE 475: In blood and slaughter shall repent at last."
LINE 476: [Illustration: ] THE DEPARTURE OF BRISEIS FROM THE TENT OF ACHILLES
LINE 477: Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;
LINE 478: She, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,
LINE 479: Pass'd silent, as the heralds held her hand,
LINE 480: And oft look'd back, slow-moving o'er the strand.
LINE 481: Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;
LINE 482: But sad, retiring to the sounding shore,
LINE 483: O'er the wild margin of the deep he hung,
LINE 484: That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:[61]
LINE 485: There bathed in tears of anger and disdain,
LINE 486: Thus loud lamented to the stormy main:
LINE 487: "O parent goddess! since in early bloom
LINE 488: Thy son must fall, by too severe a doom;
LINE 489: Sure to so short a race of glory born,
LINE 490: Great Jove in justice should this span adorn:
LINE 491: Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;
LINE 492: And ill he pays the promise of a god,
LINE 493: If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,
LINE 494: Obscures my glories, and resumes my prize."
LINE 495: Far from the deep recesses of the main,
LINE 496: Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign,
LINE 497: The goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;
LINE 498: And like a mist she rose above the tide;
LINE 499: Beheld him mourning on the naked shores,
LINE 500: And thus the sorrows of his soul explores.
LINE 501: "Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;
LINE 502: Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."
LINE 503: He deeply sighing said: "To tell my woe
LINE 504: Is but to mention what too well you know.
LINE 505: From Thebé, sacred to Apollo's name[62]
LINE 506: (Aëtion's realm), our conquering army came,
LINE 507: With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,
LINE 508: Whose just division crown'd the soldier's toils;
LINE 509: But bright Chryseïs, heavenly prize! was led,
LINE 510: By vote selected, to the general's bed.
LINE 511: The priest of Phœbus sought by gifts to gain
LINE 512: His beauteous daughter from the victor's chain;
LINE 513: The fleet he reach'd, and, lowly bending down,
LINE 514: Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,
LINE 515: Intreating all; but chief implored for grace
LINE 516: The brother-kings of Atreus' royal race:
LINE 517: The generous Greeks their joint consent declare,
LINE 518: The priest to reverence, and release the fair;
LINE 519: Not so Atrides: he, with wonted pride,
LINE 520: The sire insulted, and his gifts denied:
LINE 521: The insulted sire (his god's peculiar care)
LINE 522: To Phœbus pray'd, and Phœbus heard the prayer:
LINE 523: A dreadful plague ensues: the avenging darts
LINE 524: Incessant fly, and pierce the Grecian hearts.
LINE 525: A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,
LINE 526: And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:
LINE 527: Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
LINE 528: To avert the vengeance of the power divine;
LINE 529: Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm'd;
LINE 530: Incensed he threaten'd, and his threats perform'd:
LINE 531: The fair Chryseïs to her sire was sent,
LINE 532: With offer'd gifts to make the god relent;
LINE 533: But now he seized Briseïs' heavenly charms,
LINE 534: And of my valour's prize defrauds my arms,
LINE 535: Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;[63]
LINE 536: And service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.
LINE 537: But, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.
LINE 538: To high Olympus' shining court ascend,
LINE 539: Urge all the ties to former service owed,
LINE 540: And sue for vengeance to the thundering god.
LINE 541: Oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious boast,
LINE 542: That thou stood'st forth of all the ethereal host,
LINE 543: When bold rebellion shook the realms above,
LINE 544: The undaunted guard of cloud-compelling Jove:
LINE 545: When the bright partner of his awful reign,
LINE 546: The warlike maid, and monarch of the main,
LINE 547: The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,
LINE 548: Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.
LINE 549: Then, call'd by thee, the monster Titan came
LINE 550: (Whom gods Briareus, men Ægeon name),
LINE 551: Through wondering skies enormous stalk'd along;
LINE 552: Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:
LINE 553: With giant-pride at Jove's high throne he stands,
LINE 554: And brandish'd round him all his hundred hands:
LINE 555: The affrighted gods confess'd their awful lord,
LINE 556: They dropp'd the fetters, trembled, and adored.[64]
LINE 557: This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,
LINE 558: Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;
LINE 559: Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,
LINE 560: To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,
LINE 561: To heap the shores with copious death, and bring
LINE 562: The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.
LINE 563: Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head
LINE 564: O'er all his wide dominion of the dead,
LINE 565: And mourn in blood that e'er he durst disgrace
LINE 566: The boldest warrior of the Grecian race."
LINE 567: [Illustration: ] THETIS CALLING BRIAREUS TO THE ASSISTANCE OF JUPITER
LINE 568: "Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus replies,
LINE 569: While tears celestial trickle from her eyes)
LINE 570: Why have I borne thee with a mother's throes,
LINE 571: To Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?[65]
LINE 572: So short a space the light of heaven to view!
LINE 573: So short a space! and fill'd with sorrow too!
LINE 574: O might a parent's careful wish prevail,
LINE 575: Far, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,
LINE 576: And thou, from camps remote, the danger shun
LINE 577: Which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.
LINE 578: Yet (what I can) to move thy suit I'll go
LINE 579: To great Olympus crown'd with fleecy snow.
LINE 580: Meantime, secure within thy ships, from far
LINE 581: Behold the field, not mingle in the war.
LINE 582: The sire of gods and all the ethereal train,
LINE 583: On the warm limits of the farthest main,
LINE 584: Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace
LINE 585: The feasts of Æthiopia's blameless race,[66]
LINE 586: Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,
LINE 587: Returning with the twelfth revolving light.
LINE 588: Then will I mount the brazen dome, and move
LINE 589: The high tribunal of immortal Jove."
LINE 590: The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;
LINE 591: Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,
LINE 592: And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,
LINE 593: In wild resentment for the fair he lost.
LINE 594: In Chrysa's port now sage Ulysses rode;
LINE 595: Beneath the deck the destined victims stow'd:
LINE 596: The sails they furl'd, they lash the mast aside,
LINE 597: And dropp'd their anchors, and the pinnace tied.
LINE 598: Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;
LINE 599: Chryseïs last descending on the strand.
LINE 600: Her, thus returning from the furrow'd main,
LINE 601: Ulysses led to Phœbus' sacred fane;
LINE 602: Where at his solemn altar, as the maid
LINE 603: He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:
LINE 604: "Hail, reverend priest! to Phœbus' awful dome
LINE 605: A suppliant I from great Atrides come:
LINE 606: Unransom'd, here receive the spotless fair;
LINE 607: Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;
LINE 608: And may thy god who scatters darts around,
LINE 609: Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound."[67]
LINE 610: At this, the sire embraced the maid again,
LINE 611: So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.
LINE 612: Then near the altar of the darting king,
LINE 613: Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;
LINE 614: With water purify their hands, and take
LINE 615: The sacred offering of the salted cake;
LINE 616: While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,
LINE 617: And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:
LINE 618: "God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,
LINE 619: Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;
LINE 620: Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,
LINE 621: And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish'd rays!
LINE 622: If, fired to vengeance at thy priest's request,
LINE 623: Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:
LINE 624: Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,
LINE 625: And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow."
LINE 626: So Chryses pray'd. Apollo heard his prayer:
LINE 627: And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;
LINE 628: Between their horns the salted barley threw,
LINE 629: And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:[68]
LINE 630: The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;
LINE 631: The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:
LINE 632: On these, in double cauls involved with art,
LINE 633: The choicest morsels lay from every part.
LINE 634: The priest himself before his altar stands,
LINE 635: And burns the offering with his holy hands.
LINE 636: Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;
LINE 637: The youth with instruments surround the fire:
LINE 638: The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,
LINE 639: The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:
LINE 640: Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;
LINE 641: Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
LINE 642: When now the rage of hunger was repress'd,
LINE 643: With pure libations they conclude the feast;
LINE 644: The youths with wine the copious goblets crown'd,[69]
LINE 645: And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around
LINE 646: With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,
LINE 647: The pæans lengthen'd till the sun descends:
LINE 648: The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;
LINE 649: Apollo listens, and approves the song.
LINE 650: 'Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,
LINE 651: Till rosy morn had purpled o'er the sky:
LINE 652: Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,
LINE 653: Supplied by Phœbus, fill the swelling sails;
LINE 654: The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,
LINE 655: The parted ocean foams and roars below:
LINE 656: Above the bounding billows swift they flew,
LINE 657: Till now the Grecian camp appear'd in view.
LINE 658: Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,
LINE 659: (The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)
LINE 660: Then part, where stretch'd along the winding bay,
LINE 661: The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.
LINE 662: But raging still, amidst his navy sat
LINE 663: The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;
LINE 664: Nor mix'd in combat, nor in council join'd;
LINE 665: But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:
LINE 666: In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,
LINE 667: And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.
LINE 668: Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light
LINE 669: The gods had summon'd to the Olympian height:
LINE 670: Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,
LINE 671: Leads the long order of ethereal powers.
LINE 672: When, like the morning-mist in early day,
LINE 673: Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:
LINE 674: And to the seats divine her flight address'd.
LINE 675: There, far apart, and high above the rest,
LINE 676: The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds
LINE 677: His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.
LINE 678: Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed
LINE 679: Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.
LINE 680: "If e'er, O father of the gods! (she said)
LINE 681: My words could please thee, or my actions aid,
LINE 682: Some marks of honour on my son bestow,
LINE 683: And pay in glory what in life you owe.
LINE 684: Fame is at least by heavenly promise due
LINE 685: To life so short, and now dishonour'd too.
LINE 686: Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!
LINE 687: Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;
LINE 688: Till the proud king and all the Achaian race
LINE 689: Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace."
LINE 690: [Illustration: ] THETIS ENTREATING JUPITER TO HONOUR ACHILLES
LINE 691: Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held
LINE 692: The sacred counsels of his breast conceal'd.
LINE 693: Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press'd,
LINE 694: Still grasp'd his knees, and urged the dear request.
LINE 695: "O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;
LINE 696: Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?
LINE 697: Or oh! declare, of all the powers above,
LINE 698: Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?"
LINE 699: She said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,
LINE 700: Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies:
LINE 701: "What hast thou ask'd? ah, why should Jove engage
LINE 702: In foreign contests and domestic rage,
LINE 703: The gods' complaints, and Juno's fierce alarms,
LINE 704: While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?
LINE 705: Go, lest the haughty partner of my sway
LINE 706: With jealous eyes thy close access survey;
LINE 707: But part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:
LINE 708: Witness the sacred honours of our head,
LINE 709: The nod that ratifies the will divine,
LINE 710: The faithful, fix'd, irrevocable sign;
LINE 711: This seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows—"
LINE 712: He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,[70]
LINE 713: Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,
LINE 714: The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:
LINE 715: High heaven with trembling the dread signal took,
LINE 716: And all Olympus to the centre shook.[71]
LINE 717: Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,
LINE 718: Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.
LINE 719: The shining synod of the immortals wait
LINE 720: The coming god, and from their thrones of state
LINE 721: Arising silent, wrapp'd in holy fear,
LINE 722: Before the majesty of heaven appear.
LINE 723: Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,
LINE 724: All, but the god's imperious queen alone:
LINE 725: Late had she view'd the silver-footed dame,
LINE 726: And all her passions kindled into flame.
LINE 727: "Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),
LINE 728: Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?
LINE 729: Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,
LINE 730: In vain the partner of imperial state.
LINE 731: What favourite goddess then those cares divides,
LINE 732: Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides?"
LINE 733: To this the thunderer: "Seek not thou to find
LINE 734: The sacred counsels of almighty mind:
LINE 735: Involved in darkness lies the great decree,
LINE 736: Nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.
LINE 737: What fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know;
LINE 738: The first of gods above, and men below;
LINE 739: But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll
LINE 740: Deep in the close recesses of my soul."
LINE 741: Full on the sire the goddess of the skies
LINE 742: Roll'd the large orbs of her majestic eyes,
LINE 743: And thus return'd:—"Austere Saturnius, say,
LINE 744: From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?
LINE 745: Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,
LINE 746: And all thy counsels take the destined course.
LINE 747: But 'tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,
LINE 748: In close consult, the silver-footed queen.
LINE 749: Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,
LINE 750: Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.
LINE 751: What fatal favour has the goddess won,
LINE 752: To grace her fierce, inexorable son?
LINE 753: Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,
LINE 754: And glut his vengeance with my people slain."
LINE 755: Then thus the god: "O restless fate of pride,
LINE 756: That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;
LINE 757: Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr'd,
LINE 758: Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.
LINE 759: Let this suffice: the immutable decree
LINE 760: No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.
LINE 761: Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,
LINE 762: But dread the power of this avenging hand:
LINE 763: The united strength of all the gods above
LINE 764: In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove."
LINE 765: [Illustration: ] VULCAN
LINE 766: The thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply;
LINE 767: A reverent horror silenced all the sky.
LINE 768: The feast disturb'd, with sorrow Vulcan saw
LINE 769: His mother menaced, and the gods in awe;
LINE 770: Peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,
LINE 771: Thus interposed the architect divine:
LINE 772: "The wretched quarrels of the mortal state
LINE 773: Are far unworthy, gods! of your debate:
LINE 774: Let men their days in senseless strife employ,
LINE 775: We, in eternal peace and constant joy.
LINE 776: Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,
LINE 777: Nor break the sacred union of the sky:
LINE 778: Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless'd abodes,
LINE 779: Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.
LINE 780: If you submit, the thunderer stands appeased;
LINE 781: The gracious power is willing to be pleased."
LINE 782: Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a bound,
LINE 783: The double bowl with sparkling nectar crown'd,[72]
LINE 784: Which held to Juno in a cheerful way,
LINE 785: "Goddess (he cried), be patient and obey.
LINE 786: Dear as you are, if Jove his arm extend,
LINE 787: I can but grieve, unable to defend.
LINE 788: What god so daring in your aid to move,
LINE 789: Or lift his hand against the force of Jove?
LINE 790: Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,
LINE 791: Hurl'd headlong down from the ethereal height;[73]
LINE 792: Toss'd all the day in rapid circles round,
LINE 793: Nor till the sun descended touch'd the ground.
LINE 794: Breathless I fell, in giddy motion lost;
LINE 795: The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;[74]
LINE 796: He said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,
LINE 797: Which, with a smile, the white-arm'd queen received
LINE 798: Then, to the rest he fill'd; and in his turn,
LINE 799: Each to his lips applied the nectar'd urn,
LINE 800: Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,
LINE 801: And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the skies.
LINE 802: Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,
LINE 803: In feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.[75]
LINE 804: Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses round
LINE 805: With voice alternate aid the silver sound.
LINE 806: Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
LINE 807: Descending swift, roll'd down the rapid light:
LINE 808: Then to their starry domes the gods depart,
LINE 809: The shining monuments of Vulcan's art:
LINE 810: Jove on his couch reclined his awful head,
LINE 811: And Juno slumber'd on the golden bed.
