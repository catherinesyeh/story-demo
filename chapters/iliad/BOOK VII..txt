LINE 1: ARGUMENT
LINE 2: THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.
LINE 3: The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector,
LINE 4: Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her
LINE 5: descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scæan gate. They agree to put
LINE 6: off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge
LINE 7: the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the
LINE 8: challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after
LINE 9: several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a
LINE 10: council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which
LINE 11: Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam
LINE 12: sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning
LINE 13: the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the
LINE 14: funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,
LINE 15: erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with
LINE 16: towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his
LINE 17: jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both
LINE 18: armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans
LINE 19: with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.
LINE 20: The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,
LINE 21: the next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the
LINE 22: funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the
LINE 23: fortification before the ships. So that somewhat about three days
LINE 24: is employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field.
LINE 25: So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,
LINE 26: Then rush'd impetuous through the Scæan gate.
LINE 27: Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;
LINE 28: Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.
LINE 29: As when to sailors labouring through the main,
LINE 30: That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,
LINE 31: Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;
LINE 32: The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.
LINE 33: So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,
LINE 34: The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.
LINE 35: Bold Paris first the work of death begun
LINE 36: On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,
LINE 37: Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,
LINE 38: The pleasing Arnè was his native place.
LINE 39: Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,
LINE 40: Beneath his steely casque[177] he felt the blow
LINE 41: Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;
LINE 42: And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.
LINE 43: By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,
LINE 44: Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
LINE 45: Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,
LINE 46: Drop the cold useless members on the ground.
LINE 47: When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,
LINE 48: From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain
LINE 49: Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,
LINE 50: Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.
LINE 51: Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;
LINE 52: When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:
LINE 53: "What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!
LINE 54: Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?
LINE 55: Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,
LINE 56: To give to Greece the long divided day?
LINE 57: Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,
LINE 58: Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;
LINE 59: This day, the business of the field suspend;
LINE 60: War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;
LINE 61: Since vengeful goddesses confederate join
LINE 62: To raze her walls, though built by hands divine."
LINE 63: To whom the progeny of Jove replies:
LINE 64: "I left, for this, the council of the skies:
LINE 65: But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,
LINE 66: What art shall calm the furious sons of war?"
LINE 67: To her the god: "Great Hector's soul incite
LINE 68: To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,
LINE 69: Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show
LINE 70: A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe."
LINE 71: At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;
LINE 72: Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;
LINE 73: Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,
LINE 74: Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:
LINE 75: "O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear
LINE 76: Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!
LINE 77: Go forth persuasive, and a while engage
LINE 78: The warring nations to suspend their rage;
LINE 79: Then dare the boldest of the hostile train
LINE 80: To mortal combat on the listed plain.
LINE 81: For not this day shall end thy glorious date;
LINE 82: The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate."
LINE 83: He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;
LINE 84: Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,
LINE 85: Held by the midst athwart. On either hand
LINE 86: The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;
LINE 87: Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:
LINE 88: They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.
LINE 89: The Athenian maid,[178] and glorious god of day,
LINE 90: With silent joy the settling hosts survey:
LINE 91: In form of vultures, on the beech's height
LINE 92: They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.
LINE 93: The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,
LINE 94: Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.
LINE 95: As when a general darkness veils the main,
LINE 96: (Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)
LINE 97: The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,
LINE 98: And a still horror saddens all the deeps;
LINE 99: Thus in thick orders settling wide around,
LINE 100: At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.
LINE 101: Great Hector first amidst both armies broke
LINE 102: The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:
LINE 103: "Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,
LINE 104: What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.
LINE 105: Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,
LINE 106: O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;
LINE 107: War with a fiercer tide once more returns,
LINE 108: Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.
LINE 109: You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;
LINE 110: 'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:
LINE 111: From all your troops select the boldest knight,
LINE 112: And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.
LINE 113: Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,
LINE 114: Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;
LINE 115: But let my body, to my friends return'd,
LINE 116: By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.
LINE 117: And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,
LINE 118: Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;
LINE 119: If mine the glory to despoil the foe;
LINE 120: On Phœbus' temple I'll his arms bestow:
LINE 121: The breathless carcase to your navy sent,
LINE 122: Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;
LINE 123: Which when some future mariner surveys,
LINE 124: Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,
LINE 125: Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,
LINE 126: By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'
LINE 127: The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name
LINE 128: And distant ages learn the victor's fame."
LINE 129: This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,
LINE 130: Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.
LINE 131: Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,
LINE 132: And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:
LINE 133: "Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,
LINE 134: Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,
LINE 135: How great the shame, when every age shall know
LINE 136: That not a Grecian met this noble foe!
LINE 137: Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,
LINE 138: A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!
LINE 139: Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,
LINE 140: Myself will dare the danger of the day;
LINE 141: 'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,
LINE 142: But in the hands of God is victory."
LINE 143: These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
LINE 144: His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.
LINE 145: That day, Atrides! a superior hand
LINE 146: Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;
LINE 147: But all at once, thy fury to compose,
LINE 148: The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;
LINE 149: Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd
LINE 150: Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:
LINE 151: "Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,
LINE 152: And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?
LINE 153: Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;
LINE 154: Great Hector's arm is mightier far than thine:
LINE 155: Even fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,
LINE 156: And trembling met this dreadful son of war.
LINE 157: Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;
LINE 158: Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.
LINE 159: The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,
LINE 160: Though bold and burning with desire of fame,
LINE 161: Content the doubtful honour might forego,
LINE 162: So great the danger, and so brave the foe."
LINE 163: He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;
LINE 164: He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,
LINE 165: No longer bent to rush on certain harms;
LINE 166: His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.
LINE 167: He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,
LINE 168: Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;
LINE 169: Thus to the kings he spoke: "What grief, what shame
LINE 170: Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!
LINE 171: How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn
LINE 172: Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!
LINE 173: What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,
LINE 174: O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!
LINE 175: Once with what joy the generous prince would hear
LINE 176: Of every chief who fought this glorious war,
LINE 177: Participate their fame, and pleased inquire
LINE 178: Each name, each action, and each hero's sire!
LINE 179: Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,
LINE 180: And trembling all before one hostile hand;
LINE 181: How would he lift his aged arms on high,
LINE 182: Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!
LINE 183: Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,
LINE 184: Minerva, Phœbus, and almighty Jove!
LINE 185: Years might again roll back, my youth renew,
LINE 186: And give this arm the spring which once it knew
LINE 187: When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,
LINE 188: I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,
LINE 189: And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,
LINE 190: Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.[179]
LINE 191: There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,
LINE 192: Proud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;
LINE 193: Great Areithous, known from shore to shore
LINE 194: By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;
LINE 195: No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,
LINE 196: But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.
LINE 197: Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,
LINE 198: Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,
LINE 199: Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,
LINE 200: Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.
LINE 201: Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before
LINE 202: Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:
LINE 203: But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,
LINE 204: To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.
LINE 205: Furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,
LINE 206: And dared the trial of the strongest hands;
LINE 207: Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:
LINE 208: All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway
LINE 209: Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,
LINE 210: And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.
LINE 211: I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:
LINE 212: Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.
LINE 213: What then I was, O were your Nestor now!
LINE 214: Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.
LINE 215: But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,
LINE 216: The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,
LINE 217: Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,
LINE 218: Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?"
LINE 219: His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;
LINE 220: And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,
LINE 221: Up-started fierce: but far before the rest
LINE 222: The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:
LINE 223: Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;
LINE 224: And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;
LINE 225: Oïleus follow'd; Idomen was there,[180]
LINE 226: And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:
LINE 227: With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,
LINE 228: And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.
LINE 229: All these, alike inspired with noble rage,
LINE 230: Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:
LINE 231: "Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,
LINE 232: What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.
LINE 233: Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise
LINE 234: His country's fame, his own immortal praise."
LINE 235: The lots produced, each hero signs his own:
LINE 236: Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown,[181]
LINE 237: The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,
LINE 238: And vows like these ascend from all the bands:
LINE 239: "Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,
LINE 240: A worthy champion for the Grecian state:
LINE 241: This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,
LINE 242: Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove."
LINE 243: Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,
LINE 244: Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.
LINE 245: This from the right to left the herald bears,
LINE 246: Held out in order to the Grecian peers;
LINE 247: Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,
LINE 248: Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;
LINE 249: Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,
LINE 250: Then casts before him, and with transport cries:
LINE 251: "Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;
LINE 252: Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.
LINE 253: Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,
LINE 254: To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:
LINE 255: But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,
LINE 256: And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.
LINE 257: Said I in secret? No, your vows declare
LINE 258: In such a voice as fills the earth and air,
LINE 259: Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?
LINE 260: Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!
LINE 261: From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,
LINE 262: And, born to combats, fear no force on earth."
LINE 263: He said. The troops with elevated eyes,
LINE 264: Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:
LINE 265: "O father of mankind, superior lord!
LINE 266: On lofty Ida's holy hill adored:
LINE 267: Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,
LINE 268: Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:
LINE 269: Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away
LINE 270: The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;
LINE 271: Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,
LINE 272: That both may claim it, and that both may share."
LINE 273: Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;
LINE 274: Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:
LINE 275: He moves to combat with majestic pace;
LINE 276: So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,[182]
LINE 277: When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,
LINE 278: And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,
LINE 279: Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;
LINE 280: Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]
LINE 281: His massy javelin quivering in his hand,
LINE 282: He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.
LINE 283: Through every Argive heart new transport ran;
LINE 284: All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:
LINE 285: Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,
LINE 286: Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:
LINE 287: 'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;
LINE 288: Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.
LINE 289: Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,
LINE 290: As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.
LINE 291: Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,
LINE 292: Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,
LINE 293: (The work of Tychius, who in Hylè dwell'd
LINE 294: And in all arts of armoury excell'd,)
LINE 295: This Ajax bore before his manly breast,
LINE 296: And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:
LINE 297: "Hector! approach my arm, and singly know
LINE 298: What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.
LINE 299: Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,
LINE 300: Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:
LINE 301: Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,
LINE 302: Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;
LINE 303: Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,
LINE 304: And sends thee one, a sample of her host,
LINE 305: Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;
LINE 306: No more—be sudden, and begin the fight."
LINE 307: "O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!
LINE 308: (To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)
LINE 309: Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,
LINE 310: New to the field, and trembling at the fight?
LINE 311: Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,
LINE 312: To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:
LINE 313: I know to shift my ground, remount the car,
LINE 314: Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;
LINE 315: To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,
LINE 316: And bear thick battle on my sounding shield/
LINE 317: But open be our fight, and bold each blow;
LINE 318: I steal no conquest from a noble foe."
LINE 319: He said, and rising, high above the field
LINE 320: Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.
LINE 321: Full on the brass descending from above
LINE 322: Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,
LINE 323: Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;
LINE 324: Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,
LINE 325: His corslet enters, and his garment rends,
LINE 326: And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.
LINE 327: The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low
LINE 328: Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.
LINE 329: From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,
LINE 330: Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;
LINE 331: Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,
LINE 332: Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.
LINE 333: At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;
LINE 334: The blunted point against the buckler bends;
LINE 335: But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,
LINE 336: Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;
LINE 337: It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!
LINE 338: Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.
LINE 339: Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,
LINE 340: In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,
LINE 341: Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;
LINE 342: Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;
LINE 343: The hollow brass resounded with the shock:
LINE 344: Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,
LINE 345: Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,
LINE 346: With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;
LINE 347: The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:
LINE 348: His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;
LINE 349: Great Hector falls extended on the field,
LINE 350: His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:
LINE 351: Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might
LINE 352: Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.
LINE 353: And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
LINE 354: In flaming circles round their heads they flew;
LINE 355: But then by heralds' voice the word was given.
LINE 356: The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:
LINE 357: Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,
LINE 358: And sage Idæus on the part of Troy,
LINE 359: Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;
LINE 360: And first Idæus' awful voice was heard:
LINE 361: [Illustration: ] HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS
LINE 362: "Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,
LINE 363: Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.
LINE 364: To either host your matchless worth is known,
LINE 365: Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.
LINE 366: But now the Night extends her awful shade;
LINE 367: The goddess parts you; be the night obey'd."[184]
LINE 368: To whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:
LINE 369: "O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.
LINE 370: Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,
LINE 371: Let him demand the sanction of the night;
LINE 372: If first he ask'd it, I content obey,
LINE 373: And cease the strife when Hector shows the way."
LINE 374: "O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)
LINE 375: Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,
LINE 376: With strength of body, and with worth of mind!
LINE 377: Now martial law commands us to forbear;
LINE 378: Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,
LINE 379: Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,
LINE 380: And let the gods decide of death or life!
LINE 381: Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,
LINE 382: And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.
LINE 383: Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,
LINE 384: And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;
LINE 385: As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,
LINE 386: Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.
LINE 387: But let us, on this memorable day,
LINE 388: Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,
LINE 389: 'Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;
LINE 390: And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'"
LINE 391: With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,
LINE 392: The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,
LINE 393: He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd
LINE 394: A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.
LINE 395: Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;
LINE 396: This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.
LINE 397: The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,
LINE 398: And hail with joy the Champion of their state;
LINE 399: Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,
LINE 400: Alive, unarm'd, and vigorous from his wound;
LINE 401: To Troy's high gates the godlike man they bear
LINE 402: Their present triumph, as their late despair.
LINE 403: But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,
LINE 404: The well-arm'd Greeks to Agamemnon lead.
LINE 405: A steer for sacrifice the king design'd,
LINE 406: Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.
LINE 407: The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,
LINE 408: The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;
LINE 409: Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
LINE 410: Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
LINE 411: The king himself (an honorary sign)
LINE 412: Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.[185]
LINE 413: When now the rage of hunger was removed,
LINE 414: Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,
LINE 415: The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,
LINE 416: In words like these his prudent thought express'd:
LINE 417: "How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,
LINE 418: What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!
LINE 419: What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!
LINE 420: What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!
LINE 421: Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light
LINE 422: Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:
LINE 423: Some space at least permit the war to breathe,
LINE 424: While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,
LINE 425: From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,
LINE 426: And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;
LINE 427: So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,
LINE 428: And pious children o'er their ashes weep.
LINE 429: Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,
LINE 430: High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;
LINE 431: Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,
LINE 432: Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;
LINE 433: From space to space be ample gates around,
LINE 434: For passing chariots; and a trench profound.
LINE 435: So Greece to combat shall in safety go,
LINE 436: Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe."
LINE 437: 'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;
LINE 438: The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.
LINE 439: Meanwhile, convened at Priam's palace-gate,
LINE 440: The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;
LINE 441: A senate void of order, as of choice:
LINE 442: Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.
LINE 443: Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:
LINE 444: "Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!
LINE 445: 'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,
LINE 446: And I but move what every god requires:
LINE 447: Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored,
LINE 448: And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.
LINE 449: The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,
LINE 450: Our impious battles the just gods provoke.
LINE 451: As this advice ye practise, or reject,
LINE 452: So hope success, or dread the dire effect."
LINE 453: The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied
LINE 454: The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:
LINE 455: "Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years
LINE 456: But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:
LINE 457: Old man, if void of fallacy or art,
LINE 458: Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,
LINE 459: Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;
LINE 460: But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.
LINE 461: Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!
LINE 462: Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;
LINE 463: My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;
LINE 464: But be this bright possession ever mine."
LINE 465: 'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,
LINE 466: Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:
LINE 467: His godlike aspect deep attention drew:
LINE 468: He paused, and these pacific words ensue:
LINE 469: "Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!
LINE 470: Now take refreshment as the hour demands;
LINE 471: Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.
LINE 472: Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.
LINE 473: Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,
LINE 474: Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.
LINE 475: Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn
LINE 476: Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;
LINE 477: That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
LINE 478: And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"
LINE 479: The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste
LINE 480: (Each at his post in arms) a short repast.
LINE 481: Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,
LINE 482: To the black ships Idæus bent his way;
LINE 483: There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,
LINE 484: He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.
LINE 485: "Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!
LINE 486: The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.
LINE 487: Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)
LINE 488: What Paris, author of the war, declares.
LINE 489: The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore
LINE 490: (Oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)
LINE 491: He proffers injured Greece: with large increase
LINE 492: Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.
LINE 493: But to restore the beauteous bride again,
LINE 494: This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.
LINE 495: Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn
LINE 496: Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.
LINE 497: That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
LINE 498: And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"
LINE 499: The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;
LINE 500: At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:
LINE 501: "Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,
LINE 502: Their proffer'd wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.
LINE 503: Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,
LINE 504: And Troy already totters to her fall."
LINE 505: The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,
LINE 506: With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.
LINE 507: Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:
LINE 508: "Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece
LINE 509: For what remains; let funeral flames be fed
LINE 510: With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:
LINE 511: Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,
LINE 512: And gratify the manes of the slain.
LINE 513: Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!"
LINE 514: He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.
LINE 515: To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay
LINE 516: To wait the event, the herald bent his way.
LINE 517: He came, and standing in the midst, explain'd
LINE 518: The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.
LINE 519: Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,
LINE 520: Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:
LINE 521: Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,
LINE 522: Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.
LINE 523: And now from forth the chambers of the main,
LINE 524: To shed his sacred light on earth again,
LINE 525: Arose the golden chariot of the day,
LINE 526: And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.
LINE 527: In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train
LINE 528: Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.
LINE 529: Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,
LINE 530: With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.
LINE 531: The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,
LINE 532: And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.
LINE 533: Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste
LINE 534: The bodies decent on the piles were placed:
LINE 535: With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,
LINE 536: And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.
LINE 537: Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,
LINE 538: And decent on the pile dispose the dead;
LINE 539: The cold remains consume with equal care;
LINE 540: And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.
LINE 541: Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light
LINE 542: The doubtful confines of the day and night,
LINE 543: About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,
LINE 544: And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.
LINE 545: Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,
LINE 546: They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:[186]
LINE 547: From space to space were ample gates around,
LINE 548: For passing chariots, and a trench profound
LINE 549: Of large extent; and deep in earth below,
LINE 550: Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.
LINE 551: So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,
LINE 552: In shining circle round their father Jove,
LINE 553: Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:
LINE 554: Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:
LINE 555: "What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,
LINE 556: Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,
LINE 557: If the proud Grecians thus successful boast
LINE 558: Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?
LINE 559: See the long walls extending to the main,
LINE 560: No god consulted, and no victim slain!
LINE 561: Their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends,
LINE 562: Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;
LINE 563: While old Laomedon's divine abodes,
LINE 564: Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,
LINE 565: Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep."
LINE 566: Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.
LINE 567: The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,
LINE 568: That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:
LINE 569: "Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make
LINE 570: The solid earth's eternal basis shake!
LINE 571: What cause of fear from mortal works could move[187]
LINE 572: The meanest subject of our realms above?
LINE 573: Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,
LINE 574: Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.
LINE 575: But yon proud work no future age shall view,
LINE 576: No trace remain where once the glory grew.
LINE 577: The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,
LINE 578: And, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:
LINE 579: Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:
LINE 580: The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more."
LINE 581: Thus they in heaven: while, o'er the Grecian train,
LINE 582: The rolling sun descending to the main
LINE 583: Beheld the finish'd work. Their bulls they slew;
LINE 584: Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.
LINE 585: And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos' strands,
LINE 586: With Bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.
LINE 587: Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent
LINE 588: A thousant measures to the royal tent.
LINE 589: (Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore
LINE 590: To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)
LINE 591: The rest they purchased at their proper cost,
LINE 592: And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:
LINE 593: Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;[188]
LINE 594: Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.
LINE 595: All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:
LINE 596: Those on the fields, and these within their towers.
LINE 597: But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,
LINE 598: And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:
LINE 599: Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,
LINE 600: While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.
LINE 601: Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was crown'd;
LINE 602: And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground:
LINE 603: Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,
LINE 604: Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.
