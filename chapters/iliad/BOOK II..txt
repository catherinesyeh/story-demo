LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.
LINE 3: Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful
LINE 4: vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in
LINE 5: order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The
LINE 6: general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his
LINE 7: assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the
LINE 8: late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial
LINE 9: of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design
LINE 10: to the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the
LINE 11: soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was
LINE 12: embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a
LINE 13: return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the
LINE 14: ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises
LINE 15: the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches
LINE 16: made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed,
LINE 17: which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them
LINE 18: into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives
LINE 19: occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and
LINE 20: Trojans, and in a large catalogue.
LINE 21: The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day.
LINE 22: The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards
LINE 23: the end it removes to Troy.
LINE 24: Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,
LINE 25: Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
LINE 26: The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;
LINE 27: All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.[76]
LINE 28: To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,
LINE 29: And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
LINE 30: Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
LINE 31: And thus commands the vision of the night.
LINE 32: "Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,[77]
LINE 33: To Agamemnon's ample tent repair.
LINE 34: Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,
LINE 35: Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.
LINE 36: Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy
LINE 37: The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
LINE 38: For now no more the gods with fate contend,
LINE 39: At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
LINE 40: Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
LINE 41: And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall."
LINE 42: Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,
LINE 43: Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head;
LINE 44: Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,
LINE 45: Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age:
LINE 46: Around his temples spreads his golden wing,
LINE 47: And thus the flattering dream deceives the king.
LINE 48: [Illustration: ] JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON
LINE 49: "Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,
LINE 50: O Atreus' son! canst thou indulge thy rest?[78]
LINE 51: Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
LINE 52: Directs in council, and in war presides,
LINE 53: To whom its safety a whole people owes,
LINE 54: To waste long nights in indolent repose.[79]
LINE 55: Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear;
LINE 56: Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.
LINE 57: In just array draw forth the embattled train,
LINE 58: Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;
LINE 59: E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy
LINE 60: The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
LINE 61: For now no more the gods with fate contend,
LINE 62: At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
LINE 63: Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
LINE 64: And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.
LINE 65: Awake, but waking this advice approve,
LINE 66: And trust the vision that descends from Jove."
LINE 67: The phantom said; then vanish'd from his sight,
LINE 68: Resolves to air, and mixes with the night.
LINE 69: A thousand schemes the monarch's mind employ;
LINE 70: Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:
LINE 71: Vain as he was, and to the future blind,
LINE 72: Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design'd,
LINE 73: What mighty toils to either host remain,
LINE 74: What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!
LINE 75: Eager he rises, and in fancy hears
LINE 76: The voice celestial murmuring in his ears.
LINE 77: First on his limbs a slender vest he drew,
LINE 78: Around him next the regal mantle threw,
LINE 79: The embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied;
LINE 80: The starry falchion glitter'd at his side;
LINE 81: And last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,
LINE 82: Unstain'd, immortal, and the gift of gods.
LINE 83: Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,
LINE 84: Lifts up her light, and opens day above.
LINE 85: The king despatch'd his heralds with commands
LINE 86: To range the camp and summon all the bands:
LINE 87: The gathering hosts the monarch's word obey;
LINE 88: While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.
LINE 89: In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;
LINE 90: There calls a senate of the peers around:
LINE 91: The assembly placed, the king of men express'd
LINE 92: The counsels labouring in his artful breast.
LINE 93: "Friends and confederates! with attentive ear
LINE 94: Receive my words, and credit what you hear.
LINE 95: Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night,
LINE 96: A dream divine appear'd before my sight;
LINE 97: Whose visionary form like Nestor came,
LINE 98: The same in habit, and in mien the same.[80]
LINE 99: The heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,
LINE 100: 'And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus' son? (he said)
LINE 101: Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
LINE 102: Directs in council, and in war presides;
LINE 103: To whom its safety a whole people owes,
LINE 104: To waste long nights in indolent repose.
LINE 105: Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,
LINE 106: Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.
LINE 107: In just array draw forth the embattled train,
LINE 108: And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;
LINE 109: E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy
LINE 110: The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
LINE 111: For now no more the gods with fate contend,
LINE 112: At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
LINE 113: Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
LINE 114: And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.
LINE 115: This hear observant, and the gods obey!'
LINE 116: The vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.
LINE 117: Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,
LINE 118: Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.
LINE 119: But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,
LINE 120: Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.
LINE 121: To move the troops to measure back the main,
LINE 122: Be mine; and yours the province to detain."
LINE 123: He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,
LINE 124: (Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)
LINE 125: "Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,
LINE 126: Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;
LINE 127: Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,
LINE 128: Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!
LINE 129: Then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,
LINE 130: And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms."
LINE 131: Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay
LINE 132: Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:
LINE 133: The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,
LINE 134: Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.
LINE 135: As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees
LINE 136: Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,
LINE 137: Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,
LINE 138: With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;
LINE 139: Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,
LINE 140: And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.[81]
LINE 141: So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train
LINE 142: Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:
LINE 143: Along the region runs a deafening sound;
LINE 144: Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.
LINE 145: Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,
LINE 146: And shining soars, and claps her wings above.
LINE 147: Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud[82]
LINE 148: The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.
LINE 149: Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,
LINE 150: And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,
LINE 151: The king of kings his awful figure raised:
LINE 152: High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;
LINE 153: The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,
LINE 154: By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.
LINE 155: To Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;
LINE 156: The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,
LINE 157: In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,
LINE 158: To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;
LINE 159: And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,
LINE 160: Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.[83]
LINE 161: On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,
LINE 162: And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:
LINE 163: "Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,
LINE 164: Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!
LINE 165: Of partial Jove with justice I complain,
LINE 166: And heavenly oracles believed in vain
LINE 167: A safe return was promised to our toils,
LINE 168: Renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.
LINE 169: Now shameful flight alone can save the host,
LINE 170: Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.
LINE 171: So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!
LINE 172: At whose command whole empires rise or fall:
LINE 173: He shakes the feeble props of human trust,
LINE 174: And towns and armies humbles to the dust.
LINE 175: What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,
LINE 176: Oh, lasting shame in every future age!
LINE 177: Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,
LINE 178: Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.
LINE 179: So small their number, that if wars were ceased,
LINE 180: And Greece triumphant held a general feast,
LINE 181: All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine
LINE 182: Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.[84]
LINE 183: But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,
LINE 184: And Troy prevails by armies not her own.
LINE 185: Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,
LINE 186: Since first the labours of this war begun:
LINE 187: Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,
LINE 188: And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.
LINE 189: Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!
LINE 190: Our weeping wives, our tender children call:
LINE 191: Love, duty, safety, summon us away,
LINE 192: 'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey.
LINE 193: Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,
LINE 194: Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.
LINE 195: Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,
LINE 196: And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy."
LINE 197: His deep design unknown, the hosts approve
LINE 198: Atrides' speech. The mighty numbers move.
LINE 199: So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,
LINE 200: From east and south when winds begin to roar,
LINE 201: Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep
LINE 202: The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.
LINE 203: And as on corn when western gusts descend,[85]
LINE 204: Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:
LINE 205: Thus o'er the field the moving host appears,
LINE 206: With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.
LINE 207: The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet
LINE 208: Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;
LINE 209: With long-resounding cries they urge the train
LINE 210: To fit the ships, and launch into the main.
LINE 211: They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,
LINE 212: The doubling clamours echo to the skies.
LINE 213: E'en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,
LINE 214: And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;
LINE 215: But Jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd,
LINE 216: And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:
LINE 217: "Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!
LINE 218: And leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?
LINE 219: Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,
LINE 220: In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?
LINE 221: And bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,
LINE 222: Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?
LINE 223: No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,
LINE 224: Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.
LINE 225: Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,
LINE 226: Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main."
LINE 227: Pallas obeys, and from Olympus' height
LINE 228: Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.
LINE 229: Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,
LINE 230: For prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:
LINE 231: Oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,
LINE 232: Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.
LINE 233: "And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,
LINE 234: Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),
LINE 235: Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,
LINE 236: And fame eternal leave to Priam's race?
LINE 237: Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,
LINE 238: Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!
LINE 239: Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,
LINE 240: Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.
LINE 241: Your own resistless eloquence employ,
LINE 242: And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy."
LINE 243: The voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,
LINE 244: Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:
LINE 245: Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand
LINE 246: Received the imperial sceptre of command.
LINE 247: Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,
LINE 248: He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;
LINE 249: Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,
LINE 250: He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.
LINE 251: "Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,
LINE 252: By brave examples should confirm the rest.
LINE 253: The monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;
LINE 254: He tries our courage, but resents our fears.
LINE 255: The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;
LINE 256: Not thus the king in secret council spoke.
LINE 257: Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,
LINE 258: Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings."
LINE 259: But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,
LINE 260: Him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.
LINE 261: "Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;
LINE 262: Unknown alike in council and in field!
LINE 263: Ye gods, what dastards would our host command!
LINE 264: Swept to the war, the lumber of a land.
LINE 265: Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd
LINE 266: That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.
LINE 267: To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;
LINE 268: His are the laws, and him let all obey."[86]
LINE 269: With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,
LINE 270: The loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.
LINE 271: Back to the assembly roll the thronging train,
LINE 272: Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.
LINE 273: Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,
LINE 274: And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;
LINE 275: The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,
LINE 276: The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.
LINE 277: At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,
LINE 278: And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.
LINE 279: Thersites only clamour'd in the throng,
LINE 280: Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:
LINE 281: Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,
LINE 282: In scandal busy, in reproaches bold:
LINE 283: With witty malice studious to defame,
LINE 284: Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:—
LINE 285: But chief he gloried with licentious style
LINE 286: To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.
LINE 287: His figure such as might his soul proclaim;
LINE 288: One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:
LINE 289: His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,
LINE 290: Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.
LINE 291: Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,
LINE 292: And much he hated all, but most the best:
LINE 293: Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;
LINE 294: But royal scandal his delight supreme,
LINE 295: Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,
LINE 296: Vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.
LINE 297: Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,
LINE 298: Thus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.
LINE 299: "Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,
LINE 300: What moves the great Atrides to complain?
LINE 301: 'Tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,
LINE 302: The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.
LINE 303: With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,
LINE 304: Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.
LINE 305: Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,
LINE 306: What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?
LINE 307: Say, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers
LINE 308: (The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,
LINE 309: And bring the race of royal bastards here,
LINE 310: For Troy to ransom at a price too dear?
LINE 311: But safer plunder thy own host supplies;
LINE 312: Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?
LINE 313: Or, if thy heart to generous love be led,
LINE 314: Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?
LINE 315: Whate'er our master craves submit we must,
LINE 316: Plagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.
LINE 317: Oh women of Achaia; men no more!
LINE 318: Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store
LINE 319: In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.
LINE 320: We may be wanted on some busy day,
LINE 321: When Hector comes: so great Achilles may:
LINE 322: From him he forced the prize we jointly gave,
LINE 323: From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:
LINE 324: And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,
LINE 325: This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long."
LINE 326: Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,[87]
LINE 327: In generous vengeance of the king of kings.
LINE 328: With indignation sparkling in his eyes,
LINE 329: He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:
LINE 330: "Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,
LINE 331: With wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:
LINE 332: Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,
LINE 333: And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.
LINE 334: Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host,
LINE 335: The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?
LINE 336: Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,
LINE 337: Nor let those lips profane the name of king.
LINE 338: For our return we trust the heavenly powers;
LINE 339: Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.
LINE 340: But grant the host with wealth the general load,
LINE 341: Except detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?
LINE 342: Suppose some hero should his spoils resign,
LINE 343: Art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?
LINE 344: Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,
LINE 345: And let these eyes behold my son no more;
LINE 346: If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear
LINE 347: To strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,
LINE 348: Expel the council where our princes meet,
LINE 349: And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet."
LINE 350: He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,
LINE 351: The weighty sceptre on his back descends.[88]
LINE 352: On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:
LINE 353: The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;
LINE 354: Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,
LINE 355: From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;
LINE 356: While to his neighbour each express'd his thought:
LINE 357: "Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!
LINE 358: What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!
LINE 359: Great in the council, glorious in the field.
LINE 360: Generous he rises in the crown's defence,
LINE 361: To curb the factious tongue of insolence,
LINE 362: Such just examples on offenders shown,
LINE 363: Sedition silence, and assert the throne."
LINE 364: 'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,
LINE 365: Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:
LINE 366: The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,
LINE 367: (In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.
LINE 368: The expecting crowds in still attention hung,
LINE 369: To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.
LINE 370: Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,
LINE 371: His silence thus the prudent hero broke:
LINE 372: "Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race
LINE 373: With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.
LINE 374: Not such at Argos was their generous vow:
LINE 375: Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:
LINE 376: Ne'er to return, was then the common cry,
LINE 377: Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.
LINE 378: Behold them weeping for their native shore;
LINE 379: What could their wives or helpless children more?
LINE 380: What heart but melts to leave the tender train,
LINE 381: And, one short month, endure the wintry main?
LINE 382: Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,
LINE 383: When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:
LINE 384: Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,
LINE 385: The tedious length of nine revolving years.
LINE 386: Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;
LINE 387: But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!
LINE 388: Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.
LINE 389: And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.
LINE 390: What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,[89]
LINE 391: And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.
LINE 392: Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised
LINE 393: Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:
LINE 394: 'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,
LINE 395: The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground
LINE 396: A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;
LINE 397: From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.
LINE 398: Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,
LINE 399: And curl'd around in many a winding fold;
LINE 400: The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;
LINE 401: Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;
LINE 402: Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,
LINE 403: Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;
LINE 404: While hovering near, with miserable moan,
LINE 405: The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.
LINE 406: The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
LINE 407: Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;
LINE 408: Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands
LINE 409: A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.
LINE 410: Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare
LINE 411: Trust in his omen, and support the war.
LINE 412: For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,
LINE 413: And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,
LINE 414: Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,[90]
LINE 415: 'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.
LINE 416: This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,
LINE 417: Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.
LINE 418: As many birds as by the snake were slain,
LINE 419: So many years the toils of Greece remain;
LINE 420: But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'
LINE 421: Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.
LINE 422: Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,
LINE 423: Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate."
LINE 424: He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,
LINE 425: The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.
LINE 426: Then Nestor thus—"These vain debates forbear,
LINE 427: Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.
LINE 428: Where now are all your high resolves at last?
LINE 429: Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?
LINE 430: Vow'd with libations and with victims then,
LINE 431: Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!
LINE 432: While useless words consume the unactive hours,
LINE 433: No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.
LINE 434: Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;
LINE 435: We march to war, if thou direct the way.
LINE 436: But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,
LINE 437: The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,
LINE 438: To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,
LINE 439: And view with envy our successful wars.
LINE 440: On that great day, when first the martial train,
LINE 441: Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,
LINE 442: Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,
LINE 443: And thunder rolling shook the firmament.
LINE 444: Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,
LINE 445: Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,
LINE 446: Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,
LINE 447: And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.
LINE 448: Before that day, if any Greek invite
LINE 449: His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,
LINE 450: Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,
LINE 451: And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.
LINE 452: But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:[91]
LINE 453: Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.
LINE 454: Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;
LINE 455: In tribes and nations to divide thy train:
LINE 456: His separate troops let every leader call,
LINE 457: Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.
LINE 458: What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,
LINE 459: Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,
LINE 460: When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known
LINE 461: And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;
LINE 462: If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,
LINE 463: If gods above prevent, or men below."
LINE 464: To him the king: "How much thy years excel
LINE 465: In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!
LINE 466: O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree
LINE 467: But ten such sages as they grant in thee;
LINE 468: Such wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,
LINE 469: And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!
LINE 470: But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates
LINE 471: In fierce contention and in vain debates:
LINE 472: Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,
LINE 473: By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:
LINE 474: If e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall
LINE 475: Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!
LINE 476: But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;
LINE 477: And, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.
LINE 478: His sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,
LINE 479: And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,
LINE 480: Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,
LINE 481: And all for combat fit the rattling car.
LINE 482: This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;
LINE 483: No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;
LINE 484: Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:
LINE 485: Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;
LINE 486: Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,
LINE 487: With the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,
LINE 488: Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,
LINE 489: And each spent courser at the chariot blow.
LINE 490: Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,
LINE 491: Who dares to tremble on this signal day;
LINE 492: That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,
LINE 493: The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour."
LINE 494: The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,
LINE 495: Loud as the surges when the tempest blows,
LINE 496: That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,
LINE 497: And foam and thunder on the stony shore.
LINE 498: Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,
LINE 499: The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;
LINE 500: With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,
LINE 501: To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.
LINE 502: A steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,[92]
LINE 503: To Jove's high altars Agamemnon led:
LINE 504: There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;
LINE 505: And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.
LINE 506: Next came Idomeneus,[93] and Tydeus' son,[94]
LINE 507: Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;[95]
LINE 508: Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;
LINE 509: And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.[96]
LINE 510: The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take
LINE 511: The sacred offering of the salted cake:
LINE 512: When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;
LINE 513: "O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,
LINE 514: Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,
LINE 515: Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!
LINE 516: Hear! and before the burning sun descends,
LINE 517: Before the night her gloomy veil extends,
LINE 518: Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,
LINE 519: Be Priam's palace sunk in Grecian fires.
LINE 520: In Hector's breast be plunged this shining sword,
LINE 521: And slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!"
LINE 522: Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer
LINE 523: Great Jove refused, and toss'd in empty air:
LINE 524: The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,
LINE 525: Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.
LINE 526: Their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,
LINE 527: The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.
LINE 528: The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,
LINE 529: The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.
LINE 530: On these, in double cauls involved with art,
LINE 531: The choicest morsels lie from every part,
LINE 532: From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire
LINE 533: While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.
LINE 534: The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd
LINE 535: The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;
LINE 536: Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
LINE 537: Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
LINE 538: Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,
LINE 539: The generous Nestor thus the prince address'd.
LINE 540: "Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,
LINE 541: And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;
LINE 542: Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,
LINE 543: And lead to war when heaven directs the way."
LINE 544: He said; the monarch issued his commands;
LINE 545: Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;
LINE 546: The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,
LINE 547: In tribes and nations rank'd on either side.
LINE 548: High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;
LINE 549: From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;
LINE 550: The dreadful ægis, Jove's immortal shield,
LINE 551: Blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field:
LINE 552: Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,
LINE 553: Form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,
LINE 554: With this each Grecian's manly breast she warms,
LINE 555: Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,
LINE 556: No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,
LINE 557: But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.
LINE 558: As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,
LINE 559: The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;
LINE 560: The fires expanding, as the winds arise,
LINE 561: Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:
LINE 562: So from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,
LINE 563: A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.
LINE 564: Not less their number than the embodied cranes,
LINE 565: Or milk-white swans in Asius' watery plains.
LINE 566: That, o'er the windings of Cayster's springs,[97]
LINE 567: Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,
LINE 568: Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,
LINE 569: Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.
LINE 570: Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,
LINE 571: The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;[98]
LINE 572: With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,
LINE 573: And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.
LINE 574: Along the river's level meads they stand,
LINE 575: Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,
LINE 576: Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,
LINE 577: The wandering nation of a summer's day:
LINE 578: That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,
LINE 579: In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;
LINE 580: From pail to pail with busy murmur run
LINE 581: The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.
LINE 582: So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood
LINE 583: In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.
LINE 584: Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins
LINE 585: In close array, and forms the deepening lines.
LINE 586: Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain
LINE 587: Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.
LINE 588: The king of kings, majestically tall,
LINE 589: Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;
LINE 590: Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads
LINE 591: His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,
LINE 592: Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,
LINE 593: His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;[99]
LINE 594: Jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,
LINE 595: And dawning conquest played around his head.
LINE 596: Say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,
LINE 597: All-knowing goddesses! immortal nine![100]
LINE 598: Since earth's wide regions, heaven's umneasur'd height,
LINE 599: And hell's abyss, hide nothing from your sight,
LINE 600: (We, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below,
LINE 601: But guess by rumour, and but boast we know,)
LINE 602: O say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,
LINE 603: Or urged by wrongs, to Troy's destruction came.
LINE 604: To count them all, demands a thousand tongues,
LINE 605: A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs.
LINE 606: Daughters of Jove, assist! inspired by you
LINE 607: The mighty labour dauntless I pursue;
LINE 608: What crowded armies, from what climes they bring,
LINE 609: Their names, their numbers, and their chiefs I sing.
LINE 610: THE CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS.[101]
LINE 611: [Illustration: ] NEPTUNE
LINE 612: The hardy warriors whom Bœotia bred,
LINE 613: Penelius, Leitus, Prothoënor, led:
LINE 614: With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand,
LINE 615: Equal in arms, and equal in command.
LINE 616: These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields,
LINE 617: And Eteon's hills, and Hyrie's watery fields,
LINE 618: And Schoenos, Scholos, Græa near the main,
LINE 619: And Mycalessia's ample piny plain;
LINE 620: Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell,
LINE 621: Or Harma where Apollo's prophet fell;
LINE 622: Heleon and Hylè, which the springs o'erflow;
LINE 623: And Medeon lofty, and Ocalea low;
LINE 624: Or in the meads of Haliartus stray,
LINE 625: Or Thespia sacred to the god of day:
LINE 626: Onchestus, Neptune's celebrated groves;
LINE 627: Copæ, and Thisbè, famed for silver doves;
LINE 628: For flocks Erythræ, Glissa for the vine;
LINE 629: Platea green, and Nysa the divine;
LINE 630: And they whom Thebé's well-built walls inclose,
LINE 631: Where Mydè, Eutresis, Coronè, rose;
LINE 632: And Arnè rich, with purple harvests crown'd;
LINE 633: And Anthedon, Bœotia's utmost bound.
LINE 634: Full fifty ships they send, and each conveys
LINE 635: Twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.[102]
LINE 636: To these succeed Aspledon's martial train,
LINE 637: Who plough the spacious Orchomenian plain.
LINE 638: Two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throng,
LINE 639: Iälmen and Ascalaphus the strong:
LINE 640: Sons of Astyochè, the heavenly fair,
LINE 641: Whose virgin charms subdued the god of war:
LINE 642: (In Actor's court as she retired to rest,
LINE 643: The strength of Mars the blushing maid compress'd)
LINE 644: Their troops in thirty sable vessels sweep,
LINE 645: With equal oars, the hoarse-resounding deep.
LINE 646: The Phocians next in forty barks repair;
LINE 647: Epistrophus and Schedius head the war:
LINE 648: From those rich regions where Cephisus leads
LINE 649: His silver current through the flowery meads;
LINE 650: From Panopëa, Chrysa the divine,
LINE 651: Where Anemoria's stately turrets shine,
LINE 652: Where Pytho, Daulis, Cyparissus stood,
LINE 653: And fair Lilæ views the rising flood.
LINE 654: These, ranged in order on the floating tide,
LINE 655: Close, on the left, the bold Bœotians' side.
LINE 656: Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons on,
LINE 657: Ajax the less, Oïleus' valiant son;
LINE 658: Skill'd to direct the flying dart aright;
LINE 659: Swift in pursuit, and active in the fight.
LINE 660: Him, as their chief, the chosen troops attend,
LINE 661: Which Bessa, Thronus, and rich Cynos send;
LINE 662: Opus, Calliarus, and Scarphe's bands;
LINE 663: And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands,
LINE 664: And where Boägrius floats the lowly lands,
LINE 665: Or in fair Tarphe's sylvan seats reside:
LINE 666: In forty vessels cut the yielding tide.
LINE 667: Eubœa next her martial sons prepares,
LINE 668: And sends the brave Abantes to the wars:
LINE 669: Breathing revenge, in arms they take their way
LINE 670: From Chalcis' walls, and strong Eretria;
LINE 671: The Isteian fields for generous vines renown'd,
LINE 672: The fair Caristos, and the Styrian ground;
LINE 673: Where Dios from her towers o'erlooks the plain,
LINE 674: And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main.
LINE 675: Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair;
LINE 676: Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air;
LINE 677: But with protended spears in fighting fields
LINE 678: Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.
LINE 679: Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands,
LINE 680: Which bold Elphenor, fierce in arms, commands.
LINE 681: Full fifty more from Athens stem the main,
LINE 682: Led by Menestheus through the liquid plain.
LINE 683: (Athens the fair, where great Erectheus sway'd,
LINE 684: That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,
LINE 685: But from the teeming furrow took his birth,
LINE 686: The mighty offspring of the foodful earth.
LINE 687: Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane,
LINE 688: Adored with sacrifice and oxen slain;
LINE 689: Where, as the years revolve, her altars blaze,
LINE 690: And all the tribes resound the goddess' praise.)
LINE 691: No chief like thee, Menestheus! Greece could yield,
LINE 692: To marshal armies in the dusty field,
LINE 693: The extended wings of battle to display,
LINE 694: Or close the embodied host in firm array.
LINE 695: Nestor alone, improved by length of days,
LINE 696: For martial conduct bore an equal praise.
LINE 697: With these appear the Salaminian bands,
LINE 698: Whom the gigantic Telamon commands;
LINE 699: In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course,
LINE 700: And with the great Athenians join their force.
LINE 701: Next move to war the generous Argive train,
LINE 702: From high Trœzenè, and Maseta's plain,
LINE 703: And fair Ægina circled by the main:
LINE 704: Whom strong Tyrinthe's lofty walls surround,
LINE 705: And Epidaure with viny harvests crown'd:
LINE 706: And where fair Asinen and Hermoin show
LINE 707: Their cliffs above, and ample bay below.
LINE 708: These by the brave Euryalus were led,
LINE 709: Great Sthenelus, and greater Diomed;
LINE 710: But chief Tydides bore the sovereign sway:
LINE 711: In fourscore barks they plough the watery way.
LINE 712: The proud Mycenè arms her martial powers,
LINE 713: Cleonè, Corinth, with imperial towers,[103]
LINE 714: Fair Aræthyrea, Ornia's fruitful plain,
LINE 715: And Ægion, and Adrastus' ancient reign;
LINE 716: And those who dwell along the sandy shore,
LINE 717: And where Pellenè yields her fleecy store,
LINE 718: Where Helicè and Hyperesia lie,
LINE 719: And Gonoëssa's spires salute the sky.
LINE 720: Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band,
LINE 721: A hundred vessels in long order stand,
LINE 722: And crowded nations wait his dread command.
LINE 723: High on the deck the king of men appears,
LINE 724: And his refulgent arms in triumph wears;
LINE 725: Proud of his host, unrivall'd in his reign,
LINE 726: In silent pomp he moves along the main.
LINE 727: His brother follows, and to vengeance warms
LINE 728: The hardy Spartans, exercised in arms:
LINE 729: Phares and Brysia's valiant troops, and those
LINE 730: Whom Lacedæmon's lofty hills inclose;
LINE 731: Or Messé's towers for silver doves renown'd,
LINE 732: Amyclæ, Laäs, Augia's happy ground,
LINE 733: And those whom Œtylos' low walls contain,
LINE 734: And Helos, on the margin of the main.
LINE 735: These, o'er the bending ocean, Helen's cause,
LINE 736: In sixty ships with Menelaus draws:
LINE 737: Eager and loud from man to man he flies,
LINE 738: Revenge and fury flaming in his eyes;
LINE 739: While vainly fond, in fancy oft he hears
LINE 740: The fair one's grief, and sees her falling tears.
LINE 741: In ninety sail, from Pylos' sandy coast,
LINE 742: Nestor the sage conducts his chosen host:
LINE 743: From Amphigenia's ever-fruitful land,
LINE 744: Where Æpy high, and little Pteleon stand;
LINE 745: Where beauteous Arene her structures shows,
LINE 746: And Thryon's walls Alpheus' streams inclose:
LINE 747: And Dorion, famed for Thamyris' disgrace,
LINE 748: Superior once of all the tuneful race,
LINE 749: Till, vain of mortals' empty praise, he strove
LINE 750: To match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove!
LINE 751: Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride
LINE 752: The immortal Muses in their art defied.
LINE 753: The avenging Muses of the light of day
LINE 754: Deprived his eyes, and snatch'd his voice away;
LINE 755: No more his heavenly voice was heard to sing,
LINE 756: His hand no more awaked the silver string.
LINE 757: Where under high Cyllenè, crown'd with wood,
LINE 758: The shaded tomb of old Æpytus stood;
LINE 759: From Ripè, Stratie, Tegea's bordering towns,
LINE 760: The Phenean fields, and Orchomenian downs,
LINE 761: Where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove;
LINE 762: And Stymphelus with her surrounding grove;
LINE 763: Parrhasia, on her snowy cliffs reclined,
LINE 764: And high Enispè shook by wintry wind,
LINE 765: And fair Mantinea's ever-pleasing site;
LINE 766: In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite.
LINE 767: Bold Agapenor, glorious at their head,
LINE 768: (Ancæus' son) the mighty squadron led.
LINE 769: Their ships, supplied by Agamemnon's care,
LINE 770: Through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear;
LINE 771: The first to battle on the appointed plain,
LINE 772: But new to all the dangers of the main.
LINE 773: Those, where fair Elis and Buprasium join;
LINE 774: Whom Hyrmin, here, and Myrsinus confine,
LINE 775: And bounded there, where o'er the valleys rose
LINE 776: The Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows;
LINE 777: Beneath four chiefs (a numerous army) came:
LINE 778: The strength and glory of the Epean name.
LINE 779: In separate squadrons these their train divide,
LINE 780: Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide.
LINE 781: One was Amphimachus, and Thalpius one;
LINE 782: (Eurytus' this, and that Teätus' son;)
LINE 783: Diores sprung from Amarynceus' line;
LINE 784: And great Polyxenus, of force divine.
LINE 785: But those who view fair Elis o'er the seas
LINE 786: From the blest islands of the Echinades,
LINE 787: In forty vessels under Meges move,
LINE 788: Begot by Phyleus, the beloved of Jove:
LINE 789: To strong Dulichium from his sire he fled,
LINE 790: And thence to Troy his hardy warriors led.
LINE 791: Ulysses follow'd through the watery road,
LINE 792: A chief, in wisdom equal to a god.
LINE 793: With those whom Cephalenia's line inclosed,
LINE 794: Or till their fields along the coast opposed;
LINE 795: Or where fair Ithaca o'erlooks the floods,
LINE 796: Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods,
LINE 797: Where Ægilipa's rugged sides are seen,
LINE 798: Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green.
LINE 799: These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores,
LINE 800: Beneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores.
LINE 801: Thoas came next, Andræmon's valiant son,
LINE 802: From Pleuron's walls, and chalky Calydon,
LINE 803: And rough Pylene, and the Olenian steep,
LINE 804: And Chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep.
LINE 805: He led the warriors from the Ætolian shore,
LINE 806: For now the sons of Œneus were no more!
LINE 807: The glories of the mighty race were fled!
LINE 808: Œneus himself, and Meleager dead!
LINE 809: To Thoas' care now trust the martial train,
LINE 810: His forty vessels follow through the main.
LINE 811: Next, eighty barks the Cretan king commands,
LINE 812: Of Gnossus, Lyctus, and Gortyna's bands;
LINE 813: And those who dwell where Rhytion's domes arise,
LINE 814: Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies,
LINE 815: Or where by Phæstus silver Jardan runs;
LINE 816: Crete's hundred cities pour forth all her sons.
LINE 817: These march'd, Idomeneus, beneath thy care,
LINE 818: And Merion, dreadful as the god of war.
LINE 819: Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules,
LINE 820: Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas,
LINE 821: From Rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright,
LINE 822: Jalyssus, Lindus, and Camirus white.
LINE 823: His captive mother fierce Alcides bore
LINE 824: From Ephyr's walls and Sellè's winding shore,
LINE 825: Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain,
LINE 826: And saw their blooming warriors early slain.
LINE 827: The hero, when to manly years he grew,
LINE 828: Alcides' uncle, old Licymnius, slew;
LINE 829: For this, constrain'd to quit his native place,
LINE 830: And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race,
LINE 831: A fleet he built, and with a numerous train
LINE 832: Of willing exiles wander'd o'er the main;
LINE 833: Where, many seas and many sufferings past,
LINE 834: On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last:
LINE 835: There in three tribes divides his native band,
LINE 836: And rules them peaceful in a foreign land;
LINE 837: Increased and prosper'd in their new abodes
LINE 838: By mighty Jove, the sire of men and gods;
LINE 839: With joy they saw the growing empire rise,
LINE 840: And showers of wealth descending from the skies.
LINE 841: Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore,
LINE 842: Nireus, whom Agäle to Charopus bore,
LINE 843: Nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace,
LINE 844: The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;[104]
LINE 845: Pelides only match'd his early charms;
LINE 846: But few his troops, and small his strength in arms.
LINE 847: Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain,
LINE 848: Of those Calydnæ's sea-girt isles contain;
LINE 849: With them the youth of Nisyrus repair,
LINE 850: Casus the strong, and Crapathus the fair;
LINE 851: Cos, where Eurypylus possess'd the sway,
LINE 852: Till great Alcides made the realms obey:
LINE 853: These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring,
LINE 854: Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king.
LINE 855: Now, Muse, recount Pelasgic Argos' powers,
LINE 856: From Alos, Alopé, and Trechin's towers:
LINE 857: From Phthia's spacious vales; and Hella, bless'd
LINE 858: With female beauty far beyond the rest.
LINE 859: Full fifty ships beneath Achilles' care,
LINE 860: The Achaians, Myrmidons, Hellenians bear;
LINE 861: Thessalians all, though various in their name;
LINE 862: The same their nation, and their chief the same.
LINE 863: But now inglorious, stretch'd along the shore,
LINE 864: They hear the brazen voice of war no more;
LINE 865: No more the foe they face in dire array:
LINE 866: Close in his fleet the angry leader lay;
LINE 867: Since fair Briseïs from his arms was torn,
LINE 868: The noblest spoil from sack'd Lyrnessus borne,
LINE 869: Then, when the chief the Theban walls o'erthrew,
LINE 870: And the bold sons of great Evenus slew.
LINE 871: There mourn'd Achilles, plunged in depth of care,
LINE 872: But soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war.
LINE 873: To these the youth of Phylacè succeed,
LINE 874: Itona, famous for her fleecy breed,
LINE 875: And grassy Pteleon deck'd with cheerful greens,
LINE 876: The bowers of Ceres, and the sylvan scenes.
LINE 877: Sweet Pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown'd,
LINE 878: And Antron's watery dens, and cavern'd ground.
LINE 879: These own'd, as chief, Protesilas the brave,
LINE 880: Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave:
LINE 881: The first who boldly touch'd the Trojan shore,
LINE 882: And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore;
LINE 883: There lies, far distant from his native plain;
LINE 884: Unfinish'd his proud palaces remain,
LINE 885: And his sad consort beats her breast in vain.
LINE 886: His troops in forty ships Podarces led,
LINE 887: Iphiclus' son, and brother to the dead;
LINE 888: Nor he unworthy to command the host;
LINE 889: Yet still they mourn'd their ancient leader lost.
LINE 890: The men who Glaphyra's fair soil partake,
LINE 891: Where hills incircle Bœbe's lowly lake,
LINE 892: Where Phære hears the neighbouring waters fall,
LINE 893: Or proud Iölcus lifts her airy wall,
LINE 894: In ten black ships embark'd for Ilion's shore,
LINE 895: With bold Eumelus, whom Alcestè bore:
LINE 896: All Pelias' race Alcestè far outshined,
LINE 897: The grace and glory of the beauteous kind,
LINE 898: The troops Methonè or Thaumacia yields,
LINE 899: Olizon's rocks, or Melibœa's fields,
LINE 900: With Philoctetes sail'd whose matchless art
LINE 901: From the tough bow directs the feather'd dart.
LINE 902: Seven were his ships; each vessel fifty row,
LINE 903: Skill'd in his science of the dart and bow.
LINE 904: But he lay raging on the Lemnian ground,
LINE 905: A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound;
LINE 906: There groan'd the chief in agonizing pain,
LINE 907: Whom Greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.
LINE 908: His forces Medon led from Lemnos' shore,
LINE 909: Oïleus' son, whom beauteous Rhena bore.
LINE 910: The Œchalian race, in those high towers contain'd
LINE 911: Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reign'd,
LINE 912: Or where her humbler turrets Tricca rears,
LINE 913: Or where Ithome, rough with rocks, appears,
LINE 914: In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide,
LINE 915: Which Podalirius and Machaon guide.
LINE 916: To these his skill their parent-god imparts,
LINE 917: Divine professors of the healing arts.
LINE 918: The bold Ormenian and Asterian bands
LINE 919: In forty barks Eurypylus commands.
LINE 920: Where Titan hides his hoary head in snow,
LINE 921: And where Hyperia's silver fountains flow.
LINE 922: Thy troops, Argissa, Polypœtes leads,
LINE 923: And Eleon, shelter'd by Olympus' shades,
LINE 924: Gyrtonè's warriors; and where Orthè lies,
LINE 925: And Oloösson's chalky cliffs arise.
LINE 926: Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race,
LINE 927: The fruit of fair Hippodame's embrace,
LINE 928: (That day, when hurl'd from Pelion's cloudy head,
LINE 929: To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled)
LINE 930: With Polypœtes join'd in equal sway
LINE 931: Leonteus leads, and forty ships obey.
LINE 932: In twenty sail the bold Perrhæbians came
LINE 933: From Cyphus, Guneus was their leader's name.
LINE 934: With these the Enians join'd, and those who freeze
LINE 935: Where cold Dodona lifts her holy trees;
LINE 936: Or where the pleasing Titaresius glides,
LINE 937: And into Peneus rolls his easy tides;
LINE 938: Yet o'er the silvery surface pure they flow,
LINE 939: The sacred stream unmix'd with streams below,
LINE 940: Sacred and awful! from the dark abodes
LINE 941: Styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods!
LINE 942: Last, under Prothous the Magnesians stood,
LINE 943: (Prothous the swift, of old Tenthredon's blood;)
LINE 944: Who dwell where Pelion, crown'd with piny boughs,
LINE 945: Obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows;
LINE 946: Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus stray'd:
LINE 947: (The region stretch'd beneath his mighty shade:)
LINE 948: In forty sable barks they stemm'd the main;
LINE 949: Such were the chiefs, and such the Grecian train.
LINE 950: Say next, O Muse! of all Achaia breeds,
LINE 951: Who bravest fought, or rein'd the noblest steeds?
LINE 952: Eumelus' mares were foremost in the chase,
LINE 953: As eagles fleet, and of Pheretian race;
LINE 954: Bred where Pieria's fruitful fountains flow,
LINE 955: And train'd by him who bears the silver bow.
LINE 956: Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame,
LINE 957: Their height, their colour, and their age the same;
LINE 958: O'er fields of death they whirl the rapid car,
LINE 959: And break the ranks, and thunder through the war.
LINE 960: Ajax in arms the first renown acquired,
LINE 961: While stern Achilles in his wrath retired:
LINE 962: (His was the strength that mortal might exceeds,
LINE 963: And his the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds:)
LINE 964: But Thetis' son now shines in arms no more;
LINE 965: His troops, neglected on the sandy shore.
LINE 966: In empty air their sportive javelins throw,
LINE 967: Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow:
LINE 968: Unstain'd with blood his cover'd chariots stand;
LINE 969: The immortal coursers graze along the strand;
LINE 970: But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,
LINE 971: And, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.
LINE 972: Now, like a deluge, covering all around,
LINE 973: The shining armies sweep along the ground;
LINE 974: Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,
LINE 975: Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.
LINE 976: Earth groan'd beneath them; as when angry Jove
LINE 977: Hurls down the forky lightning from above,
LINE 978: On Arimé when he the thunder throws,
LINE 979: And fires Typhœus with redoubled blows,
LINE 980: Where Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,
LINE 981: Still feels the fury of the avenging god.
LINE 982: But various Iris, Jove's commands to bear,
LINE 983: Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;
LINE 984: In Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she found,
LINE 985: The old consulting, and the youths around.
LINE 986: Polites' shape, the monarch's son, she chose,
LINE 987: Who from Æsetes' tomb observed the foes,[105]
LINE 988: High on the mound; from whence in prospect lay
LINE 989: The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.
LINE 990: In this dissembled form, she hastes to bring
LINE 991: The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king.
LINE 992: "Cease to consult, the time for action calls;
LINE 993: War, horrid war, approaches to your walls!
LINE 994: Assembled armies oft have I beheld;
LINE 995: But ne'er till now such numbers charged a field:
LINE 996: Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand,
LINE 997: The moving squadrons blacken all the strand.
LINE 998: Thou, godlike Hector! all thy force employ,
LINE 999: Assemble all the united bands of Troy;
LINE 1000: In just array let every leader call
LINE 1001: The foreign troops: this day demands them all!"
LINE 1002: The voice divine the mighty chief alarms;
LINE 1003: The council breaks, the warriors rush to arms.
LINE 1004: The gates unfolding pour forth all their train,
LINE 1005: Nations on nations fill the dusky plain,
LINE 1006: Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground:
LINE 1007: The tumult thickens, and the skies resound.
LINE 1008: Amidst the plain, in sight of Ilion, stands
LINE 1009: A rising mount, the work of human hands;
LINE 1010: (This for Myrinne's tomb the immortals know,
LINE 1011: Though call'd Bateïa in the world below;)
LINE 1012: Beneath their chiefs in martial order here,
LINE 1013: The auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear.
LINE 1014: The godlike Hector, high above the rest,
LINE 1015: Shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest:
LINE 1016: In throngs around his native bands repair,
LINE 1017: And groves of lances glitter in the air.
LINE 1018: Divine Æneas brings the Dardan race,
LINE 1019: Anchises' son, by Venus' stolen embrace,
LINE 1020: Born in the shades of Ida's secret grove;
LINE 1021: (A mortal mixing with the queen of love;)
LINE 1022: Archilochus and Acamas divide
LINE 1023: The warrior's toils, and combat by his side.
LINE 1024: Who fair Zeleia's wealthy valleys till,[106]
LINE 1025: Fast by the foot of Ida's sacred hill,
LINE 1026: Or drink, Æsepus, of thy sable flood,
LINE 1027: Were led by Pandarus, of royal blood;
LINE 1028: To whom his art Apollo deign'd to show,
LINE 1029: Graced with the presents of his shafts and bow.
LINE 1030: From rich Apæsus and Adrestia's towers,
LINE 1031: High Teree's summits, and Pityea's bowers;
LINE 1032: From these the congregated troops obey
LINE 1033: Young Amphius and Adrastus' equal sway;
LINE 1034: Old Merops' sons; whom, skill'd in fates to come,
LINE 1035: The sire forewarn'd, and prophesied their doom:
LINE 1036: Fate urged them on! the sire forewarn'd in vain,
LINE 1037: They rush'd to war, and perish'd on the plain.
LINE 1038: From Practius' stream, Percotè's pasture lands,
LINE 1039: And Sestos and Abydos' neighbouring strands,
LINE 1040: From great Arisba's walls and Sellè's coast,
LINE 1041: Asius Hyrtacides conducts his host:
LINE 1042: High on his car he shakes the flowing reins,
LINE 1043: His fiery coursers thunder o'er the plains.
LINE 1044: The fierce Pelasgi next, in war renown'd,
LINE 1045: March from Larissa's ever-fertile ground:
LINE 1046: In equal arms their brother leaders shine,
LINE 1047: Hippothous bold, and Pyleus the divine.
LINE 1048: Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts,
LINE 1049: In dread array, from Thracia's wintry coasts;
LINE 1050: Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars,
LINE 1051: And Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.
LINE 1052: With great Euphemus the Ciconians move,
LINE 1053: Sprung from Trœzenian Ceüs, loved by Jove.
LINE 1054: Pyræchmes the Pæonian troops attend,
LINE 1055: Skill'd in the fight their crooked bows to bend;
LINE 1056: From Axius' ample bed he leads them on,
LINE 1057: Axius, that laves the distant Amydon,
LINE 1058: Axius, that swells with all his neighbouring rills,
LINE 1059: And wide around the floating region fills.
LINE 1060: The Paphlagonians Pylæmenes rules,
LINE 1061: Where rich Henetia breeds her savage mules,
LINE 1062: Where Erythinus' rising cliffs are seen,
LINE 1063: Thy groves of box, Cytorus! ever green,
LINE 1064: And where Ægialus and Cromna lie,
LINE 1065: And lofty Sesamus invades the sky,
LINE 1066: And where Parthenius, roll'd through banks of flowers,
LINE 1067: Reflects her bordering palaces and bowers.
LINE 1068: Here march'd in arms the Halizonian band,
LINE 1069: Whom Odius and Epistrophus command,
LINE 1070: From those far regions where the sun refines
LINE 1071: The ripening silver in Alybean mines.
LINE 1072: There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train,
LINE 1073: And augur Ennomus, inspired in vain;
LINE 1074: For stern Achilles lopp'd his sacred head,
LINE 1075: Roll'd down Scamander with the vulgar dead.
LINE 1076: Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite
LINE 1077: The Ascanian Phrygians, eager for the fight.
LINE 1078: Of those who round Mæonia's realms reside,
LINE 1079: Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide,
LINE 1080: Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake,
LINE 1081: Born on the banks of Gyges' silent lake.
LINE 1082: There, from the fields where wild Mæander flows,
LINE 1083: High Mycale, and Latmos' shady brows,
LINE 1084: And proud Miletus, came the Carian throngs,
LINE 1085: With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.[107]
LINE 1086: Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train,
LINE 1087: Naustes the bold, Amphimachus the vain,
LINE 1088: Who, trick'd with gold, and glittering on his car,
LINE 1089: Rode like a woman to the field of war.
LINE 1090: Fool that he was! by fierce Achilles slain,
LINE 1091: The river swept him to the briny main:
LINE 1092: There whelm'd with waves the gaudy warrior lies
LINE 1093: The valiant victor seized the golden prize.
LINE 1094: The forces last in fair array succeed,
LINE 1095: Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead
LINE 1096: The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields,
LINE 1097: Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields.
