LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.
LINE 3: Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the
LINE 4: gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the
LINE 5: combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Æneas
LINE 6: to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes
LINE 7: encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune.
LINE 8: Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of
LINE 9: killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles
LINE 10: pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.
LINE 11: The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.
LINE 12: Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood
LINE 13: Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;
LINE 14: While near impending from a neighbouring height,
LINE 15: Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.
LINE 16: Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call
LINE 17: The gods to council in the starry hall:
LINE 18: Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,
LINE 19: And summons all the senate of the skies.
LINE 20: These shining on, in long procession come
LINE 21: To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.
LINE 22: Not one was absent, not a rural power
LINE 23: That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;
LINE 24: Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,
LINE 25: Each azure sister of the silver flood;
LINE 26: All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps
LINE 27: His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.
LINE 28: On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,
LINE 29: (The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.
LINE 30: Even he whose trident sways the watery reign
LINE 31: Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,
LINE 32: Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,
LINE 33: And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:
LINE 34: "What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,
LINE 35: And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,
LINE 36: Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?
LINE 37: Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?
LINE 38: Already met, the louring hosts appear,
LINE 39: And death stands ardent on the edge of war."
LINE 40: "'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)
LINE 41: This day we call the council of the skies
LINE 42: In care of human race; even Jove's own eye
LINE 43: Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.
LINE 44: Far on Olympus' top in secret state
LINE 45: Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate
LINE 46: Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,
LINE 47: And as your minds direct, your succour lend
LINE 48: To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,
LINE 49: If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:
LINE 50: Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;
LINE 51: What can they now, if in his rage he rise?
LINE 52: Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall
LINE 53: May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."
LINE 54: He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.
LINE 55: On adverse parts the warring gods engage:
LINE 56: Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round
LINE 57: Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;
LINE 58: Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;
LINE 59: And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:
LINE 60: These to the fleet repair with instant flight;
LINE 61: The vessels tremble as the gods alight.
LINE 62: In aid of Troy, Latona, Phœbus came,
LINE 63: Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,
LINE 64: Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,
LINE 65: And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.
LINE 66: Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,
LINE 67: Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,
LINE 68: While great Achilles (terror of the plain),
LINE 69: Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.
LINE 70: Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;
LINE 71: Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;
LINE 72: Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,
LINE 73: And trembling see another god of war.
LINE 74: But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,
LINE 75: Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright
LINE 76: Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,
LINE 77: Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.
LINE 78: Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,
LINE 79: And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.
LINE 80: Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds
LINE 81: In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:
LINE 82: Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours
LINE 83: With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:
LINE 84: Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;
LINE 85: The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.
LINE 86: Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,
LINE 87: And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.
LINE 88: Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;
LINE 89: The forests wave, the mountains nod around;
LINE 90: Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods,
LINE 91: And from their sources boil her hundred floods.
LINE 92: Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,
LINE 93: And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.
LINE 94: Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,[260]
LINE 95: The infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,
LINE 96: Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay
LINE 97: His dark dominions open to the day,
LINE 98: And pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,
LINE 99: Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.[261]
LINE 100: [Illustration: ] THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE
LINE 101: Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend
LINE 102: The world's vast concave, when the gods contend.
LINE 103: First silver-shafted Phœbus took the plain
LINE 104: Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.
LINE 105: The god of arms his giant bulk display'd,
LINE 106: Opposed to Pallas, war's triumphant maid.
LINE 107: Against Latona march'd the son of May.
LINE 108: The quiver'd Dian, sister of the day,
LINE 109: (Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)
LINE 110: Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.
LINE 111: With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands
LINE 112: The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;
LINE 113: Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,
LINE 114: But called Scamander by the sons of earth.
LINE 115: While thus the gods in various league engage,
LINE 116: Achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage:
LINE 117: Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn'd
LINE 118: His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd;
LINE 119: And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd
LINE 120: To glut the god of battles with his blood.
LINE 121: Æneas was the first who dared to stay;
LINE 122: Apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,
LINE 123: But swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,
LINE 124: Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.
LINE 125: Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,
LINE 126: In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;
LINE 127: And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn
LINE 128: In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.
LINE 129: Then thus the hero of Anchises' strain:
LINE 130: "To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:
LINE 131: Already have I met, nor void of fear
LINE 132: Observed the fury of his flying spear;
LINE 133: From Ida's woods he chased us to the field,
LINE 134: Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd;
LINE 135: Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;
LINE 136: But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:
LINE 137: Else had I sunk oppress'd in fatal fight
LINE 138: By fierce Achilles and Minerva's might.
LINE 139: Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,
LINE 140: And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.
LINE 141: What mortal man Achilles can sustain?
LINE 142: The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,
LINE 143: And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.
LINE 144: Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,
LINE 145: Though strong in battle as a brazen tower."
LINE 146: To whom the son of Jove: "That god implore,
LINE 147: And be what great Achilles was before.
LINE 148: From heavenly Venus thou deriv'st thy strain,
LINE 149: And he but from a sister of the main;
LINE 150: An aged sea-god father of his line;
LINE 151: But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.
LINE 152: Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,
LINE 153: Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe."
LINE 154: This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,
LINE 155: Through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd:
LINE 156: His venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,
LINE 157: And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:
LINE 158: "Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,
LINE 159: Lo great Æneas rushing to the war!
LINE 160: Against Pelides he directs his course,
LINE 161: Phœbus impels, and Phœbus gives him force.
LINE 162: Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend
LINE 163: Our favour'd hero, let some power descend.
LINE 164: To guard his life, and add to his renown,
LINE 165: We, the great armament of heaven, came down.
LINE 166: Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,
LINE 167: That spun so short his life's illustrious line:[262]
LINE 168: But lest some adverse god now cross his way,
LINE 169: Give him to know what powers assist this day:
LINE 170: For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,
LINE 171: When heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?"[263]
LINE 172: Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make
LINE 173: The solid globe's eternal basis shake:
LINE 174: "Against the might of man, so feeble known,
LINE 175: Why should celestial powers exert their own?
LINE 176: Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,
LINE 177: And leave to war the fates of mortal men.
LINE 178: But if the armipotent, or god of light,
LINE 179: Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,
LINE 180: Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:
LINE 181: Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;
LINE 182: And these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,
LINE 183: Yield to our conquering arms the lower world."
LINE 184: Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,
LINE 185: Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.
LINE 186: Advanced upon the field there stood a mound
LINE 187: Of earth congested, wall'd, and trench'd around;
LINE 188: In elder times to guard Alcides made,
LINE 189: (The work of Trojans, with Minerva's aid,)
LINE 190: What time a vengeful monster of the main
LINE 191: Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.
LINE 192: Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,
LINE 193: With clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air:
LINE 194: The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,
LINE 195: Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.
LINE 196: In circle close each heavenly party sat,
LINE 197: Intent to form the future scheme of fate;
LINE 198: But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high
LINE 199: Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.
LINE 200: Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;
LINE 201: The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:
LINE 202: Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,
LINE 203: The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.
LINE 204: Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,
LINE 205: There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.
LINE 206: With towering strides Æneas first advanced;
LINE 207: The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:
LINE 208: Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,
LINE 209: And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.
LINE 210: Not so Pelides; furious to engage,
LINE 211: He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,
LINE 212: Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,
LINE 213: Though all in arms the peopled city rise,
LINE 214: Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;
LINE 215: Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,
LINE 216: To his bold spear the savage turns alone,
LINE 217: He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;
LINE 218: He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,
LINE 219: Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;
LINE 220: He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,
LINE 221: Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.
LINE 222: So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;
LINE 223: So stands Æneas, and his force defies.
LINE 224: Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun
LINE 225: The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:
LINE 226: "Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?
LINE 227: Seeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,
LINE 228: In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,
LINE 229: And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?
LINE 230: Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,
LINE 231: The partial monarch may refuse the prize;
LINE 232: Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:
LINE 233: And 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,
LINE 234: Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,
LINE 235: Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,
LINE 236: An ample forest, or a fair domain,
LINE 237: Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?
LINE 238: Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.
LINE 239: But can Achilles be so soon forgot?
LINE 240: Once (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear,
LINE 241: And then the great Æneas seem'd to fear:
LINE 242: With hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,
LINE 243: Nor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.
LINE 244: Her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;
LINE 245: Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:
LINE 246: In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;
LINE 247: 'Tis true, the great Æneas fled too fast.
LINE 248: Defrauded of my conquest once before,
LINE 249: What then I lost, the gods this day restore.
LINE 250: Go; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;
LINE 251: Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."
LINE 252: To this Anchises' son: "Such words employ
LINE 253: To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;
LINE 254: Such we disdain; the best may be defied
LINE 255: With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;
LINE 256: Unworthy the high race from which we came
LINE 257: Proclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:
LINE 258: Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;
LINE 259: Each goddess-born; half human, half divine.
LINE 260: Thetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,
LINE 261: And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:
LINE 262: For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,
LINE 263: 'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.
LINE 264: If yet thou further seek to learn my birth
LINE 265: (A tale resounded through the spacious earth)
LINE 266: Hear how the glorious origin we prove
LINE 267: From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:
LINE 268: Dardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,
LINE 269: (The city since of many-languaged men,)
LINE 270: Was not. The natives were content to till
LINE 271: The shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.[264]
LINE 272: From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,
LINE 273: The richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;
LINE 274: Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,
LINE 275: Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.
LINE 276: Boreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,
LINE 277: Conceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,
LINE 278: With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,
LINE 279: And coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:
LINE 280: Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,
LINE 281: Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.
LINE 282: These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,
LINE 283: Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;
LINE 284: And when along the level seas they flew,[265]
LINE 285: Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.
LINE 286: Such Erichthonius was: from him there came
LINE 287: The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.
LINE 288: Three sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,
LINE 289: Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:
LINE 290: The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,
LINE 291: Whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,
LINE 292: To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,
LINE 293: The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).
LINE 294: The two remaining sons the line divide:
LINE 295: First rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;
LINE 296: From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,
LINE 297: And Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;
LINE 298: Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;
LINE 299: And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.
LINE 300: From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he
LINE 301: Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.
LINE 302: Such is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,
LINE 303: But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:
LINE 304: He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,
LINE 305: All human courage gives, or takes away.
LINE 306: Long in the field of words we may contend,
LINE 307: Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,
LINE 308: Arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;
LINE 309: So voluble a weapon is the tongue;
LINE 310: Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,
LINE 311: For every man has equal strength to rail:
LINE 312: Women alone, when in the streets they jar,
LINE 313: Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;
LINE 314: Like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,
LINE 315: And vent their anger impotent and loud.
LINE 316: Cease then—Our business in the field of fight
LINE 317: Is not to question, but to prove our might.
LINE 318: To all those insults thou hast offer'd here,
LINE 319: Receive this answer: 'tis my flying spear."
LINE 320: He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,
LINE 321: Fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.
LINE 322: Far on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held
LINE 323: (To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,
LINE 324: That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear
LINE 325: Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.
LINE 326: His fears were vain; impenetrable charms
LINE 327: Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.
LINE 328: Through two strong plates the point its passage held,
LINE 329: But stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.
LINE 330: Five plates of various metal, various mould,
LINE 331: Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,
LINE 332: Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:
LINE 333: There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,
LINE 334: The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,
LINE 335: And pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,
LINE 336: Where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:
LINE 337: Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,
LINE 338: And the slight covering of expanded hides.
LINE 339: Æneas his contracted body bends,
LINE 340: And o'er him high the riven targe extends,
LINE 341: Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,
LINE 342: And at his back perceives the quivering spear:
LINE 343: A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;
LINE 344: And swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.
LINE 345: Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,
LINE 346: Draws his broad blade, and at Æneas flies:
LINE 347: Æneas rousing as the foe came on,
LINE 348: With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:
LINE 349: A mass enormous! which in modern days
LINE 350: No two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.
LINE 351: But ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground
LINE 352: Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:
LINE 353: "Lo! on the brink of fate Æneas stands,
LINE 354: An instant victim to Achilles' hands;
LINE 355: By Phœbus urged; but Phœbus has bestow'd
LINE 356: His aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.
LINE 357: And can ye see this righteous chief atone
LINE 358: With guiltless blood for vices not his own?
LINE 359: To all the gods his constant vows were paid;
LINE 360: Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.
LINE 361: Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign
LINE 362: The future father of the Dardan line:[266]
LINE 363: The first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,
LINE 364: And still his love descends on all the race:
LINE 365: For Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,
LINE 366: At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;
LINE 367: On great Æneas shall devolve the reign,
LINE 368: And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain."
LINE 369: The great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies
LINE 370: The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:
LINE 371: "Good as he is, to immolate or spare
LINE 372: The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;
LINE 373: Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,
LINE 374: Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;
LINE 375: Not even an instant to protract their fate,
LINE 376: Or save one member of the sinking state;
LINE 377: Till her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,
LINE 378: And even her crumbling ruins are no more."
LINE 379: The king of ocean to the fight descends,
LINE 380: Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,
LINE 381: Swift interposed between the warrior flies,
LINE 382: And casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.[267]
LINE 383: From great Æneas' shield the spear he drew,
LINE 384: And at his master's feet the weapon threw.
LINE 385: That done, with force divine he snatch'd on high
LINE 386: The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,
LINE 387: Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads
LINE 388: Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:
LINE 389: Till at the battle's utmost verge they light,
LINE 390: Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.
LINE 391: The godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)
LINE 392: With words like these the panting chief address'd:
LINE 393: "What power, O prince! with force inferior far,
LINE 394: Urged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?
LINE 395: Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,
LINE 396: Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.
LINE 397: But when the day decreed (for come it must)
LINE 398: Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,
LINE 399: Let then the furies of that arm be known,
LINE 400: Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own."
LINE 401: With that, he left him wondering as he lay,
LINE 402: Then from Achilles chased the mist away:
LINE 403: Sudden, returning with a stream of light,
LINE 404: The scene of war came rushing on his sight.
LINE 405: Then thus, amazed; "What wonders strike my mind!
LINE 406: My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,
LINE 407: Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,
LINE 408: That fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!
LINE 409: I thought alone with mortals to contend,
LINE 410: But powers celestial sure this foe defend.
LINE 411: Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,
LINE 412: Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.
LINE 413: Now then let others bleed." This said, aloud
LINE 414: He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:
LINE 415: "O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)
LINE 416: Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!
LINE 417: 'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,
LINE 418: To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:
LINE 419: No god can singly such a host engage,
LINE 420: Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.
LINE 421: But whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,
LINE 422: Whate'er of active force, or acting fire;
LINE 423: Whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;
LINE 424: All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.
LINE 425: Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,
LINE 426: And thin the squadrons with my single spear."
LINE 427: He said: nor less elate with martial joy,
LINE 428: The godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:
LINE 429: "Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;
LINE 430: Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.
LINE 431: Deeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words
LINE 432: Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:
LINE 433: The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,
LINE 434: But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.
LINE 435: Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,
LINE 436: Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;
LINE 437: That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,
LINE 438: And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand."
LINE 439: Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;
LINE 440: A wood of lances rises round his head,
LINE 441: Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,
LINE 442: They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.
LINE 443: But Phœbus warns him from high heaven to shun
LINE 444: The single fight with Thetis' godlike son;
LINE 445: More safe to combat in the mingled band,
LINE 446: Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.
LINE 447: He hears, obedient to the god of light,
LINE 448: And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.
LINE 449: Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,
LINE 450: On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.
LINE 451: First falls Iphytion, at his army's head;
LINE 452: Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;
LINE 453: From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,
LINE 454: His mother was a Nais, of the flood;
LINE 455: Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,
LINE 456: From Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.
LINE 457: Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:
LINE 458: The parted visage falls on equal sides:
LINE 459: With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;
LINE 460: While thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:
LINE 461: "Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth
LINE 462: Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;
LINE 463: Those beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,
LINE 464: And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,
LINE 465: Are thine no more."—The insulting hero said,
LINE 466: And left him sleeping in eternal shade.
LINE 467: The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,
LINE 468: And dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.
LINE 469: Demoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid
LINE 470: Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.
LINE 471: The impatient steel with full-descending sway
LINE 472: Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,
LINE 473: Resistless drove the batter'd skull before,
LINE 474: And dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.
LINE 475: This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,
LINE 476: Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:
LINE 477: The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound
LINE 478: The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.
LINE 479: He groans away his soul: not louder roars,
LINE 480: At Neptune's shrine on Helicè's high shores,
LINE 481: The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,
LINE 482: And ocean listens to the grateful sound.
LINE 483: Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,[268]
LINE 484: The youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:
LINE 485: (Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)
LINE 486: Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.
LINE 487: To the forbidden field he takes his flight,
LINE 488: In the first folly of a youthful knight,
LINE 489: To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,
LINE 490: But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:
LINE 491: Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,
LINE 492: And golden rings the double back-plate join'd
LINE 493: Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;
LINE 494: And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;
LINE 495: The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground
LINE 496: His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.
LINE 497: When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,
LINE 498: Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,
LINE 499: A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,
LINE 500: His soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:
LINE 501: Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,
LINE 502: And shook his javelin like a waving flame.
LINE 503: The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,
LINE 504: His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.
LINE 505: "And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;
LINE 506: The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!
LINE 507: No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear
LINE 508: Turn from each other in the walks of war."—
LINE 509: Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:
LINE 510: "Come, and receive thy fate!" He spake no more.
LINE 511: Hector, undaunted, thus: "Such words employ
LINE 512: To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:
LINE 513: Such we could give, defying and defied,
LINE 514: Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!
LINE 515: I know thy force to mine superior far;
LINE 516: But heaven alone confers success in war:
LINE 517: Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,
LINE 518: And give it entrance in a braver heart."
LINE 519: Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath
LINE 520: Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:
LINE 521: The bidden dart again to Hector flies,
LINE 522: And at the feet of its great master lies.
LINE 523: Achilles closes with his hated foe,
LINE 524: His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:
LINE 525: But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds
LINE 526: The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.
LINE 527: Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,
LINE 528: Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;
LINE 529: The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.
LINE 530: He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:
LINE 531: "Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight
LINE 532: Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.
LINE 533: But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,
LINE 534: If any power assist Achilles' hand.
LINE 535: Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day
LINE 536: Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay."
LINE 537: With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:
LINE 538: Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,
LINE 539: Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,
LINE 540: And stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.
LINE 541: Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,
LINE 542: And for the soul an ample passage made.
LINE 543: Laoganus and Dardanus expire,
LINE 544: The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;
LINE 545: Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,
LINE 546: Sunk in one instant to the nether world:
LINE 547: This difference only their sad fates afford
LINE 548: That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.
LINE 549: Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;
LINE 550: In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;
LINE 551: In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,
LINE 552: To spare a form, an age so like thy own!
LINE 553: Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,
LINE 554: E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!
LINE 555: While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,
LINE 556: The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;
LINE 557: The panting liver pours a flood of gore
LINE 558: That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.
LINE 559: Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:
LINE 560: The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.
LINE 561: Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,
LINE 562: Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;
LINE 563: Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,
LINE 564: The purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.
LINE 565: Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung
LINE 566: Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;
LINE 567: He dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,
LINE 568: And stood all impotent, expecting fate:
LINE 569: Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,
LINE 570: From his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:
LINE 571: Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,
LINE 572: And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.
LINE 573: Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,
LINE 574: (The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)
LINE 575: Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;
LINE 576: Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.
LINE 577: The squire, who saw expiring on the ground
LINE 578: His prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;
LINE 579: His back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,
LINE 580: And stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.
LINE 581: As when a flame the winding valley fills,
LINE 582: And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;
LINE 583: Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,
LINE 584: Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,
LINE 585: This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:
LINE 586: So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;
LINE 587: Around him wide, immense destruction pours
LINE 588: And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,
LINE 589: As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,
LINE 590: And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;
LINE 591: When round and round, with never-wearied pain,
LINE 592: The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:
LINE 593: So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,
LINE 594: Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,
LINE 595: Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,
LINE 596: Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:
LINE 597: The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;
LINE 598: And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.
LINE 599: High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,
LINE 600: All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:
LINE 601: Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;
LINE 602: Such is the lust of never-dying fame!
