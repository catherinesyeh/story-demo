LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
LINE 3: Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the
LINE 4: body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the
LINE 5: army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are
LINE 6: solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that
LINE 7: occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from
LINE 8: the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of
LINE 9: Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where
LINE 10: Briseïs laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately
LINE 11: refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his
LINE 12: friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He
LINE 13: arms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to
LINE 14: his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of
LINE 15: them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his
LINE 16: fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to
LINE 17: the combat.
LINE 18: The thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.
LINE 19: Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head
LINE 20: Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,
LINE 21: (With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
LINE 22: And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)
LINE 23: The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears
LINE 24: Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears
LINE 25: Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest
LINE 26: Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.
LINE 27: A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,
LINE 28: And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:
LINE 29: "Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know
LINE 30: It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;
LINE 31: Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd,
LINE 32: Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god."
LINE 33: Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;
LINE 34: Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;
LINE 35: Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,
LINE 36: And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.
LINE 37: Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,
LINE 38: And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;
LINE 39: From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,
LINE 40: And flash incessant like a stream of fire:
LINE 41: He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind
LINE 42: On all the immortal artist had design'd.
LINE 43: "Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine
LINE 44: With matchless art, confess the hand divine.
LINE 45: Now to the bloody battle let me bend:
LINE 46: But ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!
LINE 47: In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,
LINE 48: Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?"
LINE 49: "That unavailing care be laid aside,
LINE 50: (The azure goddess to her son replied,)
LINE 51: Whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain,
LINE 52: Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.
LINE 53: But go, Achilles, as affairs require,
LINE 54: Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:
LINE 55: Then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage,
LINE 56: And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!"
LINE 57: [Illustration: ] THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES
LINE 58: Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour'd
LINE 59: Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd
LINE 60: O'er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey,
LINE 61: Untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay.
LINE 62: Achilles to the strand obedient went:
LINE 63: The shores resounded with the voice he sent.
LINE 64: The heroes heard, and all the naval train
LINE 65: That tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main,
LINE 66: Alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound,
LINE 67: Frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd;
LINE 68: Studious to see the terror of the plain,
LINE 69: Long lost to battle, shine in arms again.
LINE 70: Tydides and Ulysses first appear,
LINE 71: Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;
LINE 72: These on the sacred seats of council placed,
LINE 73: The king of men, Atrides, came the last:
LINE 74: He too sore wounded by Agenor's son.
LINE 75: Achilles (rising in the midst) begun:
LINE 76: "O monarch! better far had been the fate
LINE 77: Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,
LINE 78: If (ere the day when by mad passion sway'd,
LINE 79: Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)
LINE 80: Preventing Dian had despatch'd her dart,
LINE 81: And shot the shining mischief to the heart!
LINE 82: Then many a hero had not press'd the shore,
LINE 83: Nor Troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore.
LINE 84: Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,
LINE 85: And sad posterity repeat the tale.
LINE 86: But this, no more the subject of debate,
LINE 87: Is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate.
LINE 88: Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I,
LINE 89: Burn with a fury that can never die?
LINE 90: Here then my anger ends: let war succeed,
LINE 91: And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.
LINE 92: Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight
LINE 93: Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!
LINE 94: I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,
LINE 95: Shall 'scape with transport, and with joy repose."
LINE 96: He said: his finish'd wrath with loud acclaim
LINE 97: The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides' name.
LINE 98: When thus, not rising from his lofty throne,
LINE 99: In state unmoved, the king of men begun:
LINE 100: "Hear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear!
LINE 101: And grant your monarch an impartial ear:
LINE 102: Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,
LINE 103: And let your rash, injurious clamours end:
LINE 104: Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,
LINE 105: Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.
LINE 106: Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:
LINE 107: Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,
LINE 108: With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day
LINE 109: When from Achilles' arms I forced the prey.
LINE 110: What then could I against the will of heaven?
LINE 111: Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;
LINE 112: She, Jove's dread daughter, fated to infest
LINE 113: The race of mortals, enter'd in my breast.
LINE 114: Not on the ground that haughty fury treads,
LINE 115: But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads
LINE 116: Of mighty men; inflicting as she goes
LINE 117: Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!
LINE 118: Of old, she stalk'd amid the bright abodes;
LINE 119: And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,
LINE 120: The world's great ruler, felt her venom'd dart;
LINE 121: Deceived by Juno's wiles, and female art:
LINE 122: For when Alcmena's nine long months were run,
LINE 123: And Jove expected his immortal son,
LINE 124: To gods and goddesses the unruly joy
LINE 125: He show'd, and vaunted of his matchless boy:
LINE 126: 'From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,
LINE 127: Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.'
LINE 128: Saturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth,
LINE 129: And fix dominion on the favour'd youth.
LINE 130: The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,
LINE 131: Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.
LINE 132: The joyful goddess, from Olympus' height,
LINE 133: Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:
LINE 134: Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus's wife;
LINE 135: She push'd her lingering infant into life:
LINE 136: Her charms Alcmena's coming labours stay,
LINE 137: And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.
LINE 138: Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;
LINE 139: 'A youth (said she) of Jove's immortal kind
LINE 140: Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,
LINE 141: And claims thy promise to be king of kings.'
LINE 142: Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;
LINE 143: Stung to the soul, he sorrow'd, and he raged.
LINE 144: From his ambrosial head, where perch'd she sate,
LINE 145: He snatch'd the fury-goddess of debate,
LINE 146: The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,
LINE 147: The immortal seats should ne'er behold her more;
LINE 148: And whirl'd her headlong down, for ever driven
LINE 149: From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:
LINE 150: Thence on the nether world the fury fell;
LINE 151: Ordain'd with man's contentious race to dwell.
LINE 152: Full oft the god his son's hard toils bemoan'd,
LINE 153: Cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan'd.[258]
LINE 154: Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,
LINE 155: While raging Hector heap'd our camps with dead.
LINE 156: What can the errors of my rage atone?
LINE 157: My martial troops, my treasures are thy own:
LINE 158: This instant from the navy shall be sent
LINE 159: Whate'er Ulysses promised at thy tent:
LINE 160: But thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,
LINE 161: Resume thy arms, and shine again in war."
LINE 162: "O king of nations! whose superior sway
LINE 163: (Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!
LINE 164: To keep or send the presents, be thy care;
LINE 165: To us, 'tis equal: all we ask is war.
LINE 166: While yet we talk, or but an instant shun
LINE 167: The fight, our glorious work remains undone.
LINE 168: Let every Greek, who sees my spear confound
LINE 169: The Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,
LINE 170: With emulation, what I act survey,
LINE 171: And learn from thence the business of the day."
LINE 172: The son of Peleus thus; and thus replies
LINE 173: The great in councils, Ithacus the wise:
LINE 174: "Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,
LINE 175: At least our armies claim repast and rest:
LINE 176: Long and laborious must the combat be,
LINE 177: When by the gods inspired, and led by thee.
LINE 178: Strength is derived from spirits and from blood,
LINE 179: And those augment by generous wine and food:
LINE 180: What boastful son of war, without that stay,
LINE 181: Can last a hero through a single day?
LINE 182: Courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,
LINE 183: Mere unsupported man must yield at length;
LINE 184: Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,
LINE 185: The drooping body will desert the mind:
LINE 186: But built anew with strength-conferring fare,
LINE 187: With limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.
LINE 188: Dismiss the people, then, and give command,
LINE 189: With strong repast to hearten every band;
LINE 190: But let the presents to Achilles made,
LINE 191: In full assembly of all Greece be laid.
LINE 192: The king of men shall rise in public sight,
LINE 193: And solemn swear (observant of the rite)
LINE 194: That, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,
LINE 195: Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
LINE 196: That done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,
LINE 197: And the full price of injured honour paid.
LINE 198: Stretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might
LINE 199: Beyond the bounds of reason and of right;
LINE 200: 'Tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,
LINE 201: To right with justice whom with power they wrong'd."
LINE 202: To him the monarch: "Just is thy decree,
LINE 203: Thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.
LINE 204: Each due atonement gladly I prepare;
LINE 205: And heaven regard me as I justly swear!
LINE 206: Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay,
LINE 207: Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay.
LINE 208: Till from the fleet our presents be convey'd,
LINE 209: And Jove attesting, the firm compact made.
LINE 210: A train of noble youths the charge shall bear;
LINE 211: These to select, Ulysses, be thy care:
LINE 212: In order rank'd let all our gifts appear,
LINE 213: And the fair train of captives close the rear:
LINE 214: Talthybius shall the victim boar convey,
LINE 215: Sacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day."
LINE 216: "For this (the stern Æacides replies)
LINE 217: Some less important season may suffice,
LINE 218: When the stern fury of the war is o'er,
LINE 219: And wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.
LINE 220: By Hector slain, their faces to the sky,
LINE 221: All grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:
LINE 222: Those call to war! and might my voice incite,
LINE 223: Now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:
LINE 224: Then, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,
LINE 225: And copious banquets, glad your weary souls.
LINE 226: Let not my palate know the taste of food,
LINE 227: Till my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood:
LINE 228: Pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,
LINE 229: And his cold feet are pointed to the door.
LINE 230: Revenge is all my soul! no meaner care,
LINE 231: Interest, or thought, has room to harbour there;
LINE 232: Destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,
LINE 233: And scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds."
LINE 234: "O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin'd,)
LINE 235: The best and bravest of the warrior kind!
LINE 236: Thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,
LINE 237: But old experience and calm wisdom mine.
LINE 238: Then hear my counsel, and to reason yield,
LINE 239: The bravest soon are satiate of the field;
LINE 240: Though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,
LINE 241: The bloody harvest brings but little gain:
LINE 242: The scale of conquest ever wavering lies,
LINE 243: Great Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!
LINE 244: The great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,
LINE 245: And endless were the grief, to weep for all.
LINE 246: Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?
LINE 247: Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:
LINE 248: Enough, when death demands the brave, to pay
LINE 249: The tribute of a melancholy day.
LINE 250: One chief with patience to the grave resign'd,
LINE 251: Our care devolves on others left behind.
LINE 252: Let generous food supplies of strength produce,
LINE 253: Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,
LINE 254: Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,
LINE 255: And pour new furies on the feebler foe.
LINE 256: Yet a short interval, and none shall dare
LINE 257: Expect a second summons to the war;
LINE 258: Who waits for that, the dire effects shall find,
LINE 259: If trembling in the ships he lags behind.
LINE 260: Embodied, to the battle let us bend,
LINE 261: And all at once on haughty Troy descend."
LINE 262: And now the delegates Ulysses sent,
LINE 263: To bear the presents from the royal tent:
LINE 264: The sons of Nestor, Phyleus' valiant heir,
LINE 265: Thias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,
LINE 266: With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,
LINE 267: And Melanippus, form'd the chosen train.
LINE 268: Swift as the word was given, the youths obey'd:
LINE 269: Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;
LINE 270: A row of six fair tripods then succeeds;
LINE 271: And twice the number of high-bounding steeds:
LINE 272: Seven captives next a lovely line compose;
LINE 273: The eighth Briseïs, like the blooming rose,
LINE 274: Closed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,
LINE 275: First of the train, the golden talents bore:
LINE 276: The rest in public view the chiefs dispose,
LINE 277: A splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:
LINE 278: The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord
LINE 279: Drew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:
LINE 280: The stubborn bristles from the victim's brow
LINE 281: He crops, and offering meditates his vow.
LINE 282: His hands uplifted to the attesting skies,
LINE 283: On heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.
LINE 284: The solemn words a deep attention draw,
LINE 285: And Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.
LINE 286: "Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,
LINE 287: All-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!
LINE 288: And mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,
LINE 289: And ye, fell furies of the realms of night,
LINE 290: Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
LINE 291: For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
LINE 292: The black-eyed maid inviolate removes,
LINE 293: Pure and unconscious of my manly loves.
LINE 294: If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,
LINE 295: And levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!"
LINE 296: With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;
LINE 297: The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;
LINE 298: The sacred herald rolls the victim slain
LINE 299: (A feast for fish) into the foaming main.
LINE 300: Then thus Achilles: "Hear, ye Greeks! and know
LINE 301: Whate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;
LINE 302: Not else Atrides could our rage inflame,
LINE 303: Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.
LINE 304: 'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,
LINE 305: That doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.
LINE 306: Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;
LINE 307: Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight."
LINE 308: The speedy council at his word adjourn'd:
LINE 309: To their black vessels all the Greeks return'd.
LINE 310: Achilles sought his tent. His train before
LINE 311: March'd onward, bending with the gifts they bore.
LINE 312: Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:
LINE 313: The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;
LINE 314: To their new seats the female captives move.
LINE 315: Briseïs, radiant as the queen of love,
LINE 316: Slow as she pass'd, beheld with sad survey
LINE 317: Where, gash'd with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.
LINE 318: Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,
LINE 319: Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;
LINE 320: All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes
LINE 321: Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:
LINE 322: "Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,
LINE 323: Once tender friend of my distracted mind!
LINE 324: I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;
LINE 325: Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!
LINE 326: What woes my wretched race of life attend!
LINE 327: Sorrows on sorrows, never doom'd to end!
LINE 328: The first loved consort of my virgin bed
LINE 329: Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:
LINE 330: My three brave brothers in one mournful day
LINE 331: All trod the dark, irremeable way:
LINE 332: Thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,
LINE 333: And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;
LINE 334: Achilles' care you promised I should prove,
LINE 335: The first, the dearest partner of his love;
LINE 336: That rites divine should ratify the band,
LINE 337: And make me empress in his native land.
LINE 338: Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,
LINE 339: For thee, that ever felt another's woe!"
LINE 340: Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,
LINE 341: Nor mourn'd Patroclus' fortunes, but their own.
LINE 342: The leaders press'd the chief on every side;
LINE 343: Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.
LINE 344: "If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care
LINE 345: Is bent to please him, this request forbear;
LINE 346: Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay
LINE 347: To grief and anguish one abstemious day."
LINE 348: He spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face:
LINE 349: Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus' race.
LINE 350: Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,
LINE 351: And Phœnix, strive to calm his grief and rage:
LINE 352: His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;
LINE 353: He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.
LINE 354: "Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)
LINE 355: Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:
LINE 356: Thy sweet society, thy winning care,
LINE 357: Once stay'd Achilles, rushing to the war.
LINE 358: But now, alas! to death's cold arms resign'd,
LINE 359: What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?
LINE 360: What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,
LINE 361: What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?
LINE 362: Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear
LINE 363: His son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.
LINE 364: What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,
LINE 365: My only offspring, sink into the grave?
LINE 366: If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,
LINE 367: Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)
LINE 368: I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;
LINE 369: Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his friend.
LINE 370: I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear
LINE 371: My tender orphan with a parent's care,
LINE 372: From Scyros' isle conduct him o'er the main,
LINE 373: And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,
LINE 374: The lofty palace, and the large domain.
LINE 375: For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;
LINE 376: Or drags a wretched life of age and care,
LINE 377: But till the news of my sad fate invades
LINE 378: His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades."
LINE 379: Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join'd,
LINE 380: Each stole a tear for what he left behind.
LINE 381: Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,
LINE 382: And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:
LINE 383: "Is then Achilles now no more thy care,
LINE 384: And dost thou thus desert the great in war?
LINE 385: Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,
LINE 386: All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:
LINE 387: Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress'd,
LINE 388: Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast."
LINE 389: He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,
LINE 390: Shot the descending goddess from above.
LINE 391: So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,
LINE 392: The wide air floating to her ample wings,
LINE 393: To great Achilles she her flight address'd,
LINE 394: And pour'd divine ambrosia in his breast,[259]
LINE 395: With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)
LINE 396: Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.
LINE 397: Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,
LINE 398: And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.
LINE 399: As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,
LINE 400: And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow;
LINE 401: From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,
LINE 402: Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:
LINE 403: So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,
LINE 404: Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;
LINE 405: Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,
LINE 406: Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;
LINE 407: Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;
LINE 408: With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,
LINE 409: Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,
LINE 410: His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;
LINE 411: Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,
LINE 412: Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.
LINE 413: Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,
LINE 414: His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;
LINE 415: He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay
LINE 416: O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.
LINE 417: The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;
LINE 418: Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;
LINE 419: The brazen sword a various baldric tied,
LINE 420: That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;
LINE 421: And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield
LINE 422: Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.
LINE 423: So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,
LINE 424: Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,
LINE 425: Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,
LINE 426: Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:
LINE 427: With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;
LINE 428: Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.
LINE 429: Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind
LINE 430: The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:
LINE 431: Like the red star, that from his flaming hair
LINE 432: Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;
LINE 433: So stream'd the golden honours from his head,
LINE 434: Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.
LINE 435: The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;
LINE 436: His arms he poises, and his motions tries;
LINE 437: Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,
LINE 438: And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
LINE 439: And now he shakes his great paternal spear,
LINE 440: Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,
LINE 441: From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire
LINE 442: Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;
LINE 443: A spear which stern Achilles only wields,
LINE 444: The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.
LINE 445: Automedon and Alcimus prepare
LINE 446: The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;
LINE 447: (The silver traces sweeping at their side;)
LINE 448: Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;
LINE 449: The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,
LINE 450: Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.
LINE 451: The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,
LINE 452: And swift ascended at one active bound.
LINE 453: All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire
LINE 454: Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;
LINE 455: Not brighter Phœbus in the ethereal way
LINE 456: Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.
LINE 457: High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,
LINE 458: And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:
LINE 459: "Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,
LINE 460: (Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)
LINE 461: Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,
LINE 462: And learn to make your master more your care:
LINE 463: Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,
LINE 464: Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."
LINE 465: The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,
LINE 466: Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:
LINE 467: Trembling he stood before the golden wain,
LINE 468: And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.
LINE 469: When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke
LINE 470: Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.
LINE 471: "Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear
LINE 472: Thy rage in safety through the files of war:
LINE 473: But come it will, the fatal time must come,
LINE 474: Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.
LINE 475: Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,
LINE 476: Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;
LINE 477: The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day
LINE 478: (Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms away.
LINE 479: No—could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,
LINE 480: Or beat the pinions of the western gale,
LINE 481: All were in vain—the Fates thy death demand,
LINE 482: Due to a mortal and immortal hand."
LINE 483: Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,
LINE 484: His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied
LINE 485: With unabated rage—"So let it be!
LINE 486: Portents and prodigies are lost on me.
LINE 487: I know my fate: to die, to see no more
LINE 488: My much-loved parents, and my native shore—
LINE 489: Enough—when heaven ordains, I sink in night:
LINE 490: Now perish Troy!" He said, and rush'd to fight.
