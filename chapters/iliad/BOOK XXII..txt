LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE DEATH OF HECTOR.
LINE 3: The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose
LINE 4: Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his
LINE 5: son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.
LINE 6: Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the
LINE 7: advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles
LINE 8: pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning
LINE 9: the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
LINE 10: She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and
LINE 11: is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of
LINE 12: Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries
LINE 13: reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into
LINE 14: the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds
LINE 15: her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and
LINE 16: lamentation.
LINE 17: The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls,
LINE 18: and on the battlements of Troy.
LINE 19: Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,
LINE 20: The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:
LINE 21: There safe they wipe the briny drops away,
LINE 22: And drown in bowls the labours of the day.
LINE 23: Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields
LINE 24: Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,
LINE 25: March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,
LINE 26: Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.
LINE 27: Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate
LINE 28: There fix'd he stood before the Scæan gate;
LINE 29: Still his bold arms determined to employ,
LINE 30: The guardian still of long-defended Troy.
LINE 31: Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:
LINE 32: (The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)
LINE 33: "And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,
LINE 34: With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?
LINE 35: For not to thee to know the gods is given,
LINE 36: Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.
LINE 37: What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?
LINE 38: Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:
LINE 39: Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,
LINE 40: While here thy frantic rage attacks a god."
LINE 41: The chief incensed—"Too partial god of day!
LINE 42: To check my conquests in the middle way:
LINE 43: How few in Ilion else had refuge found!
LINE 44: What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!
LINE 45: Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,
LINE 46: Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:
LINE 47: Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,
LINE 48: To cheat a mortal who repines in vain."
LINE 49: Then to the city, terrible and strong,
LINE 50: With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,
LINE 51: So the proud courser, victor of the prize,
LINE 52: To the near goal with double ardour flies.
LINE 53: Him, as he blazing shot across the field,
LINE 54: The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.
LINE 55: Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,[274]
LINE 56: Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,
LINE 57: Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),
LINE 58: And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;
LINE 59: Terrific glory! for his burning breath
LINE 60: Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.
LINE 61: So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:
LINE 62: He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;
LINE 63: He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;
LINE 64: He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:
LINE 65: The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,
LINE 66: Full at the Scæan gates expects the war;
LINE 67: While the sad father on the rampart stands,
LINE 68: And thus adjures him with extended hands:
LINE 69: "Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;
LINE 70: Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!
LINE 71: Methinks already I behold thee slain,
LINE 72: And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.
LINE 73: Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be
LINE 74: To all the gods no dearer than to me!
LINE 75: Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,
LINE 76: And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.
LINE 77: How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,
LINE 78: Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:
LINE 79: Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles
LINE 80: To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.
LINE 81: Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,
LINE 82: Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,
LINE 83: And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!
LINE 84: Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,
LINE 85: What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!
LINE 86: (Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,
LINE 87: Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)
LINE 88: But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,
LINE 89: All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;
LINE 90: What sorrows then must their sad mother know,
LINE 91: What anguish I? unutterable woe!
LINE 92: Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,
LINE 93: Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.
LINE 94: Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;
LINE 95: And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!
LINE 96: Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave
LINE 97: Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.
LINE 98: Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;
LINE 99: While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,
LINE 100: Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage
LINE 101: (All trembling on the verge of helpless age)
LINE 102: Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!
LINE 103: The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:
LINE 104: To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,
LINE 105: And number all his days by miseries!
LINE 106: My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,
LINE 107: My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,
LINE 108: My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;
LINE 109: These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!
LINE 110: Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,
LINE 111: The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,
LINE 112: (Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,
LINE 113: And stain the pavement of my regal hall;
LINE 114: Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,
LINE 115: Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.
LINE 116: Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;
LINE 117: Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.
LINE 118: Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,
LINE 119: Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.
LINE 120: But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,
LINE 121: Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,
LINE 122: In dust the reverend lineaments deform,
LINE 123: And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:
LINE 124: This, this is misery! the last, the worse,
LINE 125: That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!"
LINE 126: He said, and acting what no words could say,
LINE 127: Rent from his head the silver locks away.
LINE 128: With him the mournful mother bears a part;
LINE 129: Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.
LINE 130: The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;
LINE 131: And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:
LINE 132: "Have mercy on me, O my son! revere
LINE 133: The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!
LINE 134: If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,
LINE 135: Or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;
LINE 136: Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,
LINE 137: But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.
LINE 138: Against his rage if singly thou proceed,
LINE 139: Should'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,
LINE 140: Nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,
LINE 141: Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!
LINE 142: Far from our pious rites those dear remains
LINE 143: Must feast the vultures on the naked plains."
LINE 144: So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;
LINE 145: But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;
LINE 146: Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance
LINE 147: Expects the hero's terrible advance.
LINE 148: So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake
LINE 149: Beholds the traveller approach the brake;
LINE 150: When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
LINE 151: Have gather'd half the poisons of the plains;
LINE 152: He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,
LINE 153: And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.
LINE 154: Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,
LINE 155: He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:[275]
LINE 156: "Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?
LINE 157: Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:
LINE 158: Shall proud Polydamas before the gate
LINE 159: Proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,
LINE 160: Which timely follow'd but the former night,
LINE 161: What numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?
LINE 162: That wise advice rejected with disdain,
LINE 163: I feel my folly in my people slain.
LINE 164: Methinks my suffering country's voice I hear,
LINE 165: But most her worthless sons insult my ear,
LINE 166: On my rash courage charge the chance of war,
LINE 167: And blame those virtues which they cannot share.
LINE 168: No—if I e'er return, return I must
LINE 169: Glorious, my country's terror laid in dust:
LINE 170: Or if I perish, let her see me fall
LINE 171: In field at least, and fighting for her wall.
LINE 172: And yet suppose these measures I forego,
LINE 173: Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,
LINE 174: The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,
LINE 175: And treat on terms of peace to save the town:
LINE 176: The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd
LINE 177: (Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)
LINE 178: With honourable justice to restore:
LINE 179: And add half Ilion's yet remaining store,
LINE 180: Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece
LINE 181: May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.
LINE 182: But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,
LINE 183: What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,
LINE 184: But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?
LINE 185: We greet not here, as man conversing man,
LINE 186: Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;
LINE 187: No season now for calm familiar talk,
LINE 188: Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:
LINE 189: War is our business, but to whom is given
LINE 190: To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!"
LINE 191: Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;
LINE 192: His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;
LINE 193: The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,
LINE 194: Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;
LINE 195: And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,
LINE 196: Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.
LINE 197: As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,
LINE 198: Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.
LINE 199: He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:
LINE 200: Achilles follows like the winged wind.
LINE 201: Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
LINE 202: (The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),
LINE 203: Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,
LINE 204: Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,
LINE 205: With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,
LINE 206: And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:
LINE 207: No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,
LINE 208: One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:
LINE 209: Now circling round the walls their course maintain,
LINE 210: Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;
LINE 211: Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,
LINE 212: (A wider compass,) smoke along the road.
LINE 213: Next by Scamander's double source they bound,
LINE 214: Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;
LINE 215: This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,
LINE 216: With exhalations steaming to the skies;
LINE 217: That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,
LINE 218: Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:
LINE 219: Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,
LINE 220: Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;
LINE 221: Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)
LINE 222: Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.[276]
LINE 223: By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:
LINE 224: (The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)
LINE 225: Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,
LINE 226: No vulgar victim must reward the day:
LINE 227: (Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)
LINE 228: The prize contended was great Hector's life.
LINE 229: As when some hero's funerals are decreed
LINE 230: In grateful honour of the mighty dead;
LINE 231: Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
LINE 232: (Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)
LINE 233: The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,
LINE 234: And with them turns the raised spectator's soul:
LINE 235: Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.
LINE 236: The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;
LINE 237: To whom, while eager on the chase they look,
LINE 238: The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:
LINE 239: "Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,
LINE 240: Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!
LINE 241: My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;
LINE 242: Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,
LINE 243: Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,
LINE 244: From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:
LINE 245: Now see him flying; to his fears resign'd,
LINE 246: And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.
LINE 247: Consult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)
LINE 248: Whether to snatch him from impending fate,
LINE 249: Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,
LINE 250: (Good as he is) the lot imposed on man."
LINE 251: Then Pallas thus: "Shall he whose vengeance forms
LINE 252: The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,
LINE 253: Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?
LINE 254: A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!
LINE 255: And will no murmurs fill the courts above?
LINE 256: No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?"
LINE 257: "Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,
LINE 258: Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way."
LINE 259: Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,
LINE 260: And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.
LINE 261: As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,
LINE 262: The well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,
LINE 263: In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,
LINE 264: Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;
LINE 265: Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,
LINE 266: The certain hound his various maze pursues.
LINE 267: Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,
LINE 268: There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.
LINE 269: Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,
LINE 270: And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,
LINE 271: (Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,
LINE 272: From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)
LINE 273: So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:
LINE 274: He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.
LINE 275: As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,
LINE 276: One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,
LINE 277: Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,
LINE 278: Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:
LINE 279: No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:
LINE 280: While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.
LINE 281: What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force
LINE 282: With fate itself so long to hold the course?
LINE 283: Phœbus it was; who, in his latest hour,
LINE 284: Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:
LINE 285: And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance
LINE 286: Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,
LINE 287: Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,
LINE 288: And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.
LINE 289: Jove lifts the golden balances, that show
LINE 290: The fates of mortal men, and things below:
LINE 291: Here each contending hero's lot he tries,
LINE 292: And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.
LINE 293: Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;
LINE 294: Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.
LINE 295: Then Phœbus left him. Fierce Minerva flies
LINE 296: To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:
LINE 297: "O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,
LINE 298: And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.
LINE 299: Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,
LINE 300: Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,
LINE 301: Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,
LINE 302: Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.
LINE 303: See, where in vain he supplicates above,
LINE 304: Roll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;
LINE 305: Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,
LINE 306: And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun."
LINE 307: Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
LINE 308: Obey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined
LINE 309: While like Deiphobus the martial dame
LINE 310: (Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),
LINE 311: In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side
LINE 312: Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:
LINE 313: "Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight
LINE 314: Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:
LINE 315: It fits us now a noble stand to make,
LINE 316: And here, as brothers, equal fates partake."
LINE 317: Then he: "O prince! allied in blood and fame,
LINE 318: Dearer than all that own a brother's name;
LINE 319: Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,
LINE 320: Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!
LINE 321: Since you, of all our numerous race alone
LINE 322: Defend my life, regardless of your own."
LINE 323: Again the goddess: "Much my father's prayer,
LINE 324: And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:
LINE 325: My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,
LINE 326: But stronger love impell'd, and I obey.
LINE 327: Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,
LINE 328: Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;
LINE 329: Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,
LINE 330: Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield."
LINE 331: Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:
LINE 332: The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.
LINE 333: Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:
LINE 334: His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:
LINE 335: "Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd
LINE 336: Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.
LINE 337: But now some god within me bids me try
LINE 338: Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.
LINE 339: Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,
LINE 340: And for a moment's space suspend the day;
LINE 341: Let Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate
LINE 342: The just conditions of this stern debate,
LINE 343: (Eternal witnesses of all below,
LINE 344: And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)
LINE 345: To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,
LINE 346: Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,
LINE 347: No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;
LINE 348: Stripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)
LINE 349: The rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:
LINE 350: Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more."
LINE 351: "Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,
LINE 352: While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),
LINE 353: Detested as thou art, and ought to be,
LINE 354: Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:
LINE 355: Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,
LINE 356: Such leagues as men and furious lions join,
LINE 357: To such I call the gods! one constant state
LINE 358: Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:
LINE 359: No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,
LINE 360: Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.
LINE 361: Rouse then thy forces this important hour,
LINE 362: Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.
LINE 363: No further subterfuge, no further chance;
LINE 364: 'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.
LINE 365: Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,
LINE 366: Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death."
LINE 367: He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;
LINE 368: But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:
LINE 369: He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear
LINE 370: Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.
LINE 371: Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,
LINE 372: Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,
LINE 373: Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,
LINE 374: Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.
LINE 375: "The life you boasted to that javelin given,
LINE 376: Prince! you have miss'd. My fate depends on Heaven,
LINE 377: To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,
LINE 378: Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.
LINE 379: Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,
LINE 380: And with false terrors sink another's mind.
LINE 381: But know, whatever fate I am to try,
LINE 382: By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.
LINE 383: I shall not fall a fugitive at least,
LINE 384: My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.
LINE 385: But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart
LINE 386: End all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart."
LINE 387: The weapon flew, its course unerring held,
LINE 388: Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd
LINE 389: The mortal dart; resulting with a bound
LINE 390: From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.
LINE 391: Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,
LINE 392: Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;
LINE 393: He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear—
LINE 394: In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.
LINE 395: All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;
LINE 396: "'Tis so—Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!
LINE 397: I deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call,
LINE 398: But he secure lies guarded in the wall.
LINE 399: A god deceived me; Pallas, 'twas thy deed,
LINE 400: Death and black fate approach! 'tis I must bleed.
LINE 401: No refuge now, no succour from above,
LINE 402: Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,
LINE 403: Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!
LINE 404: 'Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:
LINE 405: Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,
LINE 406: Let future ages hear it, and admire!"
LINE 407: Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,
LINE 408: And, all collected, on Achilles flew.
LINE 409: So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,
LINE 410: Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
LINE 411: Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:
LINE 412: Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,
LINE 413: Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone
LINE 414: The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.
LINE 415: Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)
LINE 416: And as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.
LINE 417: As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,[277]
LINE 418: Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,
LINE 419: When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:
LINE 420: So shone the point of great Achilles' spear.
LINE 421: In his right hand he waves the weapon round,
LINE 422: Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;
LINE 423: But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore
LINE 424: Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.
LINE 425: One space at length he spies, to let in fate,
LINE 426: Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
LINE 427: Gave entrance: through that penetrable part
LINE 428: Furious he drove the well-directed dart:
LINE 429: Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power
LINE 430: Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.
LINE 431: Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,
LINE 432: While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:
LINE 433: "At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,
LINE 434: Who fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:
LINE 435: Then, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel;
LINE 436: Achilles absent was Achilles still:
LINE 437: Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,
LINE 438: Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.
LINE 439: Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,
LINE 440: For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd:
LINE 441: While cast to all the rage of hostile power,
LINE 442: Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour."
LINE 443: Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:
LINE 444: "By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!
LINE 445: By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;
LINE 446: Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!
LINE 447: The common rites of sepulture bestow,
LINE 448: To soothe a father's and a mother's woe:
LINE 449: Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,
LINE 450: And Hector's ashes in his country rest."
LINE 451: "No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;
LINE 452: (Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)
LINE 453: Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,
LINE 454: Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.
LINE 455: Could I myself the bloody banquet join!
LINE 456: No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.
LINE 457: Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,
LINE 458: And giving thousands, offer thousands more;
LINE 459: Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,
LINE 460: Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:
LINE 461: Their Hector on the pile they should not see,
LINE 462: Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee."
LINE 463: Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:
LINE 464: "Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:
LINE 465: The Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,
LINE 466: And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.
LINE 467: Yet think, a day will come, when fate's decree
LINE 468: And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;
LINE 469: Phœbus and Paris shall avenge my fate,
LINE 470: And stretch thee here before the Scæan gate."[278]
LINE 471: He ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
LINE 472: And his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death;
LINE 473: To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,
LINE 474: (The manly body left a load of clay,)
LINE 475: And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,
LINE 476: A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
LINE 477: Achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes
LINE 478: O'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:
LINE 479: "Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,
LINE 480: I follow thee"—He said, and stripp'd the slain.
LINE 481: Then forcing backward from the gaping wound
LINE 482: The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.
LINE 483: The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes
LINE 484: His manly beauty and superior size;
LINE 485: While some, ignobler, the great dead deface
LINE 486: With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:
LINE 487: "How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late
LINE 488: Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter'd fate!"
LINE 489: High o'er the slain the great Achilles stands,
LINE 490: Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;
LINE 491: And thus aloud, while all the host attends:
LINE 492: "Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!
LINE 493: Since now at length the powerful will of heaven
LINE 494: The dire destroyer to our arm has given,
LINE 495: Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!
LINE 496: See, if already their deserted towers
LINE 497: Are left unmann'd; or if they yet retain
LINE 498: The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.
LINE 499: But what is Troy, or glory what to me?
LINE 500: Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,
LINE 501: Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal'd his eyes;
LINE 502: Unwept, unhonour'd, uninterr'd he lies!
LINE 503: Can his dear image from my soul depart,
LINE 504: Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?
LINE 505: If in the melancholy shades below,
LINE 506: The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,
LINE 507: Yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay'd,
LINE 508: Burn on through death, and animate my shade.
LINE 509: Meanwhile, ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring
LINE 510: The corpse of Hector, and your pæans sing.
LINE 511: Be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,
LINE 512: "Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.""
LINE 513: Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;
LINE 514: (Unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)
LINE 515: The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound
LINE 516: With thongs inserted through the double wound;
LINE 517: These fix'd up high behind the rolling wain,
LINE 518: His graceful head was trail'd along the plain.
LINE 519: Proud on his car the insulting victor stood,
LINE 520: And bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.
LINE 521: He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;
LINE 522: The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.
LINE 523: Now lost is all that formidable air;
LINE 524: The face divine, and long-descending hair,
LINE 525: Purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;
LINE 526: Deform'd, dishonour'd, in his native land,
LINE 527: Given to the rage of an insulting throng,
LINE 528: And, in his parents' sight, now dragg'd along!
LINE 529: The mother first beheld with sad survey;
LINE 530: She rent her tresses, venerable grey,
LINE 531: And cast, far off, the regal veils away.
LINE 532: With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,
LINE 533: While the sad father answers groans with groans,
LINE 534: Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,
LINE 535: And the whole city wears one face of woe:
LINE 536: No less than if the rage of hostile fires,
LINE 537: From her foundations curling to her spires,
LINE 538: O'er the proud citadel at length should rise,
LINE 539: And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.
LINE 540: The wretched monarch of the falling state,
LINE 541: Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.
LINE 542: Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,
LINE 543: While strong affliction gives the feeble force:
LINE 544: Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,
LINE 545: In all the raging impotence of woe.
LINE 546: At length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,
LINE 547: Imploring all, and naming one by one:
LINE 548: "Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;
LINE 549: I, only I, will issue from your walls
LINE 550: (Guide or companion, friends! I ask ye none),
LINE 551: And bow before the murderer of my son.
LINE 552: My grief perhaps his pity may engage;
LINE 553: Perhaps at least he may respect my age.
LINE 554: He has a father too; a man like me;
LINE 555: One, not exempt from age and misery
LINE 556: (Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace
LINE 557: Begot this pest of me, and all my race).
LINE 558: How many valiant sons, in early bloom,
LINE 559: Has that cursed hand sent headlong to the tomb!
LINE 560: Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)
LINE 561: Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.
LINE 562: O had thy gentle spirit pass'd in peace,
LINE 563: The son expiring in the sire's embrace,
LINE 564: While both thy parents wept the fatal hour,
LINE 565: And, bending o'er thee, mix'd the tender shower!
LINE 566: Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,
LINE 567: To melt in full satiety of grief!"
LINE 568: Thus wail'd the father, grovelling on the ground,
LINE 569: And all the eyes of Ilion stream'd around.
LINE 570: Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:
LINE 571: (A mourning princess, and a train in tears;)
LINE 572: "Ah why has Heaven prolong'd this hated breath,
LINE 573: Patient of horrors, to behold thy death?
LINE 574: O Hector! late thy parents' pride and joy,
LINE 575: The boast of nations! the defence of Troy!
LINE 576: To whom her safety and her fame she owed;
LINE 577: Her chief, her hero, and almost her god!
LINE 578: O fatal change! become in one sad day
LINE 579: A senseless corse! inanimated clay!"
LINE 580: But not as yet the fatal news had spread
LINE 581: To fair Andromache, of Hector dead;
LINE 582: As yet no messenger had told his fate,
LINE 583: Not e'en his stay without the Scæan gate.
LINE 584: Far in the close recesses of the dome,
LINE 585: Pensive she plied the melancholy loom;
LINE 586: A growing work employ'd her secret hours,
LINE 587: Confusedly gay with intermingled flowers.
LINE 588: Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,
LINE 589: The bath preparing for her lord's return
LINE 590: In vain; alas! her lord returns no more;
LINE 591: Unbathed he lies, and bleeds along the shore!
LINE 592: Now from the walls the clamours reach her ear,
LINE 593: And all her members shake with sudden fear:
LINE 594: Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls,
LINE 595: And thus, astonish'd, to her maids she calls:
LINE 596: [Illustration: ] THE BATH
LINE 597: "Ah follow me! (she cried) what plaintive noise
LINE 598: Invades my ear? 'Tis sure my mother's voice.
LINE 599: My faltering knees their trembling frame desert,
LINE 600: A pulse unusual flutters at my heart;
LINE 601: Some strange disaster, some reverse of fate
LINE 602: (Ye gods avert it!) threats the Trojan state.
LINE 603: Far be the omen which my thoughts suggest!
LINE 604: But much I fear my Hector's dauntless breast
LINE 605: Confronts Achilles; chased along the plain,
LINE 606: Shut from our walls! I fear, I fear him slain!
LINE 607: Safe in the crowd he ever scorn'd to wait,
LINE 608: And sought for glory in the jaws of fate:
LINE 609: Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath,
LINE 610: Now quench'd for ever in the arms of death."
LINE 611: She spoke: and furious, with distracted pace,
LINE 612: Fears in her heart, and anguish in her face,
LINE 613: Flies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue),
LINE 614: And mounts the walls, and sends around her view.
LINE 615: Too soon her eyes the killing object found,
LINE 616: The godlike Hector dragg'd along the ground.
LINE 617: A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:
LINE 618: She faints, she falls; her breath, her colour flies.
LINE 619: Her hair's fair ornaments, the braids that bound,
LINE 620: The net that held them, and the wreath that crown'd,
LINE 621: The veil and diadem flew far away
LINE 622: (The gift of Venus on her bridal day).
LINE 623: Around a train of weeping sisters stands,
LINE 624: To raise her sinking with assistant hands.
LINE 625: Scarce from the verge of death recall'd, again
LINE 626: She faints, or but recovers to complain.
LINE 627: [Illustration: ] ANDROMACHE FAINTING ON THE WALL
LINE 628: "O wretched husband of a wretched wife!
LINE 629: Born with one fate, to one unhappy life!
LINE 630: For sure one star its baneful beam display'd
LINE 631: On Priam's roof, and Hippoplacia's shade.
LINE 632: From different parents, different climes we came.
LINE 633: At different periods, yet our fate the same!
LINE 634: Why was my birth to great Aëtion owed,
LINE 635: And why was all that tender care bestow'd?
LINE 636: Would I had never been!—O thou, the ghost
LINE 637: Of my dead husband! miserably lost!
LINE 638: Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
LINE 639: And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!
LINE 640: An only child, once comfort of my pains,
LINE 641: Sad product now of hapless love, remains!
LINE 642: No more to smile upon his sire; no friend
LINE 643: To help him now! no father to defend!
LINE 644: For should he 'scape the sword, the common doom,
LINE 645: What wrongs attend him, and what griefs to come!
LINE 646: Even from his own paternal roof expell'd,
LINE 647: Some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field.
LINE 648: The day, that to the shades the father sends,
LINE 649: Robs the sad orphan of his father's friends:
LINE 650: He, wretched outcast of mankind! appears
LINE 651: For ever sad, for ever bathed in tears;
LINE 652: Amongst the happy, unregarded, he
LINE 653: Hangs on the robe, or trembles at the knee,
LINE 654: While those his father's former bounty fed
LINE 655: Nor reach the goblet, nor divide the bread:
LINE 656: The kindest but his present wants allay,
LINE 657: To leave him wretched the succeeding day.
LINE 658: Frugal compassion! Heedless, they who boast
LINE 659: Both parents still, nor feel what he has lost,
LINE 660: Shall cry, 'Begone! thy father feasts not here:'
LINE 661: The wretch obeys, retiring with a tear.
LINE 662: Thus wretched, thus retiring all in tears,
LINE 663: To my sad soul Astyanax appears!
LINE 664: Forced by repeated insults to return,
LINE 665: And to his widow'd mother vainly mourn:
LINE 666: He, who, with tender delicacy bred,
LINE 667: With princes sported, and on dainties fed,
LINE 668: And when still evening gave him up to rest,
LINE 669: Sunk soft in down upon the nurse's breast,
LINE 670: Must—ah what must he not? Whom Ilion calls
LINE 671: Astyanax, from her well-guarded walls,[279]
LINE 672: Is now that name no more, unhappy boy!
LINE 673: Since now no more thy father guards his Troy.
LINE 674: But thou, my Hector, liest exposed in air,
LINE 675: Far from thy parents' and thy consort's care;
LINE 676: Whose hand in vain, directed by her love,
LINE 677: The martial scarf and robe of triumph wove.
LINE 678: Now to devouring flames be these a prey,
LINE 679: Useless to thee, from this accursed day!
LINE 680: Yet let the sacrifice at least be paid,
LINE 681: An honour to the living, not the dead!"
LINE 682: So spake the mournful dame: her matrons hear, Sigh back her sighs, and
LINE 683: answer tear with tear.
