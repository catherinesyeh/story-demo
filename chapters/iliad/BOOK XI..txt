LINE 1: ARGUMENT
LINE 2: THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.
LINE 3: Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector
LINE 4: prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva
LINE 5: give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is
LINE 6: commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the
LINE 7: engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.
LINE 8: He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a
LINE 9: stop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is
LINE 10: obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,
LINE 11: wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.
LINE 12: Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and
LINE 13: rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the
LINE 14: army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in
LINE 15: Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)
LINE 16: sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that
LINE 17: manner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the
LINE 18: accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he
LINE 19: remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight
LINE 20: for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in
LINE 21: Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also
LINE 22: wounded, and assists him in that distress.
LINE 23: This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and
LINE 24: the same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended
LINE 25: through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,
LINE 26: seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in
LINE 27: the field near the monument of Ilus.
LINE 28: The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,[219]
LINE 29: Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;
LINE 30: With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
LINE 31: And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:
LINE 32: When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,
LINE 33: The torch of discord blazing in her hand,
LINE 34: Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,
LINE 35: And, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.
LINE 36: High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand
LINE 37: She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.
LINE 38: Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,
LINE 39: Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,
LINE 40: Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng
LINE 41: With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:
LINE 42: The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms
LINE 43: Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.
LINE 44: No more they sigh, inglorious to return,
LINE 45: But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.
LINE 46: [Illustration: ] THE DESCENT OF DISCORD
LINE 47: The king of men his hardy host inspires
LINE 48: With loud command, with great example fires!
LINE 49: Himself first rose, himself before the rest
LINE 50: His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,
LINE 51: And first he cased his manly legs around
LINE 52: In shining greaves with silver buckles bound;
LINE 53: The beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,
LINE 54: The same which once king Cinyras possess'd:
LINE 55: (The fame of Greece and her assembled host
LINE 56: Had reach'd that monarch on the Cyprian coast;
LINE 57: 'Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,
LINE 58: This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)
LINE 59: Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,
LINE 60: Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;
LINE 61: Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,
LINE 62: Whose imitated scales against the skies
LINE 63: Reflected various light, and arching bow'd,
LINE 64: Like colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud
LINE 65: (Jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,
LINE 66: Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).
LINE 67: A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,
LINE 68: Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:
LINE 69: Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased
LINE 70: The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.
LINE 71: His buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,
LINE 72: That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;
LINE 73: Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,
LINE 74: And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd:
LINE 75: Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field,
LINE 76: And circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield:
LINE 77: Within its concave hung a silver thong,
LINE 78: On which a mimic serpent creeps along,
LINE 79: His azure length in easy waves extends,
LINE 80: Till in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.
LINE 81: Last o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,
LINE 82: With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
LINE 83: And in his hands two steely javelins wields,
LINE 84: That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.
LINE 85: That instant Juno, and the martial maid,
LINE 86: In happy thunders promised Greece their aid;
LINE 87: High o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,
LINE 88: And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.
LINE 89: Close to the limits of the trench and mound,
LINE 90: The fiery coursers to their chariots bound
LINE 91: The squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield
LINE 92: The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.
LINE 93: To second these, in close array combined,
LINE 94: The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.
LINE 95: Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,
LINE 96: As with the light the warriors' toils begun.
LINE 97: Even Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd
LINE 98: Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field;[220]
LINE 99: The woes of men unwilling to survey,
LINE 100: And all the slaughters that must stain the day.
LINE 101: Near Ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,
LINE 102: The Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground:
LINE 103: There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;
LINE 104: Æneas, honour'd as a guardian god;
LINE 105: Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;
LINE 106: The brother-warriors of Antenor's line:
LINE 107: With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face
LINE 108: And fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.
LINE 109: Great Hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,
LINE 110: Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.
LINE 111: As the red star now shows his sanguine fires
LINE 112: Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,
LINE 113: Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,
LINE 114: Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;
LINE 115: While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,
LINE 116: Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.
LINE 117: As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,
LINE 118: Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,
LINE 119: Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;
LINE 120: Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:
LINE 121: So Greece and Troy the field of war divide,
LINE 122: And falling ranks are strow'd on every side.
LINE 123: None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;[221]
LINE 124: But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,
LINE 125: Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;
LINE 126: Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.
LINE 127: Discord with joy the scene of death descries,
LINE 128: And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:
LINE 129: Discord alone, of all the immortal train,
LINE 130: Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:
LINE 131: The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,
LINE 132: Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:
LINE 133: But general murmurs told their griefs above,
LINE 134: And each accused the partial will of Jove.
LINE 135: Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,
LINE 136: The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,
LINE 137: Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;
LINE 138: And fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.
LINE 139: On earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,
LINE 140: And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise;
LINE 141: The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,
LINE 142: The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.
LINE 143: Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,
LINE 144: O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,
LINE 145: Commutual death the fate of war confounds,
LINE 146: Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
LINE 147: But now (what time in some sequester'd vale
LINE 148: The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,
LINE 149: When his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,
LINE 150: And claim a respite from the sylvan war;
LINE 151: But not till half the prostrate forests lay
LINE 152: Stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day)
LINE 153: Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might
LINE 154: Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.
LINE 155: Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led,
LINE 156: And slew Bienor at his people's head:
LINE 157: Whose squire Oïleus, with a sudden spring,
LINE 158: Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king;
LINE 159: But in his front he felt the fatal wound,
LINE 160: Which pierced his brain, and stretch'd him on the ground.
LINE 161: Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain:
LINE 162: Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:
LINE 163: Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky,
LINE 164: Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.
LINE 165: Two sons of Priam next to battle move,
LINE 166: The product, one of marriage, one of love:[222]
LINE 167: In the same car the brother-warriors ride;
LINE 168: This took the charge to combat, that to guide:
LINE 169: Far other task, than when they wont to keep,
LINE 170: On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.
LINE 171: These on the mountains once Achilles found,
LINE 172: And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;
LINE 173: Then to their sire for ample sums restored;
LINE 174: But now to perish by Atrides' sword:
LINE 175: Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:
LINE 176: Cleft through the head his brother's fate succeeds,
LINE 177: Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,
LINE 178: And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.
LINE 179: The Trojans see the youths untimely die,
LINE 180: But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.
LINE 181: So when a lion ranging o'er the lawns,
LINE 182: Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,
LINE 183: Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,
LINE 184: And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;
LINE 185: The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,
LINE 186: But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;
LINE 187: All drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies,
LINE 188: And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.
LINE 189: Amidst the tumult of the routed train,
LINE 190: The sons of false Antimachus were slain;
LINE 191: He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,
LINE 192: And voted Helen's stay for Paris' gold.
LINE 193: Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought,
LINE 194: And slew the children for the father's fault;
LINE 195: Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,
LINE 196: They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein;
LINE 197: Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,
LINE 198: And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:
LINE 199: "O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,
LINE 200: Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:
LINE 201: Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,
LINE 202: The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,
LINE 203: Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,
LINE 204: And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold."
LINE 205: These words, attended with the flood of tears,
LINE 206: The youths address'd to unrelenting ears:
LINE 207: The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:
LINE 208: "If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;
LINE 209: The daring wretch who once in council stood
LINE 210: To shed Ulysses' and my brother's blood,
LINE 211: For proffer'd peace! and sues his seed for grace?
LINE 212: No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race."
LINE 213: This said, Pisander from the car he cast,
LINE 214: And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.
LINE 215: His brother leap'd to earth; but, as he lay,
LINE 216: The trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;
LINE 217: His sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,
LINE 218: And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.
LINE 219: Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;
LINE 220: The king's example all his Greeks pursue.
LINE 221: Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,
LINE 222: Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.
LINE 223: From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,
LINE 224: Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.
LINE 225: The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,
LINE 226: And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,
LINE 227: Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;
LINE 228: The distanced army wonders at his deeds,
LINE 229: As when the winds with raging flames conspire,
LINE 230: And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,
LINE 231: In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,
LINE 232: And one refulgent ruin levels all:
LINE 233: Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe,
LINE 234: Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.
LINE 235: The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,
LINE 236: And many a car, now lighted of its lord,
LINE 237: Wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,
LINE 238: Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;
LINE 239: While his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives;
LINE 240: More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!
LINE 241: Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,
LINE 242: But Jove and destiny prolong'd his date.
LINE 243: Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,
LINE 244: Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.
LINE 245: Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,
LINE 246: Through the mid field the routed urge their way:
LINE 247: Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,
LINE 248: The path they take, and speed to reach the town.
LINE 249: As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,
LINE 250: Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.
LINE 251: Now near the beech-tree, and the Scæan gates,
LINE 252: The hero halts, and his associates waits.
LINE 253: Meanwhile on every side around the plain,
LINE 254: Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.
LINE 255: So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd
LINE 256: The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;
LINE 257: On heaps they tumble with successless haste;
LINE 258: The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.
LINE 259: Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,
LINE 260: Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;
LINE 261: Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,
LINE 262: And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.
LINE 263: Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;
LINE 264: Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.
LINE 265: But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,
LINE 266: And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:
LINE 267: The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,
LINE 268: And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:
LINE 269: "Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,
LINE 270: To godlike Hector this our word convey—
LINE 271: While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
LINE 272: Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
LINE 273: Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,
LINE 274: And trust the war to less important hands:
LINE 275: But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
LINE 276: That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
LINE 277: Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,
LINE 278: Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,
LINE 279: Till to the main the burning sun descend,
LINE 280: And sacred night her awful shade extend."
LINE 281: He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;
LINE 282: On wings of winds descends the various maid.
LINE 283: The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,
LINE 284: Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.
LINE 285: The goddess then: "O son of Priam, hear!
LINE 286: From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.
LINE 287: While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
LINE 288: Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
LINE 289: Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,
LINE 290: And trust the war to less important hands:
LINE 291: But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
LINE 292: The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
LINE 293: Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,
LINE 294: Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,
LINE 295: Till to the main the burning sun descend,
LINE 296: And sacred night her awful shade extend."
LINE 297: She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,
LINE 298: Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,
LINE 299: In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand
LINE 300: A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;
LINE 301: Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
LINE 302: And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
LINE 303: They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,
LINE 304: Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.
LINE 305: New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;
LINE 306: The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:
LINE 307: The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,
LINE 308: And learn from him to conquer, or to die.
LINE 309: Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,
LINE 310: Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?
LINE 311: The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,
LINE 312: From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;
LINE 313: Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,
LINE 314: And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.
LINE 315: Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,
LINE 316: And early honour warm his generous breast,
LINE 317: When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms
LINE 318: (Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.
LINE 319: But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,
LINE 320: He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;
LINE 321: From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,
LINE 322: And swift to aid his dearer country flies.
LINE 323: With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,
LINE 324: Thence took the long laborious march by land.
LINE 325: Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,
LINE 326: Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.
LINE 327: Atrides first discharged the missive spear;
LINE 328: The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.
LINE 329: Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,
LINE 330: With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:
LINE 331: But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,
LINE 332: The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.
LINE 333: Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,
LINE 334: Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;
LINE 335: At once his weighty sword discharged a wound
LINE 336: Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.
LINE 337: Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,
LINE 338: And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.
LINE 339: Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
LINE 340: Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!
LINE 341: No more the youth shall join his consort's side,
LINE 342: At once a virgin, and at once a bride!
LINE 343: No more with presents her embraces meet,
LINE 344: Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,
LINE 345: On whom his passion, lavish of his store,
LINE 346: Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!
LINE 347: Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,
LINE 348: While the proud victor bore his arms away.
LINE 349: Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:
LINE 350: Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,
LINE 351: While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,
LINE 352: And the pale features now deform'd with blood.
LINE 353: Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,
LINE 354: Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.
LINE 355: The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,
LINE 356: And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.
LINE 357: Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear
LINE 358: On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:
LINE 359: His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,
LINE 360: And calls his country to assert his cause;
LINE 361: Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,
LINE 362: And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.
LINE 363: Atrides, marking an unguarded part,
LINE 364: Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;
LINE 365: Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,
LINE 366: The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:
LINE 367: The social shades the same dark journey go,
LINE 368: And join each other in the realms below.
LINE 369: The vengeful victor rages round the fields,
LINE 370: With every weapon art or fury yields:
LINE 371: By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
LINE 372: Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.
LINE 373: This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;
LINE 374: But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,
LINE 375: Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,
LINE 376: Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:
LINE 377: (The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,
LINE 378: Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)
LINE 379: Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,
LINE 380: He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;
LINE 381: Then with a voice which fury made more strong,
LINE 382: And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:
LINE 383: "O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;
LINE 384: Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:
LINE 385: Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,
LINE 386: And envies half the glories of the day."
LINE 387: He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;
LINE 388: The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.
LINE 389: Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,
LINE 390: And from their sides the foam descends in snow;
LINE 391: Shot through the battle in a moment's space,
LINE 392: The wounded monarch at his tent they place.
LINE 393: No sooner Hector saw the king retired,
LINE 394: But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:
LINE 395: "Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!
LINE 396: Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:
LINE 397: Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,
LINE 398: Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.
LINE 399: Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!
LINE 400: Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!
LINE 401: Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;
LINE 402: And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds."
LINE 403: With words like these the fiery chief alarms
LINE 404: His fainting host, and every bosom warms.
LINE 405: As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear
LINE 406: The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:
LINE 407: With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,
LINE 408: And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:
LINE 409: So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;
LINE 410: Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.
LINE 411: On the black body of the foe he pours;
LINE 412: As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,
LINE 413: A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,
LINE 414: Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.
LINE 415: Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,
LINE 416: Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?
LINE 417: Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,
LINE 418: Opites next was added to their side;
LINE 419: Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,
LINE 420: Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;
LINE 421: Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;
LINE 422: The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.
LINE 423: As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,
LINE 424: Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:
LINE 425: The gust continued, violent and strong,
LINE 426: Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;
LINE 427: Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,
LINE 428: Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:
LINE 429: Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,
LINE 430: O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.
LINE 431: Now the last ruin the whole host appals;
LINE 432: Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;
LINE 433: But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,
LINE 434: His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.
LINE 435: "And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!
LINE 436: Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?
LINE 437: Haste, let us join, and combat side by side."
LINE 438: The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:
LINE 439: "No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;
LINE 440: Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.
LINE 441: But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:
LINE 442: And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."
LINE 443: He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,
LINE 444: And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:
LINE 445: Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,
LINE 446: His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.
LINE 447: There slain, they left them in eternal night,
LINE 448: Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.
LINE 449: So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,
LINE 450: Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.
LINE 451: Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain
LINE 452: Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.
LINE 453: The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;
LINE 454: Towering they rode in one refulgent car:
LINE 455: In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,
LINE 456: Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field.
LINE 457: Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;
LINE 458: They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;
LINE 459: Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;
LINE 460: The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.
LINE 461: Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,
LINE 462: And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.
LINE 463: Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,
LINE 464: And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.
LINE 465: By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,
LINE 466: The far-famed hero of Pæonian strain;
LINE 467: Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,
LINE 468: His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:
LINE 469: Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,
LINE 470: He fled, but flying left his life behind.
LINE 471: This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes
LINE 472: Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;
LINE 473: Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,
LINE 474: And moving armies on his march attend.
LINE 475: Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,
LINE 476: And thus bespoke his brother of the war:
LINE 477: "Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!
LINE 478: The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:
LINE 479: Here stand his utmost force."—The warrior said;
LINE 480: Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;
LINE 481: Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced
LINE 482: Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.
LINE 483: Safe in his helm (the gift of Phœbus' hands)
LINE 484: Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;
LINE 485: But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.
LINE 486: His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;
LINE 487: O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,
LINE 488: And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.
LINE 489: Tydides followed to regain his lance;
LINE 490: While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,
LINE 491: Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:
LINE 492: The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:
LINE 493: "Once more thank Phœbus for thy forfeit breath,
LINE 494: Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.
LINE 495: Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,
LINE 496: And oft that partial power has lent his aid.
LINE 497: Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,
LINE 498: If any god assist Tydides' hand.
LINE 499: Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,
LINE 500: Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,"
LINE 501: Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,
LINE 502: (The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)
LINE 503: Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,
LINE 504: From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:
LINE 505: Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,
LINE 506: And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;
LINE 507: Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest
LINE 508: To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,
LINE 509: The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,
LINE 510: But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.
LINE 511: The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.
LINE 512: Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.
LINE 513: "He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!
LINE 514: Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!
LINE 515: So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,
LINE 516: Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:
LINE 517: Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,
LINE 518: As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear."
LINE 519: He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,
LINE 520: Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;
LINE 521: Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,
LINE 522: Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!
LINE 523: Thou hast but done what boys or women can;
LINE 524: Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.
LINE 525: Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,
LINE 526: A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.
LINE 527: Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;
LINE 528: Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:
LINE 529: Where this but lights, some noble life expires;
LINE 530: Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,
LINE 531: Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,
LINE 532: And leaves such objects as distract the fair."
LINE 533: Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,
LINE 534: Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:
LINE 535: Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;
LINE 536: Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.
LINE 537: Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,
LINE 538: The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;
LINE 539: But stands collected in himself, and whole,
LINE 540: And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:
LINE 541: "What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?
LINE 542: What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?
LINE 543: What danger, singly if I stand the ground,
LINE 544: My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?
LINE 545: Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,
LINE 546: The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.
LINE 547: To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;
LINE 548: And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."
LINE 549: Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,
LINE 550: Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;
LINE 551: These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;
LINE 552: And round him deep the steely circle grows.
LINE 553: So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds
LINE 554: Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;
LINE 555: He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;
LINE 556: His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;
LINE 557: By these, by those, on every part is plied;
LINE 558: And the red slaughter spreads on every side.
LINE 559: Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;
LINE 560: Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;
LINE 561: Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,
LINE 562: Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
LINE 563: Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;
LINE 564: Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;
LINE 565: But to his aid his brother Socus flies,
LINE 566: Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.
LINE 567: Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:
LINE 568: "O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!
LINE 569: Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,
LINE 570: Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!
LINE 571: This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
LINE 572: And end at once the great Hippasian race,
LINE 573: Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."
LINE 574: He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:
LINE 575: Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,
LINE 576: Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.
LINE 577: By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,
LINE 578: Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.
LINE 579: The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,
LINE 580: Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):
LINE 581: "Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,
LINE 582: Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.
LINE 583: Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;
LINE 584: But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,
LINE 585: And add one spectre to the realms below!"
LINE 586: He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,
LINE 587: Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;
LINE 588: Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,
LINE 589: And held its passage through the panting heart:
LINE 590: Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;
LINE 591: He falls; his armour rings against the ground.
LINE 592: Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:
LINE 593: "Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;
LINE 594: There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,
LINE 595: Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.
LINE 596: Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;
LINE 597: Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;
LINE 598: But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,
LINE 599: And hovering vultures scream around their prey.
LINE 600: Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,
LINE 601: With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."
LINE 602: Then raging with intolerable smart,
LINE 603: He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.
LINE 604: The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,
LINE 605: And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.
LINE 606: Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,
LINE 607: Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.
LINE 608: Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;
LINE 609: The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:
LINE 610: Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,
LINE 611: Who shares his labours, and defends his side:
LINE 612: "O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;
LINE 613: Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;
LINE 614: Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,
LINE 615: Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.
LINE 616: Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,
LINE 617: And feel a loss not ages can repair."
LINE 618: Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;
LINE 619: Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,
LINE 620: The prudent chief in sore distress they found,
LINE 621: With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.[223]
LINE 622: As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,
LINE 623: From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;
LINE 624: Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,
LINE 625: He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,
LINE 626: Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,
LINE 627: Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:
LINE 628: Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,
LINE 629: The lion rushes through the woodland shade,
LINE 630: The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;
LINE 631: The lordly savage vindicates his prey.
LINE 632: Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,
LINE 633: A single warrior half a host sustains:
LINE 634: But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,
LINE 635: The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;
LINE 636: Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,
LINE 637: And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.
LINE 638: Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;
LINE 639: And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,
LINE 640: On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,
LINE 641: And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.
LINE 642: As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,
LINE 643: Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,
LINE 644: And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,
LINE 645: A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:
LINE 646: Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;
LINE 647: Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.
LINE 648: But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,
LINE 649: Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:
LINE 650: Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,
LINE 651: And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.
LINE 652: There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose
LINE 653: The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;
LINE 654: There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,
LINE 655: His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
LINE 656: The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,
LINE 657: Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:
LINE 658: In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,
LINE 659: And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.
LINE 660: To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:
LINE 661: "Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!
LINE 662: Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,
LINE 663: And great Machaon to the ships convey;
LINE 664: A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,
LINE 665: Is more than armies to the public weal."
LINE 666: Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode
LINE 667: The wounded offspring of the healing god.
LINE 668: He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet
LINE 669: Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.
LINE 670: But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,
LINE 671: Survey'd the various fortune of the war:
LINE 672: "While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,
LINE 673: Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.
LINE 674: Before great Ajax see the mingled throng
LINE 675: Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!
LINE 676: I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field
LINE 677: By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.
LINE 678: Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,
LINE 679: There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;
LINE 680: There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,
LINE 681: And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight."
LINE 682: Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;
LINE 683: Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;
LINE 684: Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,
LINE 685: O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
LINE 686: The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,
LINE 687: And, dashing, purple all the car before;
LINE 688: The groaning axle sable drops distils,
LINE 689: And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
LINE 690: Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,
LINE 691: Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:
LINE 692: (By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
LINE 693: The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)
LINE 694: Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,
LINE 695: And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.
LINE 696: But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,
LINE 697: Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;
LINE 698: Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,
LINE 699: Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.
LINE 700: O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,
LINE 701: And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.
LINE 702: Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,
LINE 703: Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;
LINE 704: Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,
LINE 705: Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,
LINE 706: Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;
LINE 707: Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:
LINE 708: So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,
LINE 709: While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.
LINE 710: As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,
LINE 711: In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,
LINE 712: Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,
LINE 713: Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;
LINE 714: Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,
LINE 715: The patient animal maintains his ground,
LINE 716: Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,
LINE 717: And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:
LINE 718: On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,
LINE 719: The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;
LINE 720: Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,
LINE 721: Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;
LINE 722: Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
LINE 723: And threats his followers with retorted eye.
LINE 724: Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,
LINE 725: While hissing darts descend in iron showers:
LINE 726: In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
LINE 727: Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;
LINE 728: And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
LINE 729: Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
LINE 730: But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,
LINE 731: And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;
LINE 732: Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,
LINE 733: Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;
LINE 734: From his torn liver the red current flow'd,
LINE 735: And his slack knees desert their dying load.
LINE 736: The victor rushing to despoil the dead,
LINE 737: From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;
LINE 738: Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,
LINE 739: Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.
LINE 740: Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,
LINE 741: Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:
LINE 742: "What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?
LINE 743: Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.
LINE 744: This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,
LINE 745: And this the last brave battle he shall wage:
LINE 746: Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave
LINE 747: The warrior rescue, and your country save."
LINE 748: Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,
LINE 749: Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,
LINE 750: To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand
LINE 751: With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:
LINE 752: Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;
LINE 753: The hero rallies, and renews the fight.
LINE 754: Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,
LINE 755: While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:
LINE 756: His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,
LINE 757: The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.
LINE 758: That hour Achilles, from the topmost height
LINE 759: Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;
LINE 760: His feasted eyes beheld around the plain
LINE 761: The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.
LINE 762: His friend Machaon singled from the rest,
LINE 763: A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.
LINE 764: Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:
LINE 765: Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;
LINE 766: In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,
LINE 767: And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.
LINE 768: "Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;
LINE 769: Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."
LINE 770: "O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)
LINE 771: Still at my heart, and ever at my side!
LINE 772: The time is come, when yon despairing host
LINE 773: Shall learn the value of the man they lost:
LINE 774: Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,
LINE 775: And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.
LINE 776: Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught
LINE 777: What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:
LINE 778: For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,
LINE 779: His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;
LINE 780: Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,
LINE 781: The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."
LINE 782: The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,
LINE 783: Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;
LINE 784: The chiefs descending from their car he found:
LINE 785: The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.
LINE 786: The warriors standing on the breezy shore,
LINE 787: To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,
LINE 788: Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale
LINE 789: Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;
LINE 790: Then to consult on farther methods went,
LINE 791: And took their seats beneath the shady tent.
LINE 792: The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,
LINE 793: Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:
LINE 794: (Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,
LINE 795: Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)
LINE 796: A table first with azure feet she placed;
LINE 797: Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;
LINE 798: Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,
LINE 799: And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,
LINE 800: Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,
LINE 801: A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings
LINE 802: From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,
LINE 803: Two feet support it, and four handles hold;
LINE 804: On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,
LINE 805: In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:
LINE 806: A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,
LINE 807: When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.
LINE 808: Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine
LINE 809: Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;
LINE 810: With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,
LINE 811: And last with flour the smiling surface strows:
LINE 812: This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:
LINE 813: The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:
LINE 814: Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,
LINE 815: And pleasing conference beguiles the day.
LINE 816: Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,
LINE 817: Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
LINE 818: Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led
LINE 819: To his high seat: the chief refused and said:
LINE 820: "'Tis now no season for these kind delays;
LINE 821: The great Achilles with impatience stays.
LINE 822: To great Achilles this respect I owe;
LINE 823: Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,
LINE 824: Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
LINE 825: With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.
LINE 826: This to report, my hasty course I bend;
LINE 827: Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend."
LINE 828: "Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)
LINE 829: Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?
LINE 830: Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?
LINE 831: This is not half the story of our woe.
LINE 832: Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,
LINE 833: Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,
LINE 834: Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,
LINE 835: And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.
LINE 836: But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!
LINE 837: Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:
LINE 838: Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,
LINE 839: And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.
LINE 840: Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;
LINE 841: Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.
LINE 842: Now the slow course of all-impairing time
LINE 843: Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;
LINE 844: Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,
LINE 845: When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,
LINE 846: The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,
LINE 847: And stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!
LINE 848: Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,
LINE 849: And ours was all the plunder of the plains:
LINE 850: Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,
LINE 851: As many goats, as many lowing kine:
LINE 852: And thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,
LINE 853: All teeming females, and of generous breeds.
LINE 854: These, as my first essay of arms, I won;
LINE 855: Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.
LINE 856: Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,
LINE 857: And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.
LINE 858: The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,
LINE 859: When the proud Elians first commenced the war:
LINE 860: For Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;
LINE 861: Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!
LINE 862: Oppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,
LINE 863: My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.
LINE 864: (That large reprisal he might justly claim,
LINE 865: For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,
LINE 866: When Elis' monarch, at the public course,
LINE 867: Detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)
LINE 868: The rest the people shared; myself survey'd
LINE 869: The just partition, and due victims paid.
LINE 870: Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,
LINE 871: With many a courser, and with many a car;
LINE 872: The sons of Actor at their army's head
LINE 873: (Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.
LINE 874: High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,
LINE 875: Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:
LINE 876: Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:
LINE 877: The stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.
LINE 878: Pallas, descending in the shades of night,
LINE 879: Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.
LINE 880: Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,
LINE 881: Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;
LINE 882: Fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;
LINE 883: And stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.
LINE 884: My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled
LINE 885: Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.
LINE 886: "Along fair Arene's delightful plain
LINE 887: Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:
LINE 888: There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,
LINE 889: And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.
LINE 890: Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,
LINE 891: To great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.
LINE 892: There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;
LINE 893: An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;
LINE 894: A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain
LINE 895: To the blue monarch of the watery main.
LINE 896: In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,
LINE 897: While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.
LINE 898: Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,
LINE 899: Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.
LINE 900: Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;
LINE 901: The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.
LINE 902: The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;
LINE 903: King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:
LINE 904: (She that all simples' healing virtues knew,
LINE 905: And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)
LINE 906: I seized his car, the van of battle led;
LINE 907: The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.
LINE 908: The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,
LINE 909: Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:
LINE 910: Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;
LINE 911: Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.
LINE 912: Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds
LINE 913: The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.
LINE 914: O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,
LINE 915: Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,
LINE 916: Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,
LINE 917: Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;
LINE 918: Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.
LINE 919: Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,
LINE 920: And the same arm that led concludes the day;
LINE 921: Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.
LINE 922: There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,
LINE 923: As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.
LINE 924: Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;
LINE 925: So proved my valour for my country's good.
LINE 926: "Achilles with unactive fury glows,
LINE 927: And gives to passion what to Greece he owes.
LINE 928: How shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade
LINE 929: Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!
LINE 930: O friend! my memory recalls the day,
LINE 931: When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,
LINE 932: I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,
LINE 933: And entered Peleus' hospitable court.
LINE 934: A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,
LINE 935: And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.
LINE 936: Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire
LINE 937: Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.
LINE 938: Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;
LINE 939: Social we sit, and share the genial rites.
LINE 940: We then explained the cause on which we came,
LINE 941: Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.
LINE 942: Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;
LINE 943: Peleus said only this:—'My son! be brave.'
LINE 944: Menoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine
LINE 945: In strength superior, and of race divine,
LINE 946: Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;
LINE 947: Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'
LINE 948: Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:
LINE 949: Words now forgot, though now of vast import.
LINE 950: Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:
LINE 951: Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;
LINE 952: Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;
LINE 953: Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.
LINE 954: If some dire oracle his breast alarm,
LINE 955: If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,
LINE 956: Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,
LINE 957: If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;
LINE 958: Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,
LINE 959: Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;
LINE 960: Press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train
LINE 961: Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again."
LINE 962: This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent
LINE 963: Along the shore with hasty strides he went;
LINE 964: Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,
LINE 965: The public mart and courts of justice stand,
LINE 966: Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,
LINE 967: And altars to the guardian gods arise;
LINE 968: There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,
LINE 969: Large painful drops from all his members run;
LINE 970: An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,
LINE 971: The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.
LINE 972: As faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,
LINE 973: Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.
LINE 974: Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,
LINE 975: Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:
LINE 976: "Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!
LINE 977: Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?
LINE 978: Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,
LINE 979: Far from your friends, and from your native shore?
LINE 980: Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?
LINE 981: Resists she yet the raging Hector's hand?
LINE 982: Or are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,
LINE 983: And this the period of our wars and fame?"
LINE 984: Eurypylus replies: "No more, my friend;
LINE 985: Greece is no more! this day her glories end;
LINE 986: Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,
LINE 987: Her force increasing as her toil renews.
LINE 988: Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,
LINE 989: Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.
LINE 990: But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,
LINE 991: Lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;
LINE 992: With lukewarm water wash the gore away;
LINE 993: With healing balms the raging smart allay,
LINE 994: Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,
LINE 995: Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.
LINE 996: Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands
LINE 997: This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;
LINE 998: And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,
LINE 999: Now wants that succour which so oft he lent."
LINE 1000: To him the chief: "What then remains to do?
LINE 1001: The event of things the gods alone can view.
LINE 1002: Charged by Achilles' great command I fly,
LINE 1003: And bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:
LINE 1004: But thy distress this instant claims relief."
LINE 1005: He said, and in his arms upheld the chief.
LINE 1006: The slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,
LINE 1007: And hides of oxen on the floor display'd:
LINE 1008: There stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay;
LINE 1009: Patroclus cut the forky steel away:
LINE 1010: Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;
LINE 1011: The wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.
LINE 1012: The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,
LINE 1013: The wound to torture, and the blood to flow.
