LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.
LINE 3: The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree
LINE 4: upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break
LINE 5: the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is
LINE 6: wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan
LINE 7: troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts
LINE 8: of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some
LINE 9: by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for
LINE 10: his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain
LINE 11: on both sides.
LINE 12: The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it
LINE 13: does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the
LINE 14: seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.
LINE 15: And now Olympus' shining gates unfold;
LINE 16: The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:
LINE 17: Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,
LINE 18: The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:
LINE 19: While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ
LINE 20: Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.
LINE 21: When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen,
LINE 22: Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,
LINE 23: "Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,
LINE 24: Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;[125]
LINE 25: But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,
LINE 26: The tame spectators of his deeds of war.
LINE 27: Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,
LINE 28: The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,
LINE 29: Each danger wards, and constant in her care,
LINE 30: Saves in the moment of the last despair.
LINE 31: Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,
LINE 32: Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.
LINE 33: Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits
LINE 34: To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!
LINE 35: Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,
LINE 36: Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?
LINE 37: Yet, would the gods for human good provide,
LINE 38: Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,
LINE 39: Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,
LINE 40: And through his gates the crowding nations flow."
LINE 41: Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,
LINE 42: And queen of war, in close consult engaged:
LINE 43: Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,
LINE 44: And meditate the future woes of Troy.
LINE 45: Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,
LINE 46: The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;
LINE 47: But Juno, impotent of passion, broke
LINE 48: Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:
LINE 49: [Illustration: ] THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS
LINE 50: "Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!
LINE 51: My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?
LINE 52: Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,
LINE 53: Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?
LINE 54: To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;
LINE 55: The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.
LINE 56: At length ripe vengeance o'er their heads impends,
LINE 57: But Jove himself the faithless race defends.
LINE 58: Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust,
LINE 59: Not all the gods are partial and unjust."
LINE 60: The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,
LINE 61: Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies:
LINE 62: "Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate
LINE 63: To Phrygia's monarch, and the Phrygian state!
LINE 64: What high offence has fired the wife of Jove?
LINE 65: Can wretched mortals harm the powers above,
LINE 66: That Troy, and Troy's whole race thou wouldst confound,
LINE 67: And yon fair structures level with the ground!
LINE 68: Haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,
LINE 69: Burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!
LINE 70: Let Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,
LINE 71: Bleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore:
LINE 72: To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,
LINE 73: Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!
LINE 74: So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,[126]
LINE 75: When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.
LINE 76: But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate
LINE 77: On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;
LINE 78: Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,
LINE 79: Remember Troy, and give the vengeance way.
LINE 80: For know, of all the numerous towns that rise
LINE 81: Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,
LINE 82: Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,
LINE 83: None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.
LINE 84: No mortals merit more distinguish'd grace
LINE 85: Than godlike Priam, or than Priam's race.
LINE 86: Still to our name their hecatombs expire,
LINE 87: And altars blaze with unextinguish'd fire."
LINE 88: At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,
LINE 89: Then on the Thunderer fix'd them, and replies:
LINE 90: "Three towns are Juno's on the Grecian plains,
LINE 91: More dear than all the extended earth contains,
LINE 92: Mycenæ, Argos, and the Spartan wall;[127]
LINE 93: These thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall:
LINE 94: 'Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;
LINE 95: The crime's sufficient that they share my love.
LINE 96: Of power superior why should I complain?
LINE 97: Resent I may, but must resent in vain.
LINE 98: Yet some distinction Juno might require,
LINE 99: Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire,
LINE 100: A goddess born, to share the realms above,
LINE 101: And styled the consort of the thundering Jove;
LINE 102: Nor thou a wife and sister's right deny;[128]
LINE 103: Let both consent, and both by terms comply;
LINE 104: So shall the gods our joint decrees obey,
LINE 105: And heaven shall act as we direct the way.
LINE 106: See ready Pallas waits thy high commands
LINE 107: To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;
LINE 108: Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,
LINE 109: And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace."
LINE 110: The sire of men and monarch of the sky
LINE 111: The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,
LINE 112: Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ
LINE 113: To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.
LINE 114: Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,
LINE 115: And shot like lightning from Olympus' height.
LINE 116: As the red comet, from Saturnius sent
LINE 117: To fright the nations with a dire portent,
LINE 118: (A fatal sign to armies on the plain,
LINE 119: Or trembling sailors on the wintry main,)
LINE 120: With sweeping glories glides along in air,
LINE 121: And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:[129]
LINE 122: Between both armies thus, in open sight
LINE 123: Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,
LINE 124: With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire
LINE 125: The power descending, and the heavens on fire!
LINE 126: "The gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,
LINE 127: And fate now labours with some vast event:
LINE 128: Jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares;
LINE 129: Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars."
LINE 130: They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,
LINE 131: (In shape a mortal,) pass'd disguised along.
LINE 132: Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,
LINE 133: Who from Antenor traced his high descent.
LINE 134: Amidst the ranks Lycaon's son she found,
LINE 135: The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown'd;
LINE 136: Whose squadrons, led from black Æsepus' flood,[130]
LINE 137: With flaming shields in martial circle stood.
LINE 138: To him the goddess: "Phrygian! canst thou hear
LINE 139: A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?
LINE 140: What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,
LINE 141: Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan's heart?
LINE 142: What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,
LINE 143: Thy country's foe, the Grecian glory slain?
LINE 144: Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,
LINE 145: Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!
LINE 146: But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow
LINE 147: To Lycian Phœbus with the silver bow,
LINE 148: And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,
LINE 149: On Zelia's altars, to the god of day."[131]
LINE 150: He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,
LINE 151: His polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.
LINE 152: 'Twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil:
LINE 153: A mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.
LINE 154: Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;
LINE 155: The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,
LINE 156: And sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread:
LINE 157: The workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,
LINE 158: And beaten gold each taper point adorns.
LINE 159: This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,
LINE 160: Screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends:
LINE 161: There meditates the mark; and couching low,
LINE 162: Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.
LINE 163: One from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,
LINE 164: Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;
LINE 165: Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown
LINE 166: Apollo's altars in his native town.
LINE 167: Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,
LINE 168: Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;
LINE 169: Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,
LINE 170: Till the barb'd points approach the circling bow;
LINE 171: The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;
LINE 172: Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.
LINE 173: But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour
LINE 174: The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,
LINE 175: Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)
LINE 176: Diverts the weapon from its destined course:
LINE 177: So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,
LINE 178: The watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.
LINE 179: Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,
LINE 180: Where linen folds the double corslet lined,
LINE 181: She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,
LINE 182: Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;
LINE 183: The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,
LINE 184: And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.
LINE 185: As when some stately trappings are decreed
LINE 186: To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,
LINE 187: A nymph in Caria or Mæonia bred,
LINE 188: Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;
LINE 189: With equal lustre various colours vie,
LINE 190: The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:
LINE 191: So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,
LINE 192: As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.
LINE 193: With horror seized, the king of men descried
LINE 194: The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:
LINE 195: Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found
LINE 196: The shining barb appear above the wound,
LINE 197: Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,
LINE 198: The royal brother thus his grief express'd,
LINE 199: And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around
LINE 200: With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.
LINE 201: "Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree
LINE 202: The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!
LINE 203: Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,
LINE 204: To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!
LINE 205: The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,
LINE 206: And faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.
LINE 207: Not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,
LINE 208: Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,
LINE 209: Shall all be vain: when Heaven's revenge is slow,
LINE 210: Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.
LINE 211: The day shall come, that great avenging day,
LINE 212: When Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,
LINE 213: When Priam's powers and Priam's self shall fall,
LINE 214: And one prodigious ruin swallow all.
LINE 215: I see the god, already, from the pole
LINE 216: Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;
LINE 217: I see the Eternal all his fury shed,
LINE 218: And shake his ægis o'er their guilty head.
LINE 219: Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;
LINE 220: But thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.
LINE 221: Still must I mourn the period of thy days,
LINE 222: And only mourn, without my share of praise?
LINE 223: Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more
LINE 224: Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;
LINE 225: Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,
LINE 226: Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;
LINE 227: While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,
LINE 228: (And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)
LINE 229: 'Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,
LINE 230: And such the conquest of her king of kings!
LINE 231: Lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,
LINE 232: And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'
LINE 233: Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
LINE 234: O'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame."
LINE 235: He said: a leader's and a brother's fears
LINE 236: Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:
LINE 237: "Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;
LINE 238: The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:
LINE 239: Stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,
LINE 240: My varied belt repell'd the flying wound."
LINE 241: To whom the king: "My brother and my friend,
LINE 242: Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!
LINE 243: Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art
LINE 244: May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.
LINE 245: Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring
LINE 246: His speedy succour to the Spartan king;
LINE 247: Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),
LINE 248: The Grecian's sorrow, and the Dardan's joy."
LINE 249: With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;
LINE 250: Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,
LINE 251: And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands[132]
LINE 252: In arms incircled with his native bands.
LINE 253: Then thus: "Machaon, to the king repair,
LINE 254: His wounded brother claims thy timely care;
LINE 255: Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,
LINE 256: A grief to us, a triumph to the foe."
LINE 257: The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:
LINE 258: Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.
LINE 259: The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,
LINE 260: And all the chiefs in deep concern around.
LINE 261: Where to the steely point the reed was join'd,
LINE 262: The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.
LINE 263: Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,
LINE 264: He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;
LINE 265: Then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,[133]
LINE 266: Which Chiron gave, and Æsculapius used.
LINE 267: While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,
LINE 268: The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;
LINE 269: Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,
LINE 270: Once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.
LINE 271: Nor had you seen the king of men appear
LINE 272: Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;
LINE 273: But fond of glory, with severe delight,
LINE 274: His beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.
LINE 275: No longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,
LINE 276: Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid
LINE 277: But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;
LINE 278: The fiery coursers snorted at his side.
LINE 279: On foot through all the martial ranks he moves
LINE 280: And these encourages, and those reproves.
LINE 281: "Brave men!" he cries, (to such who boldly dare
LINE 282: Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),
LINE 283: "Your ancient valour on the foes approve;
LINE 284: Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.
LINE 285: 'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,
LINE 286: Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;
LINE 287: Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,
LINE 288: And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains."
LINE 289: Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;
LINE 290: Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:
LINE 291: "Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;
LINE 292: Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!
LINE 293: Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,
LINE 294: Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?
LINE 295: Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer
LINE 296: Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.
LINE 297: Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,
LINE 298: Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?
LINE 299: Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,
LINE 300: To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?"
LINE 301: This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,
LINE 302: To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;
LINE 303: High at their head he saw the chief appear,
LINE 304: And bold Meriones excite the rear.
LINE 305: At this the king his generous joy express'd,
LINE 306: And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.
LINE 307: "Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe
LINE 308: To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?
LINE 309: To thee the foremost honours are decreed,
LINE 310: First in the fight and every graceful deed.
LINE 311: For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls
LINE 312: Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,
LINE 313: Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,
LINE 314: Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.
LINE 315: Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;
LINE 316: Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame."
LINE 317: To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:
LINE 318: "Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.
LINE 319: Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,
LINE 320: Thy firm associate in the day of war.
LINE 321: But let the signal be this moment given;
LINE 322: To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.
LINE 323: The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,
LINE 324: And chains or death avenge the impious deed."
LINE 325: Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,
LINE 326: And next the troops of either Ajax views:
LINE 327: In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,
LINE 328: A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.
LINE 329: Thus from the lofty promontory's brow
LINE 330: A swain surveys the gathering storm below;
LINE 331: Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,
LINE 332: Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,
LINE 333: Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,
LINE 334: The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:
LINE 335: He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock
LINE 336: To the close covert of an arching rock.
LINE 337: Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,
LINE 338: With spears erect, a moving iron wood:
LINE 339: A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,
LINE 340: And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.
LINE 341: "O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,
LINE 342: Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,
LINE 343: (Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands
LINE 344: With great examples, more than loud commands.
LINE 345: Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest
LINE 346: Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,
LINE 347: Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,
LINE 348: And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground."
LINE 349: Then to the next the general bends his course;
LINE 350: (His heart exults, and glories in his force);
LINE 351: There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,
LINE 352: And with inspiring eloquence commands;
LINE 353: With strictest order sets his train in arms,
LINE 354: The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.
LINE 355: Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,
LINE 356: Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.
LINE 357: The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,
LINE 358: The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;
LINE 359: The middle space suspected troops supply,
LINE 360: Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;
LINE 361: He gives command to "curb the fiery steed,
LINE 362: Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:
LINE 363: Before the rest let none too rashly ride;
LINE 364: No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:
LINE 365: The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,
LINE 366: But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.
LINE 367: He whom the fortune of the field shall cast
LINE 368: From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;
LINE 369: Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,
LINE 370: Content with javelins to provoke the war.
LINE 371: Our great forefathers held this prudent course,
LINE 372: Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;
LINE 373: By laws like these immortal conquests made,
LINE 374: And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid."
LINE 375: So spoke the master of the martial art,
LINE 376: And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.
LINE 377: "Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,
LINE 378: And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!
LINE 379: But wasting years, that wither human race,
LINE 380: Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.
LINE 381: What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!
LINE 382: And age the lot of any chief but thee."
LINE 383: Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;
LINE 384: He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:
LINE 385: "Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew[134]
LINE 386: That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;
LINE 387: Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain
LINE 388: Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.
LINE 389: But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,
LINE 390: These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:
LINE 391: The field of combat fits the young and bold,
LINE 392: The solemn council best becomes the old:
LINE 393: To you the glorious conflict I resign,
LINE 394: Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."
LINE 395: He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,
LINE 396: And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,
LINE 397: With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;
LINE 398: And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.
LINE 399: Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far
LINE 400: The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;
LINE 401: The tumult late begun, they stood intent
LINE 402: To watch the motion, dubious of the event.
LINE 403: The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,
LINE 404: With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:
LINE 405: "Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.
LINE 406: And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?
LINE 407: Why stand you distant, and the rest expect
LINE 408: To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?
LINE 409: From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare
LINE 410: The shock of armies, and commence the war;
LINE 411: For this your names are call'd before the rest,
LINE 412: To share the pleasures of the genial feast:
LINE 413: And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey
LINE 414: Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?
LINE 415: Say, is it thus those honours you requite?
LINE 416: The first in banquets, but the last in fight."
LINE 417: Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread
LINE 418: His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:
LINE 419: "Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand
LINE 420: Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.
LINE 421: If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,
LINE 422: Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.
LINE 423: Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,
LINE 424: Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."
LINE 425: Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:
LINE 426: "O great in action, and in council wise!
LINE 427: With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,
LINE 428: Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.
LINE 429: Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,
LINE 430: Forgive the transport of a martial mind.
LINE 431: Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;
LINE 432: The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends."
LINE 433: He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,
LINE 434: His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;
LINE 435: (The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)[135]
LINE 436: To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:
LINE 437: "O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame
LINE 438: The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)
LINE 439: Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,
LINE 440: With hands unactive, and a careless eye?
LINE 441: Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;
LINE 442: Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:
LINE 443: What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,
LINE 444: Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?
LINE 445: I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,
LINE 446: A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenæ's towers;
LINE 447: Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,
LINE 448: Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;
LINE 449: While dreadful comets glaring from afar,
LINE 450: Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.[136]
LINE 451: Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,
LINE 452: A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;
LINE 453: Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,
LINE 454: Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.
LINE 455: The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,
LINE 456: And dared to combat all those chiefs around:
LINE 457: Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;
LINE 458: For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.
LINE 459: Stung with the shame, within the winding way,
LINE 460: To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;
LINE 461: Two heroes led the secret squadron on,
LINE 462: Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;
LINE 463: Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.
LINE 464: He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,
LINE 465: Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;
LINE 466: Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!"
LINE 467: No words the godlike Diomed return'd,
LINE 468: But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:
LINE 469: Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;
LINE 470: Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:
LINE 471: "What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,
LINE 472: Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?
LINE 473: Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess
LINE 474: Our value equal, though our fury less.
LINE 475: With fewer troops we storm'd the Theban wall,
LINE 476: And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,[137]
LINE 477: In impious acts the guilty father died;
LINE 478: The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.
LINE 479: Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,
LINE 480: Our glories darken their diminish'd name."
LINE 481: To him Tydides thus: "My friend, forbear;
LINE 482: Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:
LINE 483: His high concern may well excuse this rage,
LINE 484: Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:
LINE 485: His the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown,
LINE 486: And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.
LINE 487: Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,
LINE 488: 'Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight."
LINE 489: He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground
LINE 490: Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.
LINE 491: Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,
LINE 492: Of arm'd Tydides rushing to the war.
LINE 493: As when the winds, ascending by degrees,[138]
LINE 494: First move the whitening surface of the seas,
LINE 495: The billows float in order to the shore,
LINE 496: The wave behind rolls on the wave before;
LINE 497: Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,
LINE 498: Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.
LINE 499: So to the fight the thick battalions throng,
LINE 500: Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along
LINE 501: Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;
LINE 502: No sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands,
LINE 503: Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,
LINE 504: As if some god had snatch'd their voice away.
LINE 505: Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends
LINE 506: A general shout that all the region rends.
LINE 507: As when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand
LINE 508: In wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand,
LINE 509: The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,
LINE 510: The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:
LINE 511: Such clamours rose from various nations round,
LINE 512: Mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.
LINE 513: Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,
LINE 514: These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,
LINE 515: Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;
LINE 516: And discord raging bathes the purple plain;
LINE 517: Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,
LINE 518: Small at her birth, but rising every hour,
LINE 519: While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,
LINE 520: She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;[139]
LINE 521: The nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,
LINE 522: The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.
LINE 523: Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,
LINE 524: To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,
LINE 525: Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,
LINE 526: The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,
LINE 527: Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,
LINE 528: And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;
LINE 529: With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
LINE 530: And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
LINE 531: As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,
LINE 532: With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills
LINE 533: Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain,
LINE 534: Roar through a thousand channels to the main:
LINE 535: The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;
LINE 536: So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.
LINE 537: The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,
LINE 538: The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:
LINE 539: At great Echepolus the lance arrives,
LINE 540: Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;
LINE 541: Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,
LINE 542: And shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.
LINE 543: So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood
LINE 544: Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.
LINE 545: Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,[140]
LINE 546: Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:
LINE 547: But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,
LINE 548: Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.
LINE 549: His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,
LINE 550: Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;
LINE 551: The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;
LINE 552: The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.
LINE 553: Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;
LINE 554: The war renews, the warriors bleed again:
LINE 555: As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,
LINE 556: Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.
LINE 557: In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,
LINE 558: Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;
LINE 559: Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore
LINE 560: Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:
LINE 561: The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,
LINE 562: To seek her parents on his flowery side,
LINE 563: Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,
LINE 564: And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.
LINE 565: Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,
LINE 566: He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!
LINE 567: So falls a poplar, that in watery ground
LINE 568: Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,
LINE 569: (Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,
LINE 570: To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)
LINE 571: Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,
LINE 572: With all its beauteous honours on its head
LINE 573: There, left a subject to the wind and rain,
LINE 574: And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain
LINE 575: Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies
LINE 576: Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.
LINE 577: At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;
LINE 578: The pointed lance with erring fury flew,
LINE 579: And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.
LINE 580: He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,
LINE 581: And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.
LINE 582: This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,
LINE 583: Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;
LINE 584: Arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,
LINE 585: In act to throw; but cautious look'd around,
LINE 586: Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,
LINE 587: And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.
LINE 588: A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,
LINE 589: Old Priam's son, Democoon was his name.
LINE 590: The weapon entered close above his ear,
LINE 591: Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;[141]
LINE 592: With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,
LINE 593: His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;
LINE 594: Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,
LINE 595: And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
LINE 596: Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;
LINE 597: E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;
LINE 598: Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;
LINE 599: The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:
LINE 600: But Phœbus now from Ilion's towering height
LINE 601: Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.
LINE 602: "Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;
LINE 603: Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!
LINE 604: Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel;
LINE 605: Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.
LINE 606: Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?
LINE 607: The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more."
LINE 608: Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers,
LINE 609: Array'd in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:
LINE 610: While war's fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,
LINE 611: And shouts and thunders in the fields below.
LINE 612: Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,
LINE 613: In vain his valour and illustrious line.
LINE 614: A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,
LINE 615: (Who from cold Ænus led the Thracian crew,)[142]
LINE 616: Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,
LINE 617: Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.
LINE 618: Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,
LINE 619: Before his helpless friends, and native bands,
LINE 620: And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.
LINE 621: The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,
LINE 622: And through his navel drove the pointed death:
LINE 623: His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,
LINE 624: And the warm life came issuing from the wound.
LINE 625: His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,
LINE 626: Deep in his breast above the pap it went,
LINE 627: Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,
LINE 628: And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:
LINE 629: Till from the dying chief, approaching near,
LINE 630: The Ætolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:
LINE 631: Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,
LINE 632: And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;
LINE 633: The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,
LINE 634: To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;
LINE 635: The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,
LINE 636: A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.
LINE 637: Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,
LINE 638: In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.
LINE 639: Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,
LINE 640: And one the leader of the Epeian race;
LINE 641: Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,
LINE 642: In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.
LINE 643: With copious slaughter all the fields are red,
LINE 644: And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.
LINE 645: Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,
LINE 646: By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;
LINE 647: Might darts be bid to turn their points away,
LINE 648: And swords around him innocently play;
LINE 649: The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,
LINE 650: And counted heroes where he counted men.
LINE 651: So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,
LINE 652: And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.
