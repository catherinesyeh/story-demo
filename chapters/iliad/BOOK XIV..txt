LINE 1: ARGUMENT.[231]
LINE 2: JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.
LINE 3: Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the
LINE 4: increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he
LINE 5: meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the
LINE 6: extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by
LINE 7: night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,
LINE 8: wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with
LINE 9: their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of
LINE 10: Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off
LINE 11: her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)
LINE 12: obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god
LINE 13: of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of
LINE 14: Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first
LINE 15: sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid
LINE 16: asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the
LINE 17: Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,
LINE 18: and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the
LINE 19: Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax
LINE 20: signalizes himself in a particular manner.
LINE 21: But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,
LINE 22: Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;
LINE 23: His startled ears the increasing cries attend;
LINE 24: Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:
LINE 25: "What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,
LINE 26: What mix'd events attend this mighty day?
LINE 27: Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,
LINE 28: And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!
LINE 29: Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,
LINE 30: Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,
LINE 31: Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;
LINE 32: While I the adventures of the day explore."
LINE 33: He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,
LINE 34: (His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;
LINE 35: (That day the son his father's buckler bore;)
LINE 36: Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.
LINE 37: Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,
LINE 38: His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;
LINE 39: Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,
LINE 40: The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.
LINE 41: As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,
LINE 42: The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:
LINE 43: While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,
LINE 44: Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,
LINE 45: The mass of waters will no wind obey;
LINE 46: Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.
LINE 47: While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,
LINE 48: Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,
LINE 49: To join the host, or to the general haste;
LINE 50: Debating long, he fixes on the last:
LINE 51: Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,
LINE 52: The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,
LINE 53: The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;
LINE 54: Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.
LINE 55: Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,
LINE 56: By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:
LINE 57: The king of men, Ulysses the divine,
LINE 58: And who to Tydeus owes his noble line[232]
LINE 59: (Their ships at distance from the battle stand,
LINE 60: In lines advanced along the shelving strand:
LINE 61: Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain
LINE 62: At length; beside the margin of the main,
LINE 63: Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:
LINE 64: Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)
LINE 65: Supported on the spears, they took their way,
LINE 66: Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.
LINE 67: Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,
LINE 68: Whom thus the general of the host address'd:
LINE 69: "O grace and glory of the Achaian name;
LINE 70: What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?
LINE 71: Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,
LINE 72: Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?
LINE 73: Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,
LINE 74: On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.
LINE 75: Is every heart inflamed with equal rage
LINE 76: Against your king, nor will one chief engage?
LINE 77: And have I lived to see with mournful eyes
LINE 78: In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"
LINE 79: Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;
LINE 80: And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.
LINE 81: Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,
LINE 82: Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.
LINE 83: The wall, our late inviolable bound,
LINE 84: And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:
LINE 85: Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,
LINE 86: And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.
LINE 87: On speedy measures then employ your thought
LINE 88: In such distress! if counsel profit aught:
LINE 89: Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,
LINE 90: These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight."
LINE 91: To him the monarch: "That our army bends,
LINE 92: That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,
LINE 93: And that the rampart, late our surest trust
LINE 94: And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;
LINE 95: All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,
LINE 96: Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.
LINE 97: Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,
LINE 98: And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;
LINE 99: Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,
LINE 100: And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.
LINE 101: Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,
LINE 102: And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;
LINE 103: Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:
LINE 104: Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,
LINE 105: Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.
LINE 106: Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,
LINE 107: Than perish in the danger we may shun."
LINE 108: Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,
LINE 109: While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:
LINE 110: "What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)
LINE 111: Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?
LINE 112: Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,
LINE 113: And thou the shame of any host but ours!
LINE 114: A host, by Jove endued with martial might,
LINE 115: And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:
LINE 116: Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,
LINE 117: Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.
LINE 118: And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?
LINE 119: And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?
LINE 120: In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,
LINE 121: Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.
LINE 122: Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares
LINE 123: To think such meanness, or the thought declares?
LINE 124: And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway
LINE 125: The banded legions of all Greece obey?
LINE 126: Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,
LINE 127: While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?
LINE 128: What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies
LINE 129: Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.
LINE 130: No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,
LINE 131: Themselves abandon'd) shall the fight pursue;
LINE 132: But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;
LINE 133: And owe destruction to a prince like thee."
LINE 134: "Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)
LINE 135: Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.
LINE 136: Unwilling as I am to lose the host,
LINE 137: I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;
LINE 138: Glad I submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,
LINE 139: Aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold."
LINE 140: Tydides cut him short, and thus began:
LINE 141: "Such counsel if you seek, behold the man
LINE 142: Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,
LINE 143: Young though he be, disdain not to obey:
LINE 144: A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,
LINE 145: May speak to councils and assembled kings.
LINE 146: Hear then in me the great OEnides' son,
LINE 147: Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)
LINE 148: Lies whelm'd in ruins of the Theban wall;
LINE 149: Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.
LINE 150: With three bold sons was generous Prothous bless'd,
LINE 151: Who Pleuron's walls and Calydon possess'd;
LINE 152: Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass'd
LINE 153: The rest in courage) Å’neus was the last.
LINE 154: From him, my sire. From Calydon expell'd,
LINE 155: He pass'd to Argos, and in exile dwell'd;
LINE 156: The monarch's daughter there (so Jove ordain'd)
LINE 157: He won, and flourish'd where Adrastus reign'd;
LINE 158: There, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,
LINE 159: Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,
LINE 160: And numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.
LINE 161: Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!
LINE 162: Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.
LINE 163: Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,
LINE 164: Attend, and in the son respect the sire.
LINE 165: Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,
LINE 166: Let each go forth, and animate the rest,
LINE 167: Advance the glory which he cannot share,
LINE 168: Though not partaker, witness of the war.
LINE 169: But lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,
LINE 170: Beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,
LINE 171: Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,
LINE 172: Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war."
LINE 173: He added not: the listening kings obey,
LINE 174: Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.
LINE 175: The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)
LINE 176: Appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age;
LINE 177: Press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,
LINE 178: And thus the venerable hero spoke:
LINE 179: "Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye
LINE 180: Achilles sees his country's forces fly;
LINE 181: Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,
LINE 182: Who glories in unutterable pride.
LINE 183: So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim
LINE 184: The wretch relentless, and o'erwhelm with shame!
LINE 185: But Heaven forsakes not thee: o'er yonder sands
LINE 186: Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands
LINE 187: Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd,
LINE 188: Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around
LINE 189: Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ
LINE 190: To hide their ignominious heads in Troy."
LINE 191: He spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,
LINE 192: And sent his voice before him as he flew,
LINE 193: Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield
LINE 194: When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;
LINE 195: Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound
LINE 196: Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.
LINE 197: Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,
LINE 198: And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.
LINE 199: Meantime Saturnia from Olympus' brow,
LINE 200: High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;
LINE 201: With joy the glorious conflict she survey'd,
LINE 202: Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.
LINE 203: But placed aloft, on Ida's shady height
LINE 204: She sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.
LINE 205: Jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,
LINE 206: What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?
LINE 207: At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove
LINE 208: The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;
LINE 209: Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,
LINE 210: And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.
LINE 211: Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,
LINE 212: Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares:
LINE 213: With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,
LINE 214: Safe from access of each intruding power.
LINE 215: Touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold:
LINE 216: Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.
LINE 217: Here first she bathes; and round her body pours
LINE 218: Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:
LINE 219: The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey
LINE 220: Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:
LINE 221: Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets
LINE 222: The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.
LINE 223: Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride
LINE 224: Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;
LINE 225: Part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,
LINE 226: Part o'er her shoulders waved like melted gold.
LINE 227: Around her next a heavenly mantle flow'd,
LINE 228: That rich with Pallas' labour'd colours glow'd:
LINE 229: Large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd round,
LINE 230: A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.
LINE 231: Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,
LINE 232: Each gem illumined with a triple star.
LINE 233: Then o'er her head she cast a veil more white
LINE 234: Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.
LINE 235: Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.
LINE 236: Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,
LINE 237: Forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,
LINE 238: And calls the mother of the smiles and loves.
LINE 239: "How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)
LINE 240: Shall human strife celestial minds divide?
LINE 241: Ah yet, will Venus aid Saturnia's joy,
LINE 242: And set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?"
LINE 243: "Let heaven's dread empress (Cytheraea said)
LINE 244: Speak her request, and deem her will obey'd."
LINE 245: "Then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,
LINE 246: That power, which mortals and immortals warms,
LINE 247: That love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,
LINE 248: And burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!
LINE 249: "For lo! I haste to those remote abodes,
LINE 250: Where the great parents, (sacred source of gods!)
LINE 251: Ocean and Tethys their old empire keep,
LINE 252: On the last limits of the land and deep.
LINE 253: In their kind arms my tender years were past;
LINE 254: What time old Saturn, from Olympus cast,
LINE 255: Of upper heaven to Jove resign'd the reign,
LINE 256: Whelm'd under the huge mass of earth and main.
LINE 257: For strife, I hear, has made the union cease,
LINE 258: Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
LINE 259: What honour, and what love, shall I obtain,
LINE 260: If I compose those fatal feuds again;
LINE 261: Once more their minds in mutual ties engage,
LINE 262: And, what my youth has owed, repay their age!"
LINE 263: She said. With awe divine, the queen of love
LINE 264: Obey'd the sister and the wife of Jove;
LINE 265: And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,[233]
LINE 266: With various skill and high embroidery graced.
LINE 267: In this was every art, and every charm,
LINE 268: To win the wisest, and the coldest warm:
LINE 269: Fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,
LINE 270: The kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,
LINE 271: Persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,
LINE 272: Silence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.
LINE 273: This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:
LINE 274: "Take this, and with it all thy wish;" she said.
LINE 275: With smiles she took the charm; and smiling press'd
LINE 276: The powerful cestus to her snowy breast.
LINE 277: Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;
LINE 278: Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.
LINE 279: O'er high Pieria thence her course she bore,
LINE 280: O'er fair Emathia's ever-pleasing shore,
LINE 281: O'er Hemus' hills with snows eternal crown'd;
LINE 282: Nor once her flying foot approach'd the ground.
LINE 283: Then taking wing from Athos' lofty steep,
LINE 284: She speeds to Lemnos o'er the rolling deep,
LINE 285: And seeks the cave of Death's half-brother, Sleep.[234]
LINE 286: "Sweet pleasing Sleep! (Saturnia thus began)
LINE 287: Who spread'st thy empire o'er each god and man;
LINE 288: If e'er obsequious to thy Juno's will,
LINE 289: O power of slumbers! hear, and favour still.
LINE 290: Shed thy soft dews on Jove's immortal eyes,
LINE 291: While sunk in love's entrancing joys he lies.
LINE 292: A splendid footstool, and a throne, that shine
LINE 293: With gold unfading, Somnus, shall be thine;
LINE 294: The work of Vulcan; to indulge thy ease,
LINE 295: When wine and feasts thy golden humours please."
LINE 296: "Imperial dame (the balmy power replies),
LINE 297: Great Saturn's heir, and empress of the skies!
LINE 298: O'er other gods I spread my easy chain;
LINE 299: The sire of all, old Ocean, owns my reign.
LINE 300: And his hush'd waves lie silent on the main.
LINE 301: But how, unbidden, shall I dare to steep
LINE 302: Jove's awful temples in the dew of sleep?
LINE 303: Long since, too venturous, at thy bold command,
LINE 304: On those eternal lids I laid my hand;
LINE 305: What time, deserting Ilion's wasted plain,
LINE 306: His conquering son, Alcides, plough'd the main.
LINE 307: When lo! the deeps arise, the tempests roar,
LINE 308: And drive the hero to the Coan shore:
LINE 309: Great Jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes
LINE 310: With rising wrath, and tumbled gods on gods;
LINE 311: Me chief he sought, and from the realms on high
LINE 312: Had hurl'd indignant to the nether sky,
LINE 313: But gentle Night, to whom I fled for aid,
LINE 314: (The friend of earth and heaven,) her wings display'd;
LINE 315: Impower'd the wrath of gods and men to tame,
LINE 316: Even Jove revered the venerable dame."
LINE 317: "Vain are thy fears (the queen of heaven replies,
LINE 318: And, speaking, rolls her large majestic eyes);
LINE 319: Think'st thou that Troy has Jove's high favour won,
LINE 320: Like great Alcides, his all-conquering son?
LINE 321: Hear, and obey the mistress of the skies,
LINE 322: Nor for the deed expect a vulgar prize;
LINE 323: For know, thy loved-one shall be ever thine,
LINE 324: The youngest Grace, PasithaÃ« the divine."[235]
LINE 325: "Swear then (he said) by those tremendous floods
LINE 326: That roar through hell, and bind the invoking gods:
LINE 327: Let the great parent earth one hand sustain,
LINE 328: And stretch the other o'er the sacred main:
LINE 329: Call the black Titans, that with Chronos dwell,
LINE 330: To hear and witness from the depths of hell;
LINE 331: That she, my loved-one, shall be ever mine,
LINE 332: The youngest Grace, PasithaÃ« the divine."
LINE 333: The queen assents, and from the infernal bowers
LINE 334: Invokes the sable subtartarean powers,
LINE 335: And those who rule the inviolable floods,
LINE 336: Whom mortals name the dread Titanian gods.
LINE 337: [Illustration: ] SLEEP ESCAPING FROM THE WRATH OF JUPITER
LINE 338: Then swift as wind, o'er Lemnos' smoky isle
LINE 339: They wing their way, and Imbrus' sea-beat soil;
LINE 340: Through air, unseen, involved in darkness glide,
LINE 341: And light on Lectos, on the point of Ide:
LINE 342: (Mother of savages, whose echoing hills
LINE 343: Are heard resounding with a hundred rills:)
LINE 344: Fair Ida trembles underneath the god;
LINE 345: Hush'd are her mountains, and her forests nod.
LINE 346: There on a fir, whose spiry branches rise
LINE 347: To join its summit to the neighbouring skies;
LINE 348: Dark in embowering shade, conceal'd from sight,
LINE 349: Sat Sleep, in likeness of the bird of night.
LINE 350: (Chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth,
LINE 351: But call'd Cymindis by the race of earth.)
LINE 352: To Ida's top successful Juno flies;
LINE 353: Great Jove surveys her with desiring eyes:
LINE 354: The god, whose lightning sets the heavens on fire,
LINE 355: Through all his bosom feels the fierce desire;
LINE 356: Fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms,
LINE 357: Mix'd with her soul, and melted in her arms:
LINE 358: Fix'd on her eyes he fed his eager look,
LINE 359: Then press'd her hand, and thus with transport spoke:
LINE 360: "Why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky,
LINE 361: And not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh?"
LINE 362: Then sheâ€”"I haste to those remote abodes
LINE 363: Where the great parents of the deathless gods,
LINE 364: The reverend Ocean and gray Tethys, reign,
LINE 365: On the last limits of the land and main.
LINE 366: I visit these, to whose indulgent cares
LINE 367: I owe the nursing of my tender years:
LINE 368: For strife, I hear, has made that union cease
LINE 369: Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
LINE 370: The steeds, prepared my chariot to convey
LINE 371: O'er earth and seas, and through the aerial way,
LINE 372: Wait under Ide: of thy superior power
LINE 373: To ask consent, I leave the Olympian bower;
LINE 374: Nor seek, unknown to thee, the sacred cells
LINE 375: Deep under seas, where hoary Ocean dwells."
LINE 376: "For that (said Jove) suffice another day!
LINE 377: But eager love denies the least delay.
LINE 378: Let softer cares the present hour employ,
LINE 379: And be these moments sacred all to joy.
LINE 380: Ne'er did my soul so strong a passion prove,
LINE 381: Or for an earthly, or a heavenly love:
LINE 382: Not when I press'd Ixion's matchless dame,
LINE 383: Whence rose Pirithous like the gods in fame:
LINE 384: Not when fair Danae felt the shower of gold
LINE 385: Stream into life, whence Perseus brave and bold.
LINE 386: Not thus I burn'd for either Theban dame:
LINE 387: (Bacchus from this, from that Alcides came:)
LINE 388: Nor PhÅ“nix' daughter, beautiful and young,
LINE 389: Whence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung.[236]
LINE 390: Not thus I burn'd for fair Latona's face,
LINE 391: Nor comelier Ceres' more majestic grace.
LINE 392: Not thus even for thyself I felt desire,
LINE 393: As now my veins receive the pleasing fire."
LINE 394: He spoke; the goddess with the charming eyes
LINE 395: Glows with celestial red, and thus replies:
LINE 396: "Is this a scene for love? On Ida's height,
LINE 397: Exposed to mortal and immortal sight!
LINE 398: Our joys profaned by each familiar eye;
LINE 399: The sport of heaven, and fable of the sky:
LINE 400: How shall I e'er review the blest abodes,
LINE 401: Or mix among the senate of the gods?
LINE 402: Shall I not think, that, with disorder'd charms,
LINE 403: All heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?
LINE 404: With skill divine has Vulcan form'd thy bower,
LINE 405: Sacred to love and to the genial hour;
LINE 406: If such thy will, to that recess retire,
LINE 407: In secret there indulge thy soft desire."
LINE 408: She ceased; and, smiling with superior love,
LINE 409: Thus answer'd mild the cloud-compelling Jove:
LINE 410: "Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,
LINE 411: Shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold;
LINE 412: Not even the sun, who darts through heaven his rays,
LINE 413: And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys."
LINE 414: Gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,
LINE 415: His eager arms around the goddess threw.
LINE 416: Glad Earth perceives, and from her bosom pours
LINE 417: Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:
LINE 418: Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,
LINE 419: And clustering lotos swell'd the rising bed,
LINE 420: And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,[237]
LINE 421: And flamy crocus made the mountain glow
LINE 422: There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,
LINE 423: Steep'd in soft joys and circumfused with air;
LINE 424: Celestial dews, descending o'er the ground,
LINE 425: Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:
LINE 426: At length, with love and sleep's soft power oppress'd,
LINE 427: The panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.
LINE 428: Now to the navy borne on silent wings,
LINE 429: To Neptune's ear soft Sleep his message brings;
LINE 430: Beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,
LINE 431: And thus with gentle words address'd the god:
LINE 432: "Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ,
LINE 433: To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy:
LINE 434: While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed
LINE 435: The golden vision round his sacred head;
LINE 436: For Juno's love, and Somnus' pleasing ties,
LINE 437: Have closed those awful and eternal eyes."
LINE 438: Thus having said, the power of slumber flew,
LINE 439: On human lids to drop the balmy dew.
LINE 440: Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,
LINE 441: And towering in the foremost ranks of war,
LINE 442: Indignant thusâ€”"Oh once of martial fame!
LINE 443: O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!
LINE 444: This half-recover'd day shall Troy obtain?
LINE 445: Shall Hector thunder at your ships again?
LINE 446: Lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,
LINE 447: While stern Achilles in his wrath retires.
LINE 448: One hero's loss too tamely you deplore,
LINE 449: Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.
LINE 450: Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,
LINE 451: Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:
LINE 452: His strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield,
LINE 453: Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield;
LINE 454: Let to the weak the lighter arms belong,
LINE 455: The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.
LINE 456: Thus arm'd, not Hector shall our presence stay;
LINE 457: Myself, ye Greeks! myself will lead the way."
LINE 458: [Illustration: ] GREEK SHIELD
LINE 459: The troops assent; their martial arms they change:
LINE 460: The busy chiefs their banded legions range.
LINE 461: The kings, though wounded, and oppress'd with pain,
LINE 462: With helpful hands themselves assist the train.
LINE 463: The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,
LINE 464: The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.
LINE 465: Thus sheath'd in shining brass, in bright array
LINE 466: The legions march, and Neptune leads the way:
LINE 467: His brandish'd falchion flames before their eyes,
LINE 468: Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.
LINE 469: Clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears;
LINE 470: Pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.
LINE 471: Troy's great defender stands alone unawed,
LINE 472: Arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god:
LINE 473: And lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear:
LINE 474: The sea's stern ruler there, and Hector here.
LINE 475: The roaring main, at her great master's call,
LINE 476: Rose in huge ranks, and form'd a watery wall
LINE 477: Around the ships: seas hanging o'er the shores,
LINE 478: Both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.
LINE 479: Not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,
LINE 480: When stormy winds disclose the dark profound;
LINE 481: Less loud the winds that from the Ã†olian hall
LINE 482: Roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall;
LINE 483: Less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,
LINE 484: Catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour;
LINE 485: With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,
LINE 486: And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.
LINE 487: The first bold javelin, urged by Hector's force,
LINE 488: Direct at Ajax' bosom winged its course;
LINE 489: But there no pass the crossing belts afford,
LINE 490: (One braced his shield, and one sustain'd his sword.)
LINE 491: Then back the disappointed Trojan drew,
LINE 492: And cursed the lance that unavailing flew:
LINE 493: But 'scaped not Ajax; his tempestuous hand
LINE 494: A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,
LINE 495: (Where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior's feet,
LINE 496: Or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,)
LINE 497: Toss'd round and round, the missive marble flings;
LINE 498: On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,
LINE 499: Full on his breast and throat with force descends;
LINE 500: Nor deaden'd there its giddy fury spends,
LINE 501: But whirling on, with many a fiery round,
LINE 502: Smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.
LINE 503: As when the bolt, red-hissing from above,
LINE 504: Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove,
LINE 505: The mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,
LINE 506: Black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise;
LINE 507: Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,
LINE 508: And own the terrors of the almighty hand!
LINE 509: So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore;
LINE 510: His slacken'd hand deserts the lance it bore;
LINE 511: His following shield the fallen chief o'erspread;
LINE 512: Beneath his helmet dropp'd his fainting head;
LINE 513: His load of armour, sinking to the ground,
LINE 514: Clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.
LINE 515: Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain;
LINE 516: Greece sees, in hope, Troy's great defender slain:
LINE 517: All spring to seize him; storms of arrows fly,
LINE 518: And thicker javelins intercept the sky.
LINE 519: In vain an iron tempest hisses round;
LINE 520: He lies protected, and without a wound.[238]
LINE 521: Polydamas, Agenor the divine,
LINE 522: The pious warrior of Anchises' line,
LINE 523: And each bold leader of the Lycian band,
LINE 524: With covering shields (a friendly circle) stand,
LINE 525: His mournful followers, with assistant care,
LINE 526: The groaning hero to his chariot bear;
LINE 527: His foaming coursers, swifter than the wind,
LINE 528: Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.
LINE 529: When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side,
LINE 530: Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide,
LINE 531: With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,
LINE 532: Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.
LINE 533: Raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;
LINE 534: Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore;
LINE 535: By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,
LINE 536: And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.
LINE 537: Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld,
LINE 538: With double fury each invades the field.
LINE 539: Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped,
LINE 540: Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;
LINE 541: (Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neis bore
LINE 542: Amidst her flocks on Satnio's silver shore;)
LINE 543: Struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies
LINE 544: Supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes.
LINE 545: An arduous battle rose around the dead;
LINE 546: By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled.
LINE 547: Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,
LINE 548: And at ProthoÃ«nor shook the trembling spear;
LINE 549: The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust,
LINE 550: He sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
LINE 551: "Lo thus (the victor cries) we rule the field,
LINE 552: And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield:
LINE 553: From this unerring hand there flies no dart
LINE 554: But bathes its point within a Grecian heart.
LINE 555: Propp'd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,
LINE 556: Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto's dreary hall."
LINE 557: He said, and sorrow touch'd each Argive breast:
LINE 558: The soul of Ajax burn'd above the rest.
LINE 559: As by his side the groaning warrior fell,
LINE 560: At the fierce foe he launch'd his piercing steel;
LINE 561: The foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death;
LINE 562: But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:
LINE 563: Thy lofty birth no succour could impart,
LINE 564: The wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart;
LINE 565: Swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled
LINE 566: Full on the juncture of the neck and head,
LINE 567: And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain:
LINE 568: The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.
LINE 569: So just the stroke, that yet the body stood
LINE 570: Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.
LINE 571: "Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes!
LINE 572: (The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:)
LINE 573: Say, is this chief extended on the plain
LINE 574: A worthy vengeance for ProthoÃ«nor slain?
LINE 575: Mark well his port! his figure and his face
LINE 576: Nor speak him vulgar, nor of vulgar race;
LINE 577: Some lines, methinks, may make his lineage known,
LINE 578: Antenor's brother, or perhaps his son."
LINE 579: He spake, and smiled severe, for well he knew
LINE 580: The bleeding youth: Troy sadden'd at the view.
LINE 581: But furious Acamas avenged his cause;
LINE 582: As Promachus his slaughtered brother draws,
LINE 583: He pierced his heartâ€”"Such fate attends you all,
LINE 584: Proud Argives! destined by our arms to fall.
LINE 585: Not Troy alone, but haughty Greece, shall share
LINE 586: The toils, the sorrows, and the wounds of war.
LINE 587: Behold your Promachus deprived of breath,
LINE 588: A victim owed to my brave brother's death.
LINE 589: Not unappeased he enters Pluto's gate,
LINE 590: Who leaves a brother to revenge his fate."
LINE 591: Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian host,
LINE 592: But touch'd the breast of bold Peneleus most;
LINE 593: At the proud boaster he directs his course;
LINE 594: The boaster flies, and shuns superior force.
LINE 595: But young Ilioneus received the spear;
LINE 596: Ilioneus, his father's only care:
LINE 597: (Phorbas the rich, of all the Trojan train
LINE 598: Whom Hermes loved, and taught the arts of gain:)
LINE 599: Full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall,
LINE 600: And from the fibres scoop'd the rooted ball,
LINE 601: Drove through the neck, and hurl'd him to the plain;
LINE 602: He lifts his miserable arms in vain!
LINE 603: Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread,
LINE 604: And from the spouting shoulders struck his head;
LINE 605: To earth at once the head and helmet fly;
LINE 606: The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,
LINE 607: The victor seized; and, as aloft he shook
LINE 608: The gory visage, thus insulting spoke:
LINE 609: "Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold!
LINE 610: Haste, to his father let the tale be told:
LINE 611: Let his high roofs resound with frantic woe,
LINE 612: Such as the house of Promachus must know;
LINE 613: Let doleful tidings greet his mother's ear,
LINE 614: Such as to Promachus' sad spouse we bear,
LINE 615: When we victorious shall to Greece return,
LINE 616: And the pale matron in our triumphs mourn."
LINE 617: Dreadful he spoke, then toss'd the head on high;
LINE 618: The Trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly:
LINE 619: Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall,
LINE 620: And dread the ruin that impends on all.
LINE 621: Daughters of Jove! that on Olympus shine,
LINE 622: Ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!
LINE 623: O say, when Neptune made proud Ilion yield,
LINE 624: What chief, what hero first embrued the field?
LINE 625: Of all the Grecians what immortal name,
LINE 626: And whose bless'd trophies, will ye raise to fame?
LINE 627: Thou first, great Ajax! on the unsanguined plain
LINE 628: Laid Hyrtius, leader of the Mysian train.
LINE 629: Phalces and Mermer, Nestor's son o'erthrew,
LINE 630: Bold Merion, Morys and Hippotion slew.
LINE 631: Strong Periphaetes and Prothoon bled,
LINE 632: By Teucer's arrows mingled with the dead,
LINE 633: Pierced in the flank by Menelaus' steel,
LINE 634: His people's pastor, Hyperenor fell;
LINE 635: Eternal darkness wrapp'd the warrior round,
LINE 636: And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.
LINE 637: But stretch'd in heaps before OÃ¯leus' son,
LINE 638: Fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run;
LINE 639: Ajax the less, of all the Grecian race
LINE 640: Skill'd in pursuit, and swiftest in the chase.
