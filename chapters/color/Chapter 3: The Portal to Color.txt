LINE 17: Zephyr floated beside her, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "This, my dear
LINE 18: Lila, is no ordinary mural. It's a gatewayâ€”a portal to a hidden realm of

LINE 24: breathed, her fingers tracing the outlines of the painted forms. "But how do we
LINE 25: unlock it?"
LINE 26: Zephyr's expression shifted to one of encouragement. "You must connect with it,
LINE 27: feel its energy. The mural responds to your creativity and intent." He gestured

LINE 45: "Now, Lila, you must take the final step to activate the portal!" Zephyr
LINE 46: encouraged, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "You have to step through!" The
LINE 47: thought sent a thrill of fear and exhilaration coursing through her. Could she
LINE 48: really do it?
LINE 49: "Step through?" she echoed, her voice trembling slightly. "What if it's
LINE 50: dangerous?" Lila's mind raced with possibilities, but the allure of the unknown
LINE 51: was too strong to resist. She glanced at Zephyr, who nodded encouragingly, his
