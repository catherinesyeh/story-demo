LINE 1: October 24th.—Thank Heaven, I am free and safe at last. Early we rose,
LINE 2: swiftly and quietly dressed, slowly and stealthily descended to the
LINE 3: hall, where Benson stood ready with a light, to open the door and
LINE 4: fasten it after us. We were obliged to let one man into our secret on
LINE 5: account of the boxes, &c. All the servants were but too well acquainted
LINE 6: with their master's conduct, and either Benson or John would have been
LINE 7: willing to serve me; but as the former was more staid and elderly, and
LINE 8: a crony of Rachel's besides, I of course directed her to make choice of
LINE 9: him as her assistant and confidant on the occasion, as far as necessity
LINE 10: demanded, I only hope he may not be brought into trouble thereby, and
LINE 11: only wish I could reward him for the perilous service he was so ready
LINE 12: to undertake. I slipped two guineas into his hand, by way of
LINE 13: remembrance, as he stood in the doorway, holding the candle to light
LINE 14: our departure, with a tear in his honest grey eye, and a host of good
LINE 15: wishes depicted on his solemn countenance. Alas! I could offer no more:
LINE 16: I had barely sufficient remaining for the probable expenses of the
LINE 17: journey.
LINE 18: What trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us, as
LINE 19: we issued from the park! Then, for one moment, I paused, to inhale one
LINE 20: draught of that cool, bracing air, and venture one look back upon the
LINE 21: house. All was dark and still: no light glimmered in the windows, no
LINE 22: wreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty
LINE 23: sky. As I bade farewell for ever to that place, the scene of so much
LINE 24: guilt and misery, I felt glad that I had not left it before, for now
LINE 25: there was no doubt about the propriety of such a step—no shadow of
LINE 26: remorse for him I left behind. There was nothing to disturb my joy but
LINE 27: the fear of detection; and every step removed us further from the
LINE 28: chance of that.
LINE 29: We had left Grassdale many miles behind us before the round red sun
LINE 30: arose to welcome our deliverance; and if any inhabitant of its vicinity
LINE 31: had chanced to see us then, as we bowled along on the top of the coach,
LINE 32: I scarcely think they would have suspected our identity. As I intend to
LINE 33: be taken for a widow, I thought it advisable to enter my new abode in
LINE 34: mourning: I was, therefore, attired in a plain black silk dress and
LINE 35: mantle, a black veil (which I kept carefully over my face for the first
LINE 36: twenty or thirty miles of the journey), and a black silk bonnet, which
LINE 37: I had been constrained to borrow of Rachel, for want of such an article
LINE 38: myself. It was not in the newest fashion, of course; but none the worse
LINE 39: for that, under present circumstances. Arthur was clad in his plainest
LINE 40: clothes, and wrapped in a coarse woollen shawl; and Rachel was muffled
LINE 41: in a grey cloak and hood that had seen better days, and gave her more
LINE 42: the appearance of an ordinary though decent old woman, than of a
LINE 43: lady's-maid.
LINE 44: Oh, what delight it was to be thus seated aloft, rumbling along the
LINE 45: broad, sunshiny road, with the fresh morning breeze in my face,
LINE 46: surrounded by an unknown country, all smiling—cheerfully, gloriously
LINE 47: smiling in the yellow lustre of those early beams; with my darling
LINE 48: child in my arms, almost as happy as myself, and my faithful friend
LINE 49: beside me: a prison and despair behind me, receding further, further
LINE 50: back at every clatter of the horses' feet; and liberty and hope before!
LINE 51: I could hardly refrain from praising God aloud for my deliverance, or
LINE 52: astonishing my fellow-passengers by some surprising outburst of
LINE 53: hilarity.
LINE 54: But the journey was a very long one, and we were all weary enough
LINE 55: before the close of it. It was far into the night when we reached the
LINE 56: town of L——, and still we were seven miles from our journey's end; and
LINE 57: there was no more coaching, nor any conveyance to be had, except a
LINE 58: common cart, and that with the greatest difficulty, for half the town
LINE 59: was in bed. And a dreary ride we had of it, that last stage of the
LINE 60: journey, cold and weary as we were; sitting on our boxes, with nothing
LINE 61: to cling to, nothing to lean against, slowly dragged and cruelly shaken
LINE 62: over the rough, hilly roads. But Arthur was asleep in Rachel's lap, and
LINE 63: between us we managed pretty well to shield him from the cold night
LINE 64: air.
LINE 65: At last we began to ascend a terribly steep and stony lane, which, in
LINE 66: spite of the darkness, Rachel said she remembered well: she had often
LINE 67: walked there with me in her arms, and little thought to come again so
LINE 68: many years after, under such circumstances as the present. Arthur being
LINE 69: now awakened by the jolting and the stoppages, we all got out and
LINE 70: walked. We had not far to go; but what if Frederick should not have
LINE 71: received my letter? or if he should not have had time to prepare the
LINE 72: rooms for our reception, and we should find them all dark, damp, and
LINE 73: comfortless, destitute of food, fire, and furniture, after all our
LINE 74: toil?
LINE 75: At length the grim, dark pile appeared before us. The lane conducted us
LINE 76: round by the back way. We entered the desolate court, and in breathless
LINE 77: anxiety surveyed the ruinous mass. Was it all blackness and desolation?
LINE 78: No; one faint red glimmer cheered us from a window where the lattice
LINE 79: was in good repair. The door was fastened, but after due knocking and
LINE 80: waiting, and some parleying with a voice from an upper window, we were
LINE 81: admitted by an old woman who had been commissioned to air and keep the
LINE 82: house till our arrival, into a tolerably snug little apartment,
LINE 83: formerly the scullery of the mansion, which Frederick had now fitted up
LINE 84: as a kitchen. Here she procured us a light, roused the fire to a
LINE 85: cheerful blaze, and soon prepared a simple repast for our refreshment;
LINE 86: while we disencumbered ourselves of our travelling-gear, and took a
LINE 87: hasty survey of our new abode. Besides the kitchen, there were two
LINE 88: bedrooms, a good-sized parlour, and another smaller one, which I
LINE 89: destined for my studio, all well aired and seemingly in good repair,
LINE 90: but only partly furnished with a few old articles, chiefly of ponderous
LINE 91: black oak, the veritable ones that had been there before, and which had
LINE 92: been kept as antiquarian relics in my brother's present residence, and
LINE 93: now, in all haste, transported back again.
LINE 94: The old woman brought my supper and Arthur's into the parlour, and told
LINE 95: me, with all due formality, that "the master desired his compliments to
LINE 96: Mrs. Graham, and he had prepared the rooms as well as he could upon so
LINE 97: short a notice; but he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon
LINE 98: her to-morrow, to receive her further commands."
LINE 99: I was glad to ascend the stern-looking stone staircase, and lie down in
LINE 100: the gloomy, old-fashioned bed, beside my little Arthur. He was asleep
LINE 101: in a minute; but, weary as I was, my excited feelings and restless
LINE 102: cogitations kept me awake till dawn began to struggle with the
LINE 103: darkness; but sleep was sweet and refreshing when it came, and the
LINE 104: waking was delightful beyond expression. It was little Arthur that
LINE 105: roused me, with his gentle kisses. He was here, then, safely clasped in
LINE 106: my arms, and many leagues away from his unworthy father! Broad daylight
LINE 107: illumined the apartment, for the sun was high in heaven, though
LINE 108: obscured by rolling masses of autumnal vapour.
LINE 109: The scene, indeed, was not remarkably cheerful in itself, either within
LINE 110: or without. The large bare room, with its grim old furniture, the
LINE 111: narrow, latticed windows, revealing the dull, grey sky above and the
LINE 112: desolate wilderness below, where the dark stone walls and iron gate,
LINE 113: the rank growth of grass and weeds, and the hardy evergreens of
LINE 114: preternatural forms, alone remained to tell that there had been once a
LINE 115: garden,—and the bleak and barren fields beyond might have struck me as
LINE 116: gloomy enough at another time; but now, each separate object seemed to
LINE 117: echo back my own exhilarating sense of hope and freedom: indefinite
LINE 118: dreams of the far past and bright anticipations of the future seemed to
LINE 119: greet me at every turn. I should rejoice with more security, to be
LINE 120: sure, had the broad sea rolled between my present and my former homes;
LINE 121: but surely in this lonely spot I might remain unknown; and then I had
LINE 122: my brother here to cheer my solitude with his occasional visits.
LINE 123: He came that morning; and I have had several interviews with him since;
LINE 124: but he is obliged to be very cautious when and how he comes; not even
LINE 125: his servants or his best friends must know of his visits to
LINE 126: Wildfell—except on such occasions as a landlord might be expected to
LINE 127: call upon a stranger tenant—lest suspicion should be excited against
LINE 128: me, whether of the truth or of some slanderous falsehood.
LINE 129: I have now been here nearly a fortnight, and, but for one disturbing
LINE 130: care, the haunting dread of discovery, I am comfortably settled in my
LINE 131: new home: Frederick has supplied me with all requisite furniture and
LINE 132: painting materials: Rachel has sold most of my clothes for me, in a
LINE 133: distant town, and procured me a wardrobe more suitable to my present
LINE 134: position: I have a second-hand piano, and a tolerably well-stocked
LINE 135: bookcase in my parlour; and my other room has assumed quite a
LINE 136: professional, business-like appearance already. I am working hard to
LINE 137: repay my brother for all his expenses on my account; not that there is
LINE 138: the slightest necessity for anything of the kind, but it pleases me to
LINE 139: do so: I shall have so much more pleasure in my labour, my earnings, my
LINE 140: frugal fare, and household economy, when I know that I am paying my way
LINE 141: honestly, and that what little I possess is legitimately all my own;
LINE 142: and that no one suffers for my folly—in a pecuniary way at least. I
LINE 143: shall make him take the last penny I owe him, if I can possibly effect
LINE 144: it without offending him too deeply. I have a few pictures already
LINE 145: done, for I told Rachel to pack up all I had; and she executed her
LINE 146: commission but too well—for among the rest, she put up a portrait of
LINE 147: Mr. Huntingdon that I had painted in the first year of my marriage. It
LINE 148: struck me with dismay, at the moment, when I took it from the box and
LINE 149: beheld those eyes fixed upon me in their mocking mirth, as if exulting
LINE 150: still in his power to control my fate, and deriding my efforts to
LINE 151: escape.
LINE 152: How widely different had been my feelings in painting that portrait to
LINE 153: what they now were in looking upon it! How I had studied and toiled to
LINE 154: produce something, as I thought, worthy of the original! what mingled
LINE 155: pleasure and dissatisfaction I had had in the result of my
LINE 156: labours!—pleasure for the likeness I had caught; dissatisfaction,
LINE 157: because I had not made it handsome enough. Now, I see no beauty in
LINE 158: it—nothing pleasing in any part of its expression; and yet it is far
LINE 159: handsomer and far more agreeable—far less repulsive I should rather
LINE 160: say—than he is now: for these six years have wrought almost as great a
LINE 161: change upon himself as on my feelings regarding him. The frame,
LINE 162: however, is handsome enough; it will serve for another painting. The
LINE 163: picture itself I have not destroyed, as I had first intended; I have
LINE 164: put it aside; not, I think, from any lurking tenderness for the memory
LINE 165: of past affection, nor yet to remind me of my former folly, but chiefly
LINE 166: that I may compare my son's features and countenance with this, as he
LINE 167: grows up, and thus be enabled to judge how much or how little he
LINE 168: resembles his father—if I may be allowed to keep him with me still, and
LINE 169: never to behold that father's face again—a blessing I hardly dare
LINE 170: reckon upon.
LINE 171: It seems Mr. Huntingdon is making every exertion to discover the place
LINE 172: of my retreat. He has been in person to Staningley, seeking redress for
LINE 173: his grievances—expecting to hear of his victims, if not to find them
LINE 174: there—and has told so many lies, and with such unblushing coolness,
LINE 175: that my uncle more than half believes him, and strongly advocates my
LINE 176: going back to him and being friends again. But my aunt knows better:
LINE 177: she is too cool and cautious, and too well acquainted with both my
LINE 178: husband's character and my own to be imposed upon by any specious
LINE 179: falsehoods the former could invent. But he does not _want_ me back; he
LINE 180: wants my child; and gives my friends to understand that if I prefer
LINE 181: living apart from him, he will indulge the whim and let me do so
LINE 182: unmolested, and even settle a reasonable allowance on me, provided I
LINE 183: will immediately deliver up his son. But heaven help me! I am not going
LINE 184: to sell my child for gold, though it were to save both him and me from
LINE 185: starving: it would be better that he should die with me than that he
LINE 186: should live with his father.
LINE 187: Frederick showed me a letter he had received from that gentleman, full
LINE 188: of cool impudence such as would astonish any one who did not know him,
LINE 189: but such as, I am convinced, none would know better how to answer than
LINE 190: my brother. He gave me no account of his reply, except to tell me that
LINE 191: he had not acknowledged his acquaintance with my place of refuge, but
LINE 192: rather left it to be inferred that it was quite unknown to him, by
LINE 193: saying it was useless to apply to him, or any other of my relations,
LINE 194: for information on the subject, as it appeared I had been driven to
LINE 195: such extremity that I had concealed my retreat even from my best
LINE 196: friends; but that if he _had_ known it, or should at any time be made
LINE 197: aware of it, most certainly Mr. Huntingdon would be the last person to
LINE 198: whom he should communicate the intelligence; and that he need not
LINE 199: trouble himself to bargain for the child, for he (Frederick) fancied he
LINE 200: knew enough of his sister to enable him to declare, that wherever she
LINE 201: might be, or however situated, no consideration would induce her to
LINE 202: deliver him up.
LINE 203: 30th.—Alas! my kind neighbours will not let me alone. By some means
LINE 204: they have ferreted me out, and I have had to sustain visits from three
LINE 205: different families, all more or less bent upon discovering who and what
LINE 206: I am, whence I came, and why I have chosen such a home as this. Their
LINE 207: society is unnecessary to me, to say the least, and their curiosity
LINE 208: annoys and alarms me: if I gratify it, it may lead to the ruin of my
LINE 209: son, and if I am too mysterious it will only excite their suspicions,
LINE 210: invite conjecture, and rouse them to greater exertions—and perhaps be
LINE 211: the means of spreading my fame from parish to parish, till it reach the
LINE 212: ears of some one who will carry it to the Lord of Grassdale Manor.
LINE 213: I shall be expected to return their calls, but if, upon inquiry, I find
LINE 214: that any of them live too far away for Arthur to accompany me, they
LINE 215: must expect in vain for a while, for I cannot bear to leave him, unless
LINE 216: it be to go to church, and I have not attempted _that_ yet: for—it may
LINE 217: be foolish weakness, but I am under such constant dread of his being
LINE 218: snatched away, that I am never easy when he is not by my side; and I
LINE 219: fear these nervous terrors would so entirely disturb my devotions, that
LINE 220: I should obtain no benefit from the attendance. I mean, however, to
LINE 221: make the experiment next Sunday, and oblige myself to leave him in
LINE 222: charge of Rachel for a few hours. It will be a hard task, but surely no
LINE 223: imprudence; and the vicar has been to scold me for my neglect of the
LINE 224: ordinances of religion. I had no sufficient excuse to offer, and I
LINE 225: promised, if all were well, he should see me in my pew next Sunday; for
LINE 226: I do not wish to be set down as an infidel; and, besides, I know I
LINE 227: should derive great comfort and benefit from an occasional attendance
LINE 228: at public worship, if I could only have faith and fortitude to compose
LINE 229: my thoughts in conformity with the solemn occasion, and forbid them to
LINE 230: be for ever dwelling on my absent child, and on the dreadful
LINE 231: possibility of finding him gone when I return; and surely God in His
LINE 232: mercy will preserve me from so severe a trial: for my child's own sake,
LINE 233: if not for mine, He will not suffer him to be torn away.
LINE 234: November 3rd.—I have made some further acquaintance with my neighbours.
LINE 235: The fine gentleman and beau of the parish and its vicinity (in his own
LINE 236: estimation, at least) is a young . . . .
LINE 237: * * * * *
LINE 238: Here it ended. The rest was torn away. How cruel, just when she was
LINE 239: going to mention me! for I could not doubt it _was_ your humble servant
LINE 240: she was about to mention, though not very favourably, of course. I
LINE 241: could tell that, as well by those few words as by the recollection of
LINE 242: her whole aspect and demeanour towards me in the commencement of our
LINE 243: acquaintance. Well! I could readily forgive her prejudice against me,
LINE 244: and her hard thoughts of our sex in general, when I saw to what
LINE 245: brilliant specimens her experience had been limited.
LINE 246: Respecting me, however, she had long since seen her error, and perhaps
LINE 247: fallen into another in the opposite extreme: for if, at first, her
LINE 248: opinion of me had been lower than I deserved, I was convinced that now
LINE 249: my deserts were lower than her opinion; and if the former part of this
LINE 250: continuation had been torn away to avoid wounding my feelings, perhaps
LINE 251: the latter portion had been removed for fear of ministering too much to
LINE 252: my self-conceit. At any rate, I would have given much to have seen it
LINE 253: all—to have witnessed the gradual change, and watched the progress of
LINE 254: her esteem and friendship for me, and whatever warmer feeling she might
LINE 255: have; to have seen how much of love there was in her regard, and how it
LINE 256: had grown upon her in spite of her virtuous resolutions and strenuous
LINE 257: exertions to—but no, I had no right to see it: all this was too sacred
LINE 258: for any eyes but her own, and she had done well to keep it from me.
