LINE 1: March 20th.—Having now got rid of Mr. Huntingdon for a season, my
LINE 2: spirits begin to revive. He left me early in February; and the moment
LINE 3: he was gone, I breathed again, and felt my vital energy return; not
LINE 4: with the hope of escape—he has taken care to leave me no visible chance
LINE 5: of that—but with a determination to make the best of existing
LINE 6: circumstances. Here was Arthur left to me at last; and rousing from my
LINE 7: despondent apathy, I exerted all my powers to eradicate the weeds that
LINE 8: had been fostered in his infant mind, and sow again the good seed they
LINE 9: had rendered unproductive. Thank heaven, it is not a barren or a stony
LINE 10: soil; if weeds spring fast there, so do better plants. His
LINE 11: apprehensions are more quick, his heart more overflowing with affection
LINE 12: than ever his father's could have been, and it is no hopeless task to
LINE 13: bend him to obedience and win him to love and know his own true friend,
LINE 14: as long as there is no one to counteract my efforts.
LINE 15: I had much trouble at first in breaking him of those evil habits his
LINE 16: father had taught him to acquire, but already that difficulty is nearly
LINE 17: vanquished now: bad language seldom defiles his mouth, and I have
LINE 18: succeeded in giving him an absolute disgust for all intoxicating
LINE 19: liquors, which I hope not even his father or his father's friends will
LINE 20: be able to overcome. He was inordinately fond of them for so young a
LINE 21: creature, and, remembering my unfortunate father as well as his, I
LINE 22: dreaded the consequences of such a taste. But if I had stinted him, in
LINE 23: his usual quantity of wine, or forbidden him to taste it altogether,
LINE 24: that would only have increased his partiality for it, and made him
LINE 25: regard it as a greater treat than ever. I therefore gave him quite as
LINE 26: much as his father was accustomed to allow him; as much, indeed, as he
LINE 27: desired to have—but into every glass I surreptitiously introduced a
LINE 28: small quantity of tartar-emetic, just enough to produce inevitable
LINE 29: nausea and depression without positive sickness. Finding such
LINE 30: disagreeable consequences invariably to result from this indulgence, he
LINE 31: soon grew weary of it, but the more he shrank from the daily treat the
LINE 32: more I pressed it upon him, till his reluctance was strengthened to
LINE 33: perfect abhorrence. When he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind of
LINE 34: wine, I allowed him, at his own request, to try brandy-and-water, and
LINE 35: then gin-and-water, for the little toper was familiar with them all,
LINE 36: and I was determined that all should be equally hateful to him. This I
LINE 37: have now effected; and since he declares that the taste, the smell, the
LINE 38: sight of any one of them is sufficient to make him sick, I have given
LINE 39: up teasing him about them, except now and then as objects of terror in
LINE 40: cases of misbehaviour. "Arthur, if you're not a good boy I shall give
LINE 41: you a glass of wine," or "Now, Arthur, if you say that again you shall
LINE 42: have some brandy-and-water," is as good as any other threat; and once
LINE 43: or twice, when he was sick, I have obliged the poor child to swallow a
LINE 44: little wine-and-water _without_ the tartar-emetic, by way of medicine;
LINE 45: and this practice I intend to continue for some time to come; not that
LINE 46: I think it of any real service in a physical sense, but because I am
LINE 47: determined to enlist all the powers of association in my service; I
LINE 48: wish this aversion to be so deeply grounded in his nature that nothing
LINE 49: in after-life may be able to overcome it.
LINE 50: Thus, I flatter myself, I shall secure him from this one vice; and for
LINE 51: the rest, if on his father's return I find reason to apprehend that my
LINE 52: good lessons will be all destroyed—if Mr. Huntingdon commence again the
LINE 53: game of teaching the child to hate and despise his mother, and emulate
LINE 54: his father's wickedness—I will yet deliver my son from his hands. I
LINE 55: have devised another scheme that might be resorted to in such a case;
LINE 56: and if I could but obtain my brother's consent and assistance, I should
LINE 57: not doubt of its success. The old hall where he and I were born, and
LINE 58: where our mother died, is not now inhabited, nor yet quite sunk into
LINE 59: decay, as I believe. Now, if I could persuade him to have one or two
LINE 60: rooms made habitable, and to let them to me as a stranger, I might live
LINE 61: there, with my child, under an assumed name, and still support myself
LINE 62: by my favourite art. He should lend me the money to begin with, and I
LINE 63: would pay him back, and live in lowly independence and strict
LINE 64: seclusion, for the house stands in a lonely place, and the
LINE 65: neighbourhood is thinly inhabited, and he himself should negotiate the
LINE 66: sale of my pictures for me. I have arranged the whole plan in my head:
LINE 67: and all I want is to persuade Frederick to be of the same mind as
LINE 68: myself. He is coming to see me soon, and then I will make the proposal
LINE 69: to him, having first enlightened him upon my circumstances sufficiently
LINE 70: to excuse the project.
LINE 71: Already, I believe, he knows much more of my situation than I have told
LINE 72: him. I can tell this by the air of tender sadness pervading his
LINE 73: letters; and by the fact of his so seldom mentioning my husband, and
LINE 74: generally evincing a kind of covert bitterness when he does refer to
LINE 75: him; as well as by the circumstance of his never coming to see me when
LINE 76: Mr. Huntingdon is at home. But he has never openly expressed any
LINE 77: disapprobation of him or sympathy for me; he has never asked any
LINE 78: questions, or said anything to invite my confidence. Had he done so, I
LINE 79: should probably have had but few concealments from him. Perhaps he
LINE 80: feels hurt at my reserve. He is a strange being; I wish we knew each
LINE 81: other better. He used to spend a month at Staningley every year, before
LINE 82: I was married; but, since our father's death, I have only seen him
LINE 83: once, when he came for a few days while Mr. Huntingdon was away. He
LINE 84: shall stay many days this time, and there shall be more candour and
LINE 85: cordiality between us than ever there was before, since our early
LINE 86: childhood. My heart clings to him more than ever; and my soul is sick
LINE 87: of solitude.
LINE 88: April 16th.—He is come and gone. He would not stay above a fortnight.
LINE 89: The time passed quickly, but very, very happily, and it has done me
LINE 90: good. I must have a bad disposition, for my misfortunes have soured and
LINE 91: embittered me exceedingly: I was beginning insensibly to cherish very
LINE 92: unamiable feelings against my fellow-mortals, the male part of them
LINE 93: especially; but it is a comfort to see there is at least one among them
LINE 94: worthy to be trusted and esteemed; and doubtless there are more, though
LINE 95: I have never known them, unless I except poor Lord Lowborough, and he
LINE 96: was bad enough in his day. But what would Frederick have been, if he
LINE 97: had lived in the world, and mingled from his childhood with such men as
LINE 98: these of my acquaintance? and what _will_ Arthur be, with all his
LINE 99: natural sweetness of disposition, if I do not save him from that world
LINE 100: and those companions? I mentioned my fears to Frederick, and introduced
LINE 101: the subject of my plan of rescue on the evening after his arrival, when
LINE 102: I presented my little son to his uncle.
LINE 103: "He is like you, Frederick," said I, "in some of his moods: I sometimes
LINE 104: think he resembles you more than his father; and I am glad of it."
LINE 105: "You flatter me, Helen," replied he, stroking the child's soft, wavy
LINE 106: locks.
LINE 107: "No, you will think it no compliment when I tell you I would rather
LINE 108: have him to resemble _Benson_ than his father."
LINE 109: He slightly elevated his eyebrows, but said nothing.
LINE 110: "Do you know what sort of man Mr. Huntingdon is?" said I.
LINE 111: "I think I have an idea."
LINE 112: "Have you so clear an idea that you can hear, without surprise or
LINE 113: disapproval, that I meditate escaping with that child to some secret
LINE 114: asylum, where we can live in peace, and never see him again?"
LINE 115: "Is it really so?"
LINE 116: "If you have not," continued I, "I'll tell you something more about
LINE 117: him"; and I gave a sketch of his general conduct, and a more particular
LINE 118: account of his behaviour with regard to his child, and explained my
LINE 119: apprehensions on the latter's account, and my determination to deliver
LINE 120: him from his father's influence.
LINE 121: Frederick was exceedingly indignant against Mr. Huntingdon, and very
LINE 122: much grieved for me; but still he looked upon my project as wild and
LINE 123: impracticable. He deemed my fears for Arthur disproportioned to the
LINE 124: circumstances, and opposed so many objections to my plan, and devised
LINE 125: so many milder methods for ameliorating my condition, that I was
LINE 126: obliged to enter into further details to convince him that my husband
LINE 127: was utterly incorrigible, and that nothing could persuade him to give
LINE 128: up his son, whatever became of me, he being as fully determined the
LINE 129: child should not leave him, as I was not to leave the child; and that,
LINE 130: in fact, nothing would answer but this, unless I fled the country, as I
LINE 131: had intended before. To obviate that, he at length consented to have
LINE 132: one wing of the old hall put into a habitable condition, as a place of
LINE 133: refuge against a time of need; but hoped I would not take advantage of
LINE 134: it unless circumstances should render it really necessary, which I was
LINE 135: ready enough to promise: for though, for my own sake, such a hermitage
LINE 136: appears like paradise itself, compared with my present situation, yet
LINE 137: for my friends' sakes, for Milicent and Esther, my sisters in heart and
LINE 138: affection, for the poor tenants of Grassdale, and, above all, for my
LINE 139: aunt, I will stay if I possibly can.
LINE 140: July 29th.—Mrs. Hargrave and her daughter are come back from London.
LINE 141: Esther is full of her first season in town; but she is still
LINE 142: heart-whole and unengaged. Her mother sought out an excellent match for
LINE 143: her, and even brought the gentleman to lay his heart and fortune at her
LINE 144: feet; but Esther had the audacity to refuse the noble gifts. He was a
LINE 145: man of good family and large possessions, but the naughty girl
LINE 146: maintained he was old as Adam, ugly as sin, and hateful as—one who
LINE 147: shall be nameless.
LINE 148: "But, indeed, I had a hard time of it," said she: "mamma was very
LINE 149: greatly disappointed at the failure of her darling project, and very,
LINE 150: very angry at my obstinate resistance to her will, and is so still; but
LINE 151: I can't help it. And Walter, too, is so seriously displeased at my
LINE 152: perversity and absurd caprice, as he calls it, that I fear he will
LINE 153: never forgive me—I did not think he _could_ be so unkind as he has
LINE 154: lately shown himself. But Milicent begged me not to yield, and I'm
LINE 155: sure, Mrs. Huntingdon, if you had seen the man they wanted to palm upon
LINE 156: me, you would have advised me not to take him too."
LINE 157: "I should have done so whether I had seen him or not," said I; "it is
LINE 158: enough that you dislike him."
LINE 159: "I knew you would say so; though mamma affirmed you would be quite
LINE 160: shocked at my undutiful conduct. You can't imagine how she lectures me:
LINE 161: I am disobedient and ungrateful; I am thwarting her wishes, wronging my
LINE 162: brother, and making myself a burden on her hands. I sometimes fear
LINE 163: she'll overcome me after all. I have a strong will, but so has she, and
LINE 164: when she says such bitter things, it provokes me to such a pass that I
LINE 165: feel inclined to do as she bids me, and then break my heart and say,
LINE 166: 'There, mamma, it's all your fault!'"
LINE 167: "Pray don't!" said I. "Obedience from such a motive would be positive
LINE 168: wickedness, and certain to bring the punishment it deserves. Stand
LINE 169: firm, and your mamma will soon relinquish her persecution; and the
LINE 170: gentleman himself will cease to pester you with his addresses if he
LINE 171: finds them steadily rejected."
LINE 172: "Oh, no! mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with
LINE 173: her exertions; and as for Mr. Oldfield, she has given him to understand
LINE 174: that I have refused his offer, not from any dislike of his person, but
LINE 175: merely because I am giddy and young, and cannot at present reconcile
LINE 176: myself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances: but by next
LINE 177: season, she has no doubt, I shall have more sense, and hopes my girlish
LINE 178: fancies will be worn away. So she has brought me home, to school me
LINE 179: into a proper sense of my duty, against the time comes round again.
LINE 180: Indeed, I believe she will not put herself to the expense of taking me
LINE 181: up to London again, unless I surrender: she cannot afford to take me to
LINE 182: town for pleasure and nonsense, she says, and it is not _every_ rich
LINE 183: gentleman that will consent to take me without a fortune, whatever
LINE 184: exalted ideas I may have of my own attractions."
LINE 185: "Well, Esther, I pity you; but still, I repeat, stand firm. You might
LINE 186: as well sell yourself to slavery at once, as marry a man you dislike.
LINE 187: If your mother and brother are unkind to you, you may leave them, but
LINE 188: remember you are bound to your husband for life."
LINE 189: "But I cannot leave them unless I get married, and I cannot get married
LINE 190: if nobody sees me. I saw one or two gentlemen in London that I might
LINE 191: have liked, but they were younger sons, and mamma would not let me get
LINE 192: to know them—one especially, who I believe rather liked me—but she
LINE 193: threw every possible obstacle in the way of our better acquaintance.
LINE 194: Wasn't it provoking?"
LINE 195: "I have no doubt you would feel it so, but it is possible that if you
LINE 196: married him, you might have more reason to regret it hereafter than if
LINE 197: you married Mr. Oldfield. When I tell you not to marry _without_ love,
LINE 198: I do not advise you to marry for love alone: there are many, many other
LINE 199: things to be considered. Keep both heart and hand in your own
LINE 200: possession, till you see good reason to part with them; and if such an
LINE 201: occasion should never present itself, comfort your mind with this
LINE 202: reflection, that though in single life your joys may not be very many,
LINE 203: your sorrows, at least, will not be more than you can bear. Marriage
LINE 204: _may_ change your circumstances for the better, but, in my private
LINE 205: opinion, it is far more likely to produce a contrary result."
LINE 206: "So thinks Milicent; but allow me to say _I_ think otherwise. If I
LINE 207: thought myself doomed to old-maidenhood, I should cease to value my
LINE 208: life. The thoughts of living on, year after year, at the Grove—a
LINE 209: hanger-on upon mamma and Walter, a mere cumberer of the ground (now
LINE 210: that I know in what light they would regard it), is perfectly
LINE 211: intolerable; I would rather run away with the butler."
LINE 212: "Your circumstances are peculiar, I allow; but have patience, love; do
LINE 213: nothing rashly. Remember you are not yet nineteen, and many years are
LINE 214: yet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid: you cannot
LINE 215: tell what Providence may have in store for you. And meantime, remember
LINE 216: you have a _right_ to the protection and support of your mother and
LINE 217: brother, however they may seem to grudge it."
LINE 218: "You are so grave, Mrs. Huntingdon," said Esther, after a pause. "When
LINE 219: Milicent uttered the same discouraging sentiments concerning marriage,
LINE 220: I asked if she was happy: she said she was; but I only half believed
LINE 221: her; and now I must put the same question to you."
LINE 222: "It is a very impertinent question," laughed I, "from a young girl to a
LINE 223: married woman so many years her senior, and I shall not answer it."
LINE 224: "Pardon me, dear _madam_," said she, laughingly throwing herself into
LINE 225: my arms, and kissing me with playful affection; but I felt a tear on my
LINE 226: neck, as she dropped her head on my bosom and continued, with an odd
LINE 227: mixture of sadness and levity, timidity and audacity,—"I know you are
LINE 228: not so happy as I mean to be, for you spend half your life alone at
LINE 229: Grassdale, while Mr. Huntingdon goes about enjoying himself where and
LINE 230: how he pleases. I shall expect _my_ husband to have no pleasures but
LINE 231: what he shares with me; and if his greatest pleasure of all is not the
LINE 232: enjoyment of my company, why, it will be the worse for him, that's
LINE 233: all."
LINE 234: "If such are your expectations of matrimony, Esther, you must, indeed,
LINE 235: be careful whom you marry—or rather, you must avoid it altogether."
