LINE 1: March 25th.—Arthur is getting tired—not of me, I trust, but of the
LINE 2: idle, quiet life he leads—and no wonder, for he has so few sources of
LINE 3: amusement: he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting
LINE 4: magazines; and when he sees me occupied with a book, he won't let me
LINE 5: rest till I close it. In fine weather he generally manages to get
LINE 6: through the time pretty well, but on rainy days, of which we have had a
LINE 7: good many of late, it is quite painful to witness his ennui. I do all I
LINE 8: can to amuse him, but it is impossible to get him to feel interested in
LINE 9: what I most like to talk about, while, on the other hand, he likes to
LINE 10: talk about things that cannot interest me—or even that annoy me—and
LINE 11: these please him—the most of all: for his favourite amusement is to sit
LINE 12: or loll beside me on the sofa, and tell me stories of his former
LINE 13: amours, always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl or the
LINE 14: cozening of some unsuspecting husband; and when I express my horror and
LINE 15: indignation, he lays it all to the charge of jealousy, and laughs till
LINE 16: the tears run down his cheeks. I used to fly into passions or melt into
LINE 17: tears at first, but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to
LINE 18: my anger and agitation, I have since endeavoured to suppress my
LINE 19: feelings and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt;
LINE 20: but still he reads the inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my
LINE 21: bitterness of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded
LINE 22: jealousy; and when he has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or
LINE 23: fears my displeasure will become too serious for his comfort, he tries
LINE 24: to kiss and soothe me into smiles again—never were his caresses so
LINE 25: little welcome as then! This is _double_ selfishness, displayed to me
LINE 26: and to the victims of his former love. There are times when, with a
LINE 27: momentary pang—a flash of wild dismay, I ask myself, "Helen, what have
LINE 28: you done?" But I rebuke the inward questioner, and repel the obtrusive
LINE 29: thoughts that crowd upon me; for were he ten times as sensual and
LINE 30: impenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have no right to
LINE 31: complain. And I don't and won't complain. I do and will love him still;
LINE 32: and I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate with his.
LINE 33: April 4th.—We have had a downright quarrel. The particulars are as
LINE 34: follows: Arthur had told me, at different intervals, the whole story of
LINE 35: his intrigue with Lady F——, which I would not believe before. It was
LINE 36: some consolation, however, to find that in this instance the lady had
LINE 37: been more to blame than he, for he was very young at the time, and she
LINE 38: had decidedly made the first advances, if what he said was true. I
LINE 39: hated her for it, for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to
LINE 40: his corruption; and when he was beginning to talk about her the other
LINE 41: day, I begged he would not mention her, for I detested the very sound
LINE 42: of her name.
LINE 43: "Not because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured you
LINE 44: and deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable woman,
LINE 45: whom you ought to be ashamed to mention."
LINE 46: But he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband, whom
LINE 47: it was impossible to love.
LINE 48: "Then why did she marry him?" said I.
LINE 49: "For his money," was the reply.
LINE 50: "Then that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and honour
LINE 51: him was another, that only increased the enormity of the last."
LINE 52: "You are too severe upon the poor lady," laughed he. "But never mind,
LINE 53: Helen, I don't care for her now; and I never loved any of them half as
LINE 54: much as I do you, so you needn't fear to be forsaken like them."
LINE 55: "If you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should have
LINE 56: given you the chance."
LINE 57: "_Wouldn't_ you, my darling?"
LINE 58: "Most certainly not!"
LINE 59: He laughed incredulously.
LINE 60: "I wish I could convince you of it now!" cried I, starting up from
LINE 61: beside him: and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last, I
LINE 62: wished I had not married him.
LINE 63: "Helen," said he, more gravely, "do you know that if I believed you now
LINE 64: I should be very angry? but thank heaven I don't. Though you stand
LINE 65: there with your white face and flashing eyes, looking at me like a very
LINE 66: tigress, I know the heart within you perhaps a trifle better than you
LINE 67: know it yourself."
LINE 68: Without another word I left the room and locked myself up in my own
LINE 69: chamber. In about half an hour he came to the door, and first he tried
LINE 70: the handle, then he knocked.
LINE 71: "Won't you let me in, Helen?" said he. "No; you have displeased me," I
LINE 72: replied, "and I don't want to see your face or hear your voice again
LINE 73: till the morning."
LINE 74: He paused a moment as if dumfounded or uncertain how to answer such a
LINE 75: speech, and then turned and walked away. This was only an hour after
LINE 76: dinner: I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening;
LINE 77: and this considerably softened my resentment, though it did not make me
LINE 78: relent. I was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave,
LINE 79: and I could live without him if I chose; and I sat down and wrote a
LINE 80: long letter to my aunt, of course telling her nothing of all this. Soon
LINE 81: after ten o'clock I heard him come up again, but he passed my door and
LINE 82: went straight to his own dressing-room, where he shut himself in for
LINE 83: the night.
LINE 84: I was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and
LINE 85: not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with a
LINE 86: careless smile.
LINE 87: "Are you cross still, Helen?" said he, approaching as if to salute me.
LINE 88: I coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee,
LINE 89: observing that he was rather late.
LINE 90: He uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where he
LINE 91: stood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen
LINE 92: grey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping leafless trees,
LINE 93: and muttering execrations on the weather, and then sat down to
LINE 94: breakfast. While taking his coffee he muttered it was "d—d cold."
LINE 95: "You should not have left it so long," said I.
LINE 96: He made no answer, and the meal was concluded in silence. It was a
LINE 97: relief to both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained upon
LINE 98: examination a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of
LINE 99: letters for me, which he tossed across the table without a remark. One
LINE 100: was from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in
LINE 101: London with her mother. His, I think, were business letters, and
LINE 102: apparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them into his pocket
LINE 103: with some muttered expletives that I should have reproved him for at
LINE 104: any other time. The paper he set before him, and pretended to be deeply
LINE 105: absorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast, and a
LINE 106: considerable time after.
LINE 107: The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of household
LINE 108: concerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning: after lunch I
LINE 109: got my drawing, and from dinner till bed-time I read. Meanwhile, poor
LINE 110: Arthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his
LINE 111: time. He wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as I did. Had the
LINE 112: weather at all permitted, he would doubtless have ordered his horse and
LINE 113: set off to some distant region, no matter where, immediately after
LINE 114: breakfast, and not returned till night: had there been a lady anywhere
LINE 115: within reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have
LINE 116: sought revenge and found employment in getting up, or trying to get up,
LINE 117: a desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction,
LINE 118: entirely cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings
LINE 119: were truly deplorable. When he had done yawning over his paper and
LINE 120: scribbling short answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder
LINE 121: of the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from
LINE 122: room to room, watching the clouds, cursing the rain, alternately
LINE 123: petting and teasing and abusing his dogs, sometimes lounging on the
LINE 124: sofa with a book that he could not force himself to read, and very
LINE 125: often fixedly gazing at me when he thought I did not perceive it, with
LINE 126: the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, or some tokens of
LINE 127: remorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to preserve an undisturbed
LINE 128: though grave serenity throughout the day. I was not really angry: I
LINE 129: felt for him all the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I
LINE 130: determined he should make the first advances, or at least show some
LINE 131: signs of an humble and contrite spirit first; for, if I began, it would
LINE 132: only minister to his self-conceit, increase his arrogance, and quite
LINE 133: destroy the lesson I wanted to give him.
LINE 134: He made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, took
LINE 135: an unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue: for
LINE 136: when he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy to
LINE 137: lift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured an expression of
LINE 138: suppressed disapprobation, and, shutting the door with a bang, went and
LINE 139: stretched himself at full length on the sofa, and composed himself to
LINE 140: sleep. But his favourite cocker, Dash, that had been lying at my feet,
LINE 141: took the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face. He
LINE 142: struck it off with a smart blow, and the poor dog squeaked and ran
LINE 143: cowering back to me. When he woke up, about half an hour after, he
LINE 144: called it to him again, but Dash only looked sheepish and wagged the
LINE 145: tip of his tail. He called again more sharply, but Dash only clung the
LINE 146: closer to me, and licked my hand, as if imploring protection. Enraged
LINE 147: at this, his master snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head.
LINE 148: The poor dog set up a piteous outcry, and ran to the door. I let him
LINE 149: out, and then quietly took up the book.
LINE 150: "Give that book to me," said Arthur, in no very courteous tone. I gave
LINE 151: it to him.
LINE 152: "Why did you let the dog out?" he asked; "you knew I wanted him."
LINE 153: "By what token?" I replied; "by your throwing the book at him? but
LINE 154: perhaps it was intended for me?"
LINE 155: "No; but I see you've got a taste of it," said he, looking at my hand,
LINE 156: that had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed.
LINE 157: I returned to my reading, and he endeavoured to occupy himself in the
LINE 158: same manner; but in a little while, after several portentous yawns, he
LINE 159: pronounced _his_ book to be "cursed trash," and threw it on the table.
LINE 160: Then followed eight or ten minutes of silence, during the greater part
LINE 161: of which, I believe, he was staring at me. At last his patience was
LINE 162: tired out.
LINE 163: "What _is_ that book, Helen?" he exclaimed.
LINE 164: I told him.
LINE 165: "Is it interesting?"
LINE 166: "Yes, very."
LINE 167: I went on reading, or pretending to read, at least—I cannot say there
LINE 168: was much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, while the
LINE 169: former ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly wondering when
LINE 170: Arthur would speak next, and what he would say, and what I should
LINE 171: answer. But he did not speak again till I rose to make the tea, and
LINE 172: then it was only to say he should not take any. He continued lounging
LINE 173: on the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch
LINE 174: and at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired.
LINE 175: "Helen!" cried he, the moment I had left the room. I turned back, and
LINE 176: stood awaiting his commands.
LINE 177: "What do you want, Arthur?" I said at length.
LINE 178: "Nothing," replied he. "Go!"
LINE 179: I went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the door, I
LINE 180: turned again. It sounded very like "confounded slut," but I was quite
LINE 181: willing it should be something else.
LINE 182: "Were you speaking, Arthur?" I asked.
LINE 183: "No," was the answer, and I shut the door and departed. I saw nothing
LINE 184: more of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he came down
LINE 185: a full hour after the usual time.
LINE 186: "You're very late," was my morning's salutation.
LINE 187: "You needn't have waited for me," was his; and he walked up to the
LINE 188: window again. It was just such weather as yesterday.
LINE 189: "Oh, this confounded rain!" he muttered. But, after studiously
LINE 190: regarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea, seemed to strike him,
LINE 191: for he suddenly exclaimed, "But I know what I'll do!" and then returned
LINE 192: and took his seat at the table. The letter-bag was already there,
LINE 193: waiting to be opened. He unlocked it and examined the contents, but
LINE 194: said nothing about them.
LINE 195: "Is there anything for me?" I asked.
LINE 196: "No."
LINE 197: He opened the newspaper and began to read.
LINE 198: "You'd better take your coffee," suggested I; "it will be cold again."
LINE 199: "You may go," said he, "if you've done; I don't want you."
LINE 200: I rose and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to have
LINE 201: another such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for an
LINE 202: end of these mutually inflicted torments. Shortly after I heard him
LINE 203: ring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as
LINE 204: if he meditated a long journey. He then sent for the coachman, and I
LINE 205: heard something about the carriage and the horses, and London, and
LINE 206: seven o'clock to-morrow morning, that startled and disturbed me not a
LINE 207: little.
LINE 208: "I must not let him go to London, whatever comes of it," said I to
LINE 209: myself; "he will run into all kinds of mischief, and I shall be the
LINE 210: cause of it. But the question is, How am I to alter his purpose? Well,
LINE 211: I will wait awhile, and see if he mentions it."
LINE 212: I waited most anxiously, from hour to hour; but not a word was spoken,
LINE 213: on that or any other subject, to me. He whistled and talked to his
LINE 214: dogs, and wandered from room to room, much the same as on the previous
LINE 215: day. At last I began to think I must introduce the subject myself, and
LINE 216: was pondering how to bring it about, when John unwittingly came to my
LINE 217: relief with the following message from the coachman:
LINE 218: "Please, sir, Richard says one of the horses has got a very bad cold,
LINE 219: and he thinks, sir, if you could make it convenient to go the day after
LINE 220: to-morrow, instead of to-morrow, he could physic it to-day, so as—"
LINE 221: "Confound his impudence!" interjected the master.
LINE 222: "Please, sir, he says it would be a deal better if you could,"
LINE 223: persisted John, "for he hopes there'll be a change in the weather
LINE 224: shortly, and he says it's not _likely_, when a horse is so bad with a
LINE 225: cold, and physicked and all—"
LINE 226: "Devil take the horse!" cried the gentleman. "Well, tell him I'll think
LINE 227: about it," he added, after a moment's reflection. He cast a searching
LINE 228: glance at me, as the servant withdrew, expecting to see some token of
LINE 229: deep astonishment and alarm; but, being previously prepared, I
LINE 230: preserved an aspect of stoical indifference. His countenance fell as he
LINE 231: met my steady gaze, and he turned away in very obvious disappointment,
LINE 232: and walked up to the fire-place, where he stood in an attitude of
LINE 233: undisguised dejection, leaning against the chimney-piece with his
LINE 234: forehead sunk upon his arm.
LINE 235: "Where do you want to go, Arthur?" said I.
LINE 236: "To London," replied he, gravely.
LINE 237: "What for?" I asked.
LINE 238: "Because I cannot be happy here."
LINE 239: "Why not?"
LINE 240: "Because my wife doesn't love me."
LINE 241: "She would love you with all her heart, if you deserved it."
LINE 242: "What must I do to deserve it?"
LINE 243: This seemed humble and earnest enough; and I was so much affected,
LINE 244: between sorrow and joy, that I was obliged to pause a few seconds
LINE 245: before I could steady my voice to reply.
LINE 246: "If she gives you her heart," said I, "you must take it, thankfully,
LINE 247: and use it well, and not pull it in pieces, and laugh in her face,
LINE 248: because she cannot snatch it away."
LINE 249: He now turned round, and stood facing me, with his back to the fire.
LINE 250: "Come, then, Helen, are you going to be a good girl?" said he.
LINE 251: This sounded rather too arrogant, and the smile that accompanied it did
LINE 252: not please me. I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former answer
LINE 253: had implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have seen
LINE 254: me brush away a tear.
LINE 255: "Are you going to forgive me, Helen?" he resumed, more humbly.
LINE 256: "Are _you_ penitent?" I replied, stepping up to him and smiling in his
LINE 257: face.
LINE 258: "Heart-broken!" he answered, with a rueful countenance, yet with a
LINE 259: merry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of his
LINE 260: mouth; but this could not repulse me, and I flew into his arms. He
LINE 261: fervently embraced me, and though I shed a torrent of tears, I think I
LINE 262: never was happier in my life than at that moment.
LINE 263: "Then you won't go to London, Arthur?" I said, when the first transport
LINE 264: of tears and kisses had subsided.
LINE 265: "No, love,—unless you will go with me."
LINE 266: "I will, gladly," I answered, "if you think the change will amuse you,
LINE 267: and if you will put off the journey till next week."
LINE 268: He readily consented, but said there was no need of much preparation,
LINE 269: as he should not be for staying long, for he did not wish me to be
LINE 270: Londonized, and to lose my country freshness and originality by too
LINE 271: much intercourse with the ladies of the world. I thought this folly;
LINE 272: but I did not wish to contradict him now: I merely said that I was of
LINE 273: very domestic habits, as he well knew, and had no particular wish to
LINE 274: mingle with the world.
LINE 275: So we are to go to London on Monday, the day after to-morrow. It is now
LINE 276: four days since the termination of our quarrel, and I am sure it has
LINE 277: done us both good: it has made me like Arthur a great deal better, and
LINE 278: made him behave a great deal better to me. He has never once attempted
LINE 279: to annoy me since, by the most distant allusion to Lady F——, or any of
LINE 280: those disagreeable reminiscences of his former life. I wish I could
LINE 281: blot them from my memory, or else get him to regard such matters in the
LINE 282: same light as I do. Well! it is something, however, to have made him
LINE 283: see that they are not fit subjects for a conjugal jest. He may see
LINE 284: further some time. I will put no limits to my hopes; and, in spite of
LINE 285: my aunt's forebodings and my own unspoken fears, I trust we shall be
LINE 286: happy yet.
