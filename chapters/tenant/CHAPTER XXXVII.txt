LINE 1: December 20th, 1825.—Another year is past; and I am weary of this life.
LINE 2: And yet I cannot wish to leave it: whatever afflictions assail me here,
LINE 3: I cannot wish to go and leave my darling in this dark and wicked world
LINE 4: alone, without a friend to guide him through its weary mazes, to warn
LINE 5: him of its thousand snares, and guard him from the perils that beset
LINE 6: him on every hand. I am not well fitted to be his only companion, I
LINE 7: know; but there is no other to supply my place. I am too grave to
LINE 8: minister to his amusements and enter into his infantile sports as a
LINE 9: nurse or a mother ought to do, and often his bursts of gleeful
LINE 10: merriment trouble and alarm me; I see in them his father's spirit and
LINE 11: temperament, and I tremble for the consequences; and too often damp the
LINE 12: innocent mirth I ought to share. That father, on the contrary, has no
LINE 13: weight of sadness on his mind; is troubled with no fears, no scruples
LINE 14: concerning his son's future welfare; and at evenings especially, the
LINE 15: times when the child sees him the most and the oftenest, he is always
LINE 16: particularly jocund and open-hearted: ready to laugh and to jest with
LINE 17: anything or anybody but me, and I am particularly silent and sad:
LINE 18: therefore, of course, the child dotes upon his seemingly joyous
LINE 19: amusing, ever-indulgent papa, and will at any time gladly exchange my
LINE 20: company for his. This disturbs me greatly; not so much for the sake of
LINE 21: my son's affection (though I do prize that highly, and though I feel it
LINE 22: is my right, and know I have done much to earn it) as for that
LINE 23: influence over him which, for his own advantage, I would strive to
LINE 24: purchase and retain, and which for very spite his father delights to
LINE 25: rob me of, and, from motives of mere idle egotism, is pleased to win to
LINE 26: himself; making no use of it but to torment me and ruin the child. My
LINE 27: only consolation is, that he spends comparatively little of his time at
LINE 28: home, and, during the months he passes in London or elsewhere, I have a
LINE 29: chance of recovering the ground I had lost, and overcoming with good
LINE 30: the evil he has wrought by his wilful mismanagement. But then it is a
LINE 31: bitter trial to behold him, on his return, doing his utmost to subvert
LINE 32: my labours and transform my innocent, affectionate, tractable darling
LINE 33: into a selfish, disobedient, and mischievous boy; thereby preparing the
LINE 34: soil for those vices he has so successfully cultivated in his own
LINE 35: perverted nature.
LINE 36: Happily, there were none of Arthur's "friends" invited to Grassdale
LINE 37: last autumn: he took himself off to visit some of them instead. I wish
LINE 38: he would always do so, and I wish his friends were numerous and loving
LINE 39: enough to keep him amongst them all the year round. Mr. Hargrave,
LINE 40: considerably to my annoyance, did not go with him; but I think I have
LINE 41: done with that gentleman at last.
LINE 42: For seven or eight months he behaved so remarkably well, and managed so
LINE 43: skilfully too, that I was almost completely off my guard, and was
LINE 44: really beginning to look upon him as a friend, and even to treat him as
LINE 45: such, with certain prudent restrictions (which I deemed scarcely
LINE 46: necessary); when, presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness, he thought
LINE 47: he might venture to overstep the bounds of decent moderation and
LINE 48: propriety that had so long restrained him. It was on a pleasant evening
LINE 49: at the close of May: I was wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me
LINE 50: there as he rode past, made bold to enter and approach me, dismounting
LINE 51: and leaving his horse at the gate. This was the first time he had
LINE 52: ventured to come within its inclosure since I had been left alone,
LINE 53: without the sanction of his mother's or sister's company, or at least
LINE 54: the excuse of a message from them. But he managed to appear so calm and
LINE 55: easy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness, that,
LINE 56: though a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the
LINE 57: unusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash-trees and by the
LINE 58: water-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and
LINE 59: intelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting
LINE 60: rid of him. Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on
LINE 61: the calm, blue water—I revolving in my mind the best means of politely
LINE 62: dismissing my companion, he, no doubt, pondering other matters equally
LINE 63: alien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his
LINE 64: senses,—he suddenly electrified me by beginning, in a peculiar tone,
LINE 65: low, soft, but perfectly distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal
LINE 66: expressions of earnest and passionate love; pleading his cause with all
LINE 67: the bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid. But I cut
LINE 68: short his appeal, and repulsed him so determinately, so decidedly, and
LINE 69: with such a mixture of scornful indignation, tempered with cool,
LINE 70: dispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind, that he withdrew,
LINE 71: astonished, mortified, and discomforted; and, a few days after, I heard
LINE 72: that he had departed for London. He returned, however, in eight or nine
LINE 73: weeks, and did not entirely keep aloof from me, but comported himself
LINE 74: in so remarkable a manner that his quick-sighted sister could not fail
LINE 75: to notice the change.
LINE 76: "What have you done to Walter, Mrs. Huntingdon?" said she one morning,
LINE 77: when I had called at the Grove, and he had just left the room after
LINE 78: exchanging a few words of the coldest civility. "He has been so
LINE 79: extremely ceremonious and stately of late, I can't imagine what it is
LINE 80: all about, unless you have desperately offended him. Tell me what it
LINE 81: is, that I may be your mediator, and make you friends again."
LINE 82: "I have done nothing willingly to offend him," said I. "If he is
LINE 83: offended, he can best tell you himself what it is about."
LINE 84: "I'll ask him," cried the giddy girl, springing up and putting her head
LINE 85: out of the window: "he's only in the garden—Walter!"
LINE 86: "No, no, Esther! you will seriously displease me if you do; and I shall
LINE 87: leave you immediately, and not come again for months—perhaps years."
LINE 88: "Did you call, Esther?" said her brother, approaching the window from
LINE 89: without.
LINE 90: "Yes; I wanted to ask you—"
LINE 91: "Good-morning, Esther," said I, taking her hand and giving it a severe
LINE 92: squeeze.
LINE 93: "To ask you," continued she, "to get me a rose for Mrs. Huntingdon." He
LINE 94: departed. "Mrs. Huntingdon," she exclaimed, turning to me and still
LINE 95: holding me fast by the hand, "I'm quite shocked at you—you're just as
LINE 96: angry, and distant, and cold as he is: and I'm determined you shall be
LINE 97: as good friends as ever before you go."
LINE 98: "Esther, how can you be so rude!" cried Mrs. Hargrave, who was seated
LINE 99: gravely knitting in her easy-chair. "Surely, you never _will_ learn to
LINE 100: conduct yourself like a lady!"
LINE 101: "Well, mamma, you said yourself—" But the young lady was silenced by
LINE 102: the uplifted finger of her mamma, accompanied with a very stern shake
LINE 103: of the head.
LINE 104: "Isn't she cross?" whispered she to me; but, before I could add my
LINE 105: share of reproof, Mr. Hargrave reappeared at the window with a
LINE 106: beautiful moss-rose in his hand.
LINE 107: "Here, Esther, I've brought you the rose," said he, extending it
LINE 108: towards her.
LINE 109: "Give it her yourself, you blockhead!" cried she, recoiling with a
LINE 110: spring from between us.
LINE 111: "Mrs. Huntingdon would rather receive it from you," replied he, in a
LINE 112: very serious tone, but lowering his voice that his mother might not
LINE 113: hear. His sister took the rose and gave it to me.
LINE 114: "My brother's compliments, Mrs. Huntingdon, and he hopes you and he
LINE 115: will come to a better understanding by-and-by. Will that do, Walter?"
LINE 116: added the saucy girl, turning to him and putting her arm round his
LINE 117: neck, as he stood leaning upon the sill of the window—"or should I have
LINE 118: said that you are sorry you were so touchy? or that you hope she will
LINE 119: pardon your offence?"
LINE 120: "You silly girl! you don't know what you are talking about," replied he
LINE 121: gravely.
LINE 122: "Indeed I don't: for I'm quite in the dark!"
LINE 123: "Now, Esther," interposed Mrs. Hargrave, who, if equally benighted on
LINE 124: the subject of our estrangement, saw at least that her daughter was
LINE 125: behaving very improperly, "I must insist upon your leaving the room!"
LINE 126: "Pray don't, Mrs. Hargrave, for I'm going to leave it myself," said I,
LINE 127: and immediately made my adieux.
LINE 128: About a week after Mr. Hargrave brought his sister to see me. He
LINE 129: conducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant,
LINE 130: half-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but Esther made
LINE 131: no remark upon it this time: she had evidently been schooled into
LINE 132: better manners. She talked to me, and laughed and romped with little
LINE 133: Arthur, her loved and loving playmate. He, somewhat to my discomfort,
LINE 134: enticed her from the room to have a run in the hall, and thence into
LINE 135: the garden. I got up to stir the fire. Mr. Hargrave asked if I felt
LINE 136: cold, and shut the door—a very unseasonable piece of officiousness, for
LINE 137: I had meditated following the noisy playfellows if they did not
LINE 138: speedily return. He then took the liberty of walking up to the fire
LINE 139: himself, and asking me if I were aware that Mr. Huntingdon was now at
LINE 140: the seat of Lord Lowborough, and likely to continue there some time.
LINE 141: "No; but it's no matter," I answered carelessly; and if my cheek glowed
LINE 142: like fire, it was rather at the question than the information it
LINE 143: conveyed.
LINE 144: "You don't object to it?" he said.
LINE 145: "Not at all, if Lord Lowborough likes his company."
LINE 146: "You have no love left for him, then?"
LINE 147: "Not the least."
LINE 148: "I knew that—I knew you were too high-minded and pure in your own
LINE 149: nature to continue to regard one so utterly false and polluted with any
LINE 150: feelings but those of indignation and scornful abhorrence!"
LINE 151: "Is he not your friend?" said I, turning my eyes from the fire to his
LINE 152: face, with perhaps a slight touch of those feelings he assigned to
LINE 153: another.
LINE 154: "He _was_," replied he, with the same calm gravity as before; "but do
LINE 155: not wrong me by supposing that I could continue my friendship and
LINE 156: esteem to a man who could so infamously, so impiously forsake and
LINE 157: injure one so transcendently—well, I won't speak of it. But tell me, do
LINE 158: you never think of revenge?"
LINE 159: "Revenge! No—what good would that do?—it would make him no better, and
LINE 160: me no happier."
LINE 161: "I don't know how to talk to you, Mrs. Huntingdon," said he, smiling;
LINE 162: "you are only half a woman—your nature must be half human, half
LINE 163: angelic. Such goodness overawes me; I don't know what to make of it."
LINE 164: "Then, sir, I fear you must be very much worse than you should be, if
LINE 165: I, a mere ordinary mortal, am, by your own confession, so vastly your
LINE 166: superior; and since there exists so little sympathy between us, I think
LINE 167: we had better each look out for some more congenial companion." And
LINE 168: forthwith moving to the window, I began to look out for my little son
LINE 169: and his gay young friend.
LINE 170: "No, _I_ am the ordinary mortal, I maintain," replied Mr. Hargrave. "I
LINE 171: will not allow myself to be worse than my fellows; but _you_, Madam—I
LINE 172: equally maintain there is nobody like you. But are you happy?" he asked
LINE 173: in a serious tone.
LINE 174: "As happy as some others, I suppose."
LINE 175: "Are you as happy as you desire to be?"
LINE 176: "No one is so blest as that comes to on this side of eternity."
LINE 177: "One thing I know," returned he, with a deep sad sigh; "you are
LINE 178: immeasurably happier than I am."
LINE 179: "I am very sorry for you, then," I could not help replying.
LINE 180: "Are you, _indeed?_ No, for if you were you would be glad to relieve
LINE 181: me."
LINE 182: "And so I should if I could do so without injuring myself or any
LINE 183: other."
LINE 184: "And can you suppose that I should wish you to injure yourself? No: on
LINE 185: the contrary, it is your own happiness I long for more than mine. You
LINE 186: are miserable now, Mrs. Huntingdon," continued he, looking me boldly in
LINE 187: the face. "You do not complain, but I see—and feel—and know that you
LINE 188: are miserable—and must remain so as long as you keep those walls of
LINE 189: impenetrable ice about your still warm and palpitating heart; and I am
LINE 190: miserable, too. Deign to smile on me and I am happy: trust me, and you
LINE 191: shall be happy also, for if you _are_ a woman I can make you so—and I
LINE 192: _will_ do it in spite of yourself!" he muttered between his teeth; "and
LINE 193: as for others, the question is between ourselves alone: you cannot
LINE 194: injure your husband, you know, and no one else has any concern in the
LINE 195: matter."
LINE 196: "I have a son, Mr. Hargrave, and you have a mother," said I, retiring
LINE 197: from the window, whither he had followed me.
LINE 198: "They need not know," he began; but before anything more could be said
LINE 199: on either side, Esther and Arthur re-entered the room. The former
LINE 200: glanced at Walter's flushed, excited countenance, and then at mine—a
LINE 201: little flushed and excited too, I daresay, though from far different
LINE 202: causes. She must have thought we had been quarrelling desperately, and
LINE 203: was evidently perplexed and disturbed at the circumstance; but she was
LINE 204: too polite or too much afraid of her brother's anger to refer to it.
LINE 205: She seated herself on the sofa, and putting back her bright, golden
LINE 206: ringlets, that were scattered in wild profusion over her face, she
LINE 207: immediately began to talk about the garden and her little playfellow,
LINE 208: and continued to chatter away in her usual strain till her brother
LINE 209: summoned her to depart.
LINE 210: "If I have spoken too warmly, forgive me," he murmured on taking his
LINE 211: leave, "or I shall never forgive myself." Esther smiled and glanced at
LINE 212: me: I merely bowed, and her countenance fell. She thought it a poor
LINE 213: return for Walter's generous concession, and was disappointed in her
LINE 214: friend. Poor child, she little knows the world she lives in!
LINE 215: Mr. Hargrave had not an opportunity of meeting me again in private for
LINE 216: several weeks after this; but when he did meet me there was less of
LINE 217: pride and more of touching melancholy in his manner than before. Oh,
LINE 218: _how_ he annoyed me! I was obliged at last almost entirely to remit my
LINE 219: visits to the Grove, at the expense of deeply offending Mrs. Hargrave
LINE 220: and seriously afflicting poor Esther, who really values my society for
LINE 221: want of better, and who ought not to suffer for the fault of her
LINE 222: brother. But that indefatigable foe was not yet vanquished: he seemed
LINE 223: to be always on the watch. I frequently saw him riding lingeringly past
LINE 224: the premises, looking searchingly round him as he went—or, if _I_ did
LINE 225: not, Rachel did. That sharp-sighted woman soon guessed how matters
LINE 226: stood between us, and descrying the enemy's movements from her
LINE 227: elevation at the nursery-window, she would give me a quiet intimation
LINE 228: if she saw me preparing for a walk when she had reason to believe he
LINE 229: was about, or to think it likely that he would meet or overtake me in
LINE 230: the way I meant to traverse. I would then defer my ramble, or confine
LINE 231: myself for that day to the park and gardens, or, if the proposed
LINE 232: excursion was a matter of importance, such as a visit to the sick or
LINE 233: afflicted, I would take Rachel with me, and then I was never molested.
LINE 234: But one mild, sunshiny day, early in November, I had ventured forth
LINE 235: alone to visit the village school and a few of the poor tenants, and on
LINE 236: my return I was alarmed at the clatter of a horse's feet behind me,
LINE 237: approaching at a rapid, steady trot. There was no stile or gap at hand
LINE 238: by which I could escape into the fields, so I walked quietly on, saying
LINE 239: to myself, "It may not be he after all; and if it is, and if he _do_
LINE 240: annoy me, it shall be for the last time, I am determined, if there be
LINE 241: power in words and looks against cool impudence and mawkish
LINE 242: sentimentality so inexhaustible as his."
LINE 243: The horse soon overtook me, and was reined up close beside me. It _was_
LINE 244: Mr. Hargrave. He greeted me with a smile intended to be soft and
LINE 245: melancholy, but his triumphant satisfaction at having caught me at last
LINE 246: so shone through that it was quite a failure. After briefly answering
LINE 247: his salutation and inquiring after the ladies at the Grove, I turned
LINE 248: away and walked on; but he followed and kept his horse at my side: it
LINE 249: was evident he intended to be my companion all the way.
LINE 250: "Well! I don't much care. If you want another rebuff, take it—and
LINE 251: welcome," was my inward remark. "Now, sir, what next?"
LINE 252: This question, though unspoken, was not long unanswered; after a few
LINE 253: passing observations upon indifferent subjects, he began in solemn
LINE 254: tones the following appeal to my humanity:—
LINE 255: "It will be four years next April since I first saw you, Mrs.
LINE 256: Huntingdon—_you_ may have forgotten the circumstance, but _I_ never
LINE 257: can. I admired you then most deeply, but I dared not love you. In the
LINE 258: following autumn I saw so much of your perfections that I could not
LINE 259: fail to love you, though I dared not show it. For upwards of three
LINE 260: years I have endured a perfect martyrdom. From the anguish of
LINE 261: suppressed emotions, intense and fruitless longings, silent sorrow,
LINE 262: crushed hopes, and trampled affections, I have suffered more than I can
LINE 263: tell, or you imagine—and you were the cause of it, and not altogether
LINE 264: the innocent cause. My youth is wasting away; my prospects are
LINE 265: darkened; my life is a desolate blank; I have no rest day or night: I
LINE 266: am become a burden to myself and others, and you might save me by a
LINE 267: word—a glance, and will not do it—is this right?"
LINE 268: "In the first place, _I_ don't believe _you_," answered I; "in the
LINE 269: second, if you will be such a fool, I can't hinder it."
LINE 270: "If you affect," replied he, earnestly, "to regard as folly the best,
LINE 271: the strongest, the most godlike impulses of our nature, I don't believe
LINE 272: you. I know you are not the heartless, icy being you pretend to be—you
LINE 273: had a heart once, and gave it to your husband. When you found him
LINE 274: utterly unworthy of the treasure, you reclaimed it; and you will not
LINE 275: _pretend_ that you loved that sensual, earthly-minded profligate so
LINE 276: deeply, so devotedly, that you can never love another? I know that
LINE 277: there are feelings in your nature that have never yet been called
LINE 278: forth; I know, too, that in your present neglected lonely state you are
LINE 279: and _must_ be miserable. You have it in your power to raise two human
LINE 280: beings from a state of actual suffering to such unspeakable beatitude
LINE 281: as only generous, noble, self-forgetting love can give (for you _can_
LINE 282: love me if you will); you may tell me that you scorn and detest me,
LINE 283: but, since you have set me the example of plain speaking, I will answer
LINE 284: that _I do not believe you!_ But you will not do it! you choose rather
LINE 285: to leave us miserable; and you coolly tell me it is the will of God
LINE 286: that we should remain so. _You_ may call this religion, but _I_ call it
LINE 287: wild fanaticism!"
LINE 288: "There is another life both for you and for me," said I. "If it be the
LINE 289: will of God that we should sow in tears now, it is only that we may
LINE 290: reap in joy hereafter. It is His will that we should not injure others
LINE 291: by the gratification of our own earthly passions; and you have a
LINE 292: mother, and sisters, and friends who would be seriously injured by your
LINE 293: disgrace; and I, too, have friends, whose peace of mind shall never be
LINE 294: sacrificed to my enjoyment, or yours either, with my consent; and if I
LINE 295: were alone in the world, I have still my God and my religion, and I
LINE 296: would sooner die than disgrace my calling and break my faith with
LINE 297: heaven to obtain a few brief years of false and fleeting
LINE 298: happiness—happiness sure to end in misery even here—for myself or any
LINE 299: other!"
LINE 300: "There need be no disgrace, no misery or sacrifice in any quarter,"
LINE 301: persisted he. "I do not ask you to leave your home or defy the world's
LINE 302: opinion." But I need not repeat all his arguments. I refuted them to
LINE 303: the best of my power; but that power was provokingly small, at the
LINE 304: moment, for I was too much flurried with indignation—and even
LINE 305: shame—that he should thus dare to address me, to retain sufficient
LINE 306: command of thought and language to enable me adequately to contend
LINE 307: against his powerful sophistries. Finding, however, that he could not
LINE 308: be silenced by reason, and even covertly exulted in his seeming
LINE 309: advantage, and ventured to deride those assertions I had not the
LINE 310: coolness to prove, I changed my course and tried another plan.
LINE 311: "Do you really love me?" said I, seriously, pausing and looking him
LINE 312: calmly in the face.
LINE 313: "Do I love you!" cried he.
LINE 314: "_Truly?_" I demanded.
LINE 315: His countenance brightened; he thought his triumph was at hand. He
LINE 316: commenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his
LINE 317: attachment, which I cut short by another question:—
LINE 318: "But is it not a selfish love? Have you enough disinterested affection
LINE 319: to enable you to sacrifice your own pleasure to mine?"
LINE 320: "I would give my life to serve you."
LINE 321: "I don't want your life; but have you enough real sympathy for my
LINE 322: afflictions to induce you to make an effort to relieve them, at the
LINE 323: risk of a little discomfort to yourself?"
LINE 324: "Try me, and see."
LINE 325: "If you have, _never mention this subject again_. You cannot recur to
LINE 326: it in any way without doubling the weight of those sufferings you so
LINE 327: feelingly deplore. I have nothing left me but the solace of a good
LINE 328: conscience and a hopeful trust in heaven, and you labour continually to
LINE 329: rob me of these. If you persist, I must regard you as my deadliest
LINE 330: foe."
LINE 331: "But hear me a moment—"
LINE 332: "No, sir! You said you would give your life to serve me; I only ask
LINE 333: your _silence_ on one particular point. I have spoken plainly; and what
LINE 334: I say I mean. If you torment me in this way any more, I must conclude
LINE 335: that your protestations are entirely false, and that you hate me in
LINE 336: your heart as fervently as you profess to love me!"
LINE 337: He bit his lip, and bent his eyes upon the ground in silence for a
LINE 338: while.
LINE 339: "Then I must leave you," said he at length, looking steadily upon me,
LINE 340: as if with the last hope of detecting some token of irrepressible
LINE 341: anguish or dismay awakened by those solemn words. "I must leave you. I
LINE 342: cannot live here, and be for ever silent on the all-absorbing subject
LINE 343: of my thoughts and wishes."
LINE 344: "Formerly, I believe, you spent but little of your time at home," I
LINE 345: answered; "it will do you no harm to absent yourself again, for a
LINE 346: while—if that be really necessary."
LINE 347: "If that be really _possible_," he muttered; "and can you bid me go so
LINE 348: coolly? Do you really wish it?"
LINE 349: "Most certainly I do. If you cannot see me without tormenting me as you
LINE 350: have lately done, I would gladly say farewell and never see you more."
LINE 351: He made no answer, but, bending from his horse, held out his hand
LINE 352: towards me. I looked up at his face, and saw therein such a look of
LINE 353: genuine agony of soul, that, whether bitter disappointment, or wounded
LINE 354: pride, or lingering love, or burning wrath were uppermost, I could not
LINE 355: hesitate to put my hand in his as frankly as if I bade a friend
LINE 356: farewell. He grasped it very hard, and immediately put spurs to his
LINE 357: horse and galloped away. Very soon after, I learned that he was gone to
LINE 358: Paris, where he still is; and the longer he stays there the better for
LINE 359: me.
LINE 360: I thank God for this deliverance!
