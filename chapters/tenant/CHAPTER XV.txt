LINE 1: That day was rainy like its predecessor; but towards evening it began
LINE 2: to clear up a little, and the next morning was fair and promising. I
LINE 3: was out on the hill with the reapers. A light wind swept over the corn,
LINE 4: and all nature laughed in the sunshine. The lark was rejoicing among
LINE 5: the silvery floating clouds. The late rain had so sweetly freshened and
LINE 6: cleared the air, and washed the sky, and left such glittering gems on
LINE 7: branch and blade, that not even the farmers could have the heart to
LINE 8: blame it. But no ray of sunshine could reach my heart, no breeze could
LINE 9: freshen it; nothing could fill the void my faith, and hope, and joy in
LINE 10: Helen Graham had left, or drive away the keen regrets and bitter dregs
LINE 11: of lingering love that still oppressed it.
LINE 12: While I stood with folded arms abstractedly gazing on the undulating
LINE 13: swell of the corn, not yet disturbed by the reapers, something gently
LINE 14: pulled my skirts, and a small voice, no longer welcome to my ears,
LINE 15: aroused me with the startling words,—"Mr. Markham, mamma wants you."
LINE 16: "Wants _me_, Arthur?"
LINE 17: "Yes. Why do you look so queer?" said he, half laughing, half
LINE 18: frightened at the unexpected aspect of my face in suddenly turning
LINE 19: towards him,—"and why have you kept so long away? Come! Won't you
LINE 20: come?"
LINE 21: "I'm busy just now," I replied, scarce knowing what to answer.
LINE 22: He looked up in childish bewilderment; but before I could speak again
LINE 23: the lady herself was at my side.
LINE 24: "Gilbert, I _must_ speak with you!" said she, in a tone of suppressed
LINE 25: vehemence.
LINE 26: I looked at her pale cheek and glittering eye, but answered nothing.
LINE 27: "Only for a moment," pleaded she. "Just step aside into this other
LINE 28: field." She glanced at the reapers, some of whom were directing looks
LINE 29: of impertinent curiosity towards her. "I won't keep you a minute."
LINE 30: I accompanied her through the gap.
LINE 31: "Arthur, darling, run and gather those bluebells," said she, pointing
LINE 32: to some that were gleaming at some distance under the hedge along which
LINE 33: we walked. The child hesitated, as if unwilling to quit my side. "Go,
LINE 34: love!" repeated she more urgently, and in a tone which, though not
LINE 35: unkind, demanded prompt obedience, and obtained it.
LINE 36: "Well, Mrs. Graham?" said I, calmly and coldly; for, though I saw she
LINE 37: was miserable, and pitied her, I felt glad to have it in my power to
LINE 38: torment her.
LINE 39: She fixed her eyes upon me with a look that pierced me to the heart;
LINE 40: and yet it made me smile.
LINE 41: "I don't ask the reason of this change, Gilbert," said she, with bitter
LINE 42: calmness: "I know it too well; but though I could see myself suspected
LINE 43: and condemned by every one else, and bear it with calmness, I cannot
LINE 44: endure it from you.—Why did you not come to hear my explanation on the
LINE 45: day I appointed to give it?"
LINE 46: "Because I happened, in the interim, to learn all you would have told
LINE 47: me—and a trifle more, I imagine."
LINE 48: "Impossible, for I would have told you all!" cried she,
LINE 49: passionately—"but I won't now, for I see you are not worthy of it!"
LINE 50: And her pale lips quivered with agitation.
LINE 51: "Why not, may I ask?"
LINE 52: She repelled my mocking smile with a glance of scornful indignation.
LINE 53: "Because you never understood me, or you would not soon have listened
LINE 54: to my traducers—my confidence would be misplaced in you—you are not the
LINE 55: man I thought you. Go! I won't care _what_ you think of me."
LINE 56: She turned away, and I went; for I thought that would torment her as
LINE 57: much as anything; and I believe I was right; for, looking back a minute
LINE 58: after, I saw her turn half round, as if hoping or expecting to find me
LINE 59: still beside her; and then she stood still, and cast one look behind.
LINE 60: It was a look less expressive of anger than of bitter anguish and
LINE 61: despair; but I immediately assumed an aspect of indifference, and
LINE 62: affected to be gazing carelessly around me, and I suppose she went on;
LINE 63: for after lingering awhile to see if she would come back or call, I
LINE 64: ventured one more glance, and saw her a good way off, moving rapidly up
LINE 65: the field, with little Arthur running by her side and apparently
LINE 66: talking as he went; but she kept her face averted from him, as if to
LINE 67: hide some uncontrollable emotion. And I returned to my business.
LINE 68: But I soon began to regret my precipitancy in leaving her so soon. It
LINE 69: was evident she loved me—probably she was tired of Mr. Lawrence, and
LINE 70: wished to exchange him for me; and if I had loved and reverenced her
LINE 71: less to begin with, the preference might have gratified and amused me;
LINE 72: but now the contrast between her outward seeming and her inward mind,
LINE 73: as I supposed,—between my former and my present opinion of her, was so
LINE 74: harrowing—so distressing to my feelings, that it swallowed up every
LINE 75: lighter consideration.
LINE 76: But still I was curious to know what sort of an explanation she would
LINE 77: have given me—or would give now, if I pressed her for it—how much she
LINE 78: would confess, and how she would endeavour to excuse herself. I longed
LINE 79: to know what to despise, and what to admire in her; how much to pity,
LINE 80: and how much to hate;—and, what was more, I _would_ know. I would see
LINE 81: her once more, and fairly satisfy myself in what light to regard her,
LINE 82: before we parted. Lost to me she was, for ever, of course; but still I
LINE 83: could not bear to think that we had parted, for the last time, with so
LINE 84: much unkindness and misery on both sides. That last look of hers had
LINE 85: sunk into my heart; I could not forget it. But what a fool I was! Had
LINE 86: she not deceived me, injured me—blighted my happiness for life? "Well,
LINE 87: I'll see her, however," was my concluding resolve, "but not to-day:
LINE 88: to-day and to-night she may think upon her sins, and be as miserable as
LINE 89: she will: to-morrow I will see her once again, and know something more
LINE 90: about her. The interview may be serviceable to her, or it may not. At
LINE 91: any rate, it will give a breath of excitement to the life she has
LINE 92: doomed to stagnation, and may calm with certainty some agitating
LINE 93: thoughts."
LINE 94: I did go on the morrow, but not till towards evening, after the
LINE 95: business of the day was concluded, that is, between six and seven; and
LINE 96: the westering sun was gleaming redly on the old Hall, and flaming in
LINE 97: the latticed windows, as I reached it, imparting to the place a
LINE 98: cheerfulness not its own. I need not dilate upon the feelings with
LINE 99: which I approached the shrine of my former divinity—that spot teeming
LINE 100: with a thousand delightful recollections and glorious dreams—all
LINE 101: darkened now by one disastrous truth.
LINE 102: Rachel admitted me into the parlour, and went to call her mistress, for
LINE 103: she was not there: but there was her desk left open on the little round
LINE 104: table beside the high-backed chair, with a book laid upon it. Her
LINE 105: limited but choice collection of books was almost as familiar to me as
LINE 106: my own; but this volume I had not seen before. I took it up. It was Sir
LINE 107: Humphry Davy's "Last Days of a Philosopher," and on the first leaf was
LINE 108: written, "Frederick Lawrence." I closed the book, but kept it in my
LINE 109: hand, and stood facing the door, with my back to the fire-place, calmly
LINE 110: waiting her arrival; for I did not doubt she would come. And soon I
LINE 111: heard her step in the hall. My heart was beginning to throb, but I
LINE 112: checked it with an internal rebuke, and maintained my
LINE 113: composure—outwardly at least. She entered, calm, pale, collected.
LINE 114: "To what am I indebted for this favour, Mr. Markham?" said she, with
LINE 115: such severe but quiet dignity as almost disconcerted me; but I answered
LINE 116: with a smile, and impudently enough,—
LINE 117: "Well, I am come to hear your explanation."
LINE 118: "I told you I would not give it," said she. "I said you were unworthy
LINE 119: of my confidence."
LINE 120: "Oh, very well," replied I, moving to the door.
LINE 121: "Stay a moment," said she. "This is the last time I shall see you:
LINE 122: don't go just yet."
LINE 123: I remained, awaiting her further commands.
LINE 124: "Tell me," resumed she, "on what grounds you believe these things
LINE 125: against me; who told you; and what did they say?"
LINE 126: I paused a moment. She met my eye as unflinchingly as if her bosom had
LINE 127: been steeled with conscious innocence. She was resolved to know the
LINE 128: worst, and determined to dare it too. "I can crush that bold spirit,"
LINE 129: thought I. But while I secretly exulted in my power, I felt disposed to
LINE 130: dally with my victim like a cat. Showing her the book that I still
LINE 131: held, in my hand, and pointing to the name on the fly-leaf, but fixing
LINE 132: my eye upon her face, I asked,—"Do you know that gentleman?"
LINE 133: "Of course I do," replied she; and a sudden flush suffused her
LINE 134: features—whether of shame or anger I could not tell: it rather
LINE 135: resembled the latter. "What next, sir?"
LINE 136: "How long is it since you saw him?"
LINE 137: "Who gave you the right to catechize me on this or any other subject?"
LINE 138: "Oh, no one!—it's quite at your option whether to answer or not. And
LINE 139: now, let me ask—have you heard what has lately befallen this friend of
LINE 140: yours?—because, if you have not—"
LINE 141: "I will not be insulted, Mr. Markham!" cried she, almost infuriated at
LINE 142: my manner. "So you had better leave the house at once, if you came only
LINE 143: for that."
LINE 144: "I did not come to insult you: I came to hear your explanation."
LINE 145: "And I tell you I won't give it!" retorted she, pacing the room in a
LINE 146: state of strong excitement, with her hands clasped tightly together,
LINE 147: breathing short, and flashing fires of indignation from her eyes. "I
LINE 148: will not condescend to explain myself to one that can make a jest of
LINE 149: such horrible suspicions, and be so easily led to entertain them."
LINE 150: "I do not make a jest of them, Mrs. Graham," returned I, dropping at
LINE 151: once my tone of taunting sarcasm. "I heartily wish I could find them a
LINE 152: jesting matter. And as to being easily led to suspect, God only knows
LINE 153: what a blind, incredulous fool I have hitherto been, perseveringly
LINE 154: shutting my eyes and stopping my ears against everything that
LINE 155: threatened to shake my confidence in you, till proof itself confounded
LINE 156: my infatuation!"
LINE 157: "What proof, sir?"
LINE 158: "Well, I'll tell you. You remember that evening when I was here last?"
LINE 159: "I do."
LINE 160: "Even then you dropped some hints that might have opened the eyes of a
LINE 161: wiser man; but they had no such effect upon me: I went on trusting and
LINE 162: believing, hoping against hope, and adoring where I could not
LINE 163: comprehend. It so happened, however, that after I left you I turned
LINE 164: back—drawn by pure depth of sympathy and ardour of affection—not daring
LINE 165: to intrude my presence openly upon you, but unable to resist the
LINE 166: temptation of catching one glimpse through the window, just to see how
LINE 167: you were: for I had left you apparently in great affliction, and I
LINE 168: partly blamed my own want of forbearance and discretion as the cause of
LINE 169: it. If I did wrong, love alone was my incentive, and the punishment was
LINE 170: severe enough; for it was just as I had reached that tree, that you
LINE 171: came out into the garden with your friend. Not choosing to show myself,
LINE 172: under the circumstances, I stood still, in the shadow, till you had
LINE 173: both passed by."
LINE 174: "And how much of our conversation did you hear?"
LINE 175: "I heard quite enough, Helen. And it was well for me that I did hear
LINE 176: it; for nothing less could have cured my infatuation. I always said and
LINE 177: thought, that I would never believe a word against you, unless I heard
LINE 178: it from your own lips. All the hints and affirmations of others I
LINE 179: treated as malignant, baseless slanders; your own self-accusations I
LINE 180: believed to be overstrained; and all that seemed unaccountable in your
LINE 181: position I trusted that you could account for if you chose."
LINE 182: Mrs. Graham had discontinued her walk. She leant against one end of the
LINE 183: chimney-piece, opposite that near which I was standing, with her chin
LINE 184: resting on her closed hand, her eyes—no longer burning with anger, but
LINE 185: gleaming with restless excitement—sometimes glancing at me while I
LINE 186: spoke, then coursing the opposite wall, or fixed upon the carpet.
LINE 187: "You should have come to me after all," said she, "and heard what I had
LINE 188: to say in my own justification. It was ungenerous and wrong to withdraw
LINE 189: yourself so secretly and suddenly, immediately after such ardent
LINE 190: protestations of attachment, without ever assigning a reason for the
LINE 191: change. You should have told me all—no matter _how_ bitterly. It would
LINE 192: have been better than this silence."
LINE 193: "To what end should I have done so? You could not have enlightened me
LINE 194: further, on the subject which alone concerned me; nor could you have
LINE 195: made me discredit the evidence of my senses. I desired our intimacy to
LINE 196: be discontinued at once, as you yourself had acknowledged would
LINE 197: probably be the case if I knew all; but I did not wish to upbraid
LINE 198: you,—though (as you also acknowledged) you had deeply wronged me. Yes,
LINE 199: you have done me an injury you can never repair—or any other either—you
LINE 200: have blighted the freshness and promise of youth, and made my life a
LINE 201: wilderness! I might live a hundred years, but I could never recover
LINE 202: from the effects of this withering blow—and never forget it!
LINE 203: Hereafter—You smile, Mrs. Graham," said I, suddenly stopping short,
LINE 204: checked in my passionate declamation by unutterable feelings to behold
LINE 205: her actually _smiling_ at the picture of the ruin she had wrought.
LINE 206: "Did I?" replied she, looking seriously up; "I was not aware of it. If
LINE 207: I did, it was not for pleasure at the thoughts of the harm I had done
LINE 208: you. Heaven knows I have had torment enough at the bare possibility of
LINE 209: that; it was for joy to find that you had some depth of soul and
LINE 210: feeling after all, and to hope that I had not been utterly mistaken in
LINE 211: your worth. But smiles and tears are so alike with me, they are neither
LINE 212: of them confined to any particular feelings: I often cry when I am
LINE 213: happy, and smile when I am sad."
LINE 214: She looked at me again, and seemed to expect a reply; but I continued
LINE 215: silent.
LINE 216: "Would you be _very_ glad," resumed she, "to find that you were
LINE 217: mistaken in your conclusions?"
LINE 218: "How can you ask it, Helen?"
LINE 219: "I don't say I can clear myself altogether," said she, speaking low and
LINE 220: fast, while her heart beat visibly and her bosom heaved with
LINE 221: excitement,—"but would you be glad to discover I was better than you
LINE 222: think me?"
LINE 223: "Anything that could in the least degree tend to restore my former
LINE 224: opinion of you, to excuse the regard I still feel for you, and
LINE 225: alleviate the pangs of unutterable regret that accompany it, would be
LINE 226: only too gladly, too eagerly received!" Her cheeks burned, and her
LINE 227: whole frame trembled, now, with excess of agitation. She did not speak,
LINE 228: but flew to her desk, and snatching thence what seemed a thick album or
LINE 229: manuscript volume, hastily tore away a few leaves from the end, and
LINE 230: thrust the rest into my hand, saying, "You needn't read it all; but
LINE 231: take it home with you," and hurried from the room. But when I had left
LINE 232: the house, and was proceeding down the walk, she opened the window and
LINE 233: called me back. It was only to say,—"Bring it back when you have read
LINE 234: it; and don't breathe a word of what it tells you to any living being.
LINE 235: I trust to your honour."
LINE 236: Before I could answer she had closed the casement and turned away. I
LINE 237: saw her cast herself back in the old oak chair, and cover her face with
LINE 238: her hands. Her feelings had been wrought to a pitch that rendered it
LINE 239: necessary to seek relief in tears.
LINE 240: Panting with eagerness, and struggling to suppress my hopes, I hurried
LINE 241: home, and rushed up-stairs to my room, having first provided myself
LINE 242: with a candle, though it was scarcely twilight yet—then, shut and
LINE 243: bolted the door, determined to tolerate no interruption; and sitting
LINE 244: down before the table, opened out my prize and delivered myself up to
LINE 245: its perusal—first hastily turning over the leaves and snatching a
LINE 246: sentence here and there, and then setting myself steadily to read it
LINE 247: through.
LINE 248: I have it now before me; and though you could not, of course, peruse it
LINE 249: with half the interest that I did, I know you would not be satisfied
LINE 250: with an abbreviation of its contents, and you shall have the whole,
LINE 251: save, perhaps, a few passages here and there of merely temporary
LINE 252: interest to the writer, or such as would serve to encumber the story
LINE 253: rather than elucidate it. It begins somewhat abruptly, thus—but we will
LINE 254: reserve its commencement for another chapter.
