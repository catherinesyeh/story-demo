LINE 1: Though my affections might now be said to be fairly weaned from Eliza
LINE 2: Millward, I did not yet entirely relinquish my visits to the vicarage,
LINE 3: because I wanted, as it were, to let her down easy; without raising
LINE 4: much sorrow, or incurring much resentment,—or making myself the talk of
LINE 5: the parish; and besides, if I had wholly kept away, the vicar, who
LINE 6: looked upon my visits as paid chiefly, if not entirely, to himself,
LINE 7: would have felt himself decidedly affronted by the neglect. But when I
LINE 8: called there the day after my interview with Mrs. Graham, he happened
LINE 9: to be from home—a circumstance by no means so agreeable to me now as it
LINE 10: had been on former occasions. Miss Millward was there, it is true, but
LINE 11: she, of course, would be little better than a nonentity. However, I
LINE 12: resolved to make my visit a short one, and to talk to Eliza in a
LINE 13: brotherly, friendly sort of way, such as our long acquaintance might
LINE 14: warrant me in assuming, and which, I thought, could neither give
LINE 15: offence nor serve to encourage false hopes.
LINE 16: It was never my custom to talk about Mrs. Graham either to her or any
LINE 17: one else; but I had not been seated three minutes before she brought
LINE 18: that lady on to the carpet herself in a rather remarkable manner.
LINE 19: "Oh, Mr. Markham!" said she, with a shocked expression and voice
LINE 20: subdued almost to a whisper, "what do you think of these shocking
LINE 21: reports about Mrs. Graham?—can you encourage us to disbelieve them?"
LINE 22: "What reports?"
LINE 23: "Ah, now! _you_ know!" she slily smiled and shook her head.
LINE 24: "I know nothing about them. What in the world do you mean, Eliza?"
LINE 25: "Oh, don't ask _me!—I_ can't explain it." She took up the cambric
LINE 26: handkerchief which she had been beautifying with a deep lace border,
LINE 27: and began to be very busy.
LINE 28: "What is it, Miss Millward? what does she mean?" said I, appealing to
LINE 29: her sister, who seemed to be absorbed in the hemming of a large, coarse
LINE 30: sheet.
LINE 31: "I don't know," replied she. "Some idle slander somebody has been
LINE 32: inventing, I suppose. I never heard it till Eliza told me the other
LINE 33: day,—but if all the parish dinned it in my ears, I shouldn't believe a
LINE 34: word of it—I know Mrs. Graham too well!"
LINE 35: "Quite right, Miss Millward!—and so do I—whatever it may be."
LINE 36: "Well," observed Eliza, with a gentle sigh, "it's well to have such a
LINE 37: comfortable assurance regarding the worth of those we love. I only wish
LINE 38: you may not find your confidence misplaced."
LINE 39: And she raised her face, and gave me such a look of sorrowful
LINE 40: tenderness as might have melted my heart, but within those eyes there
LINE 41: lurked a something that I did not like; and I wondered how I ever could
LINE 42: have admired them—her sister's honest face and small grey optics
LINE 43: appeared far more agreeable. But I was out of temper with Eliza at that
LINE 44: moment for her insinuations against Mrs. Graham, which were false, I
LINE 45: was certain, whether she knew it or not.
LINE 46: I said nothing more on the subject, however, at the time, and but
LINE 47: little on any other; for, finding I could not well recover my
LINE 48: equanimity, I presently rose and took leave, excusing myself under the
LINE 49: plea of business at the farm; and to the farm I went, not troubling my
LINE 50: mind one whit about the possible truth of these mysterious reports, but
LINE 51: only wondering what they were, by whom originated, and on what
LINE 52: foundations raised, and how they could the most effectually be silenced
LINE 53: or disproved.
LINE 54: A few days after this we had another of our quiet little parties, to
LINE 55: which the usual company of friends and neighbours had been invited, and
LINE 56: Mrs. Graham among the number. She could not now absent herself under
LINE 57: the plea of dark evenings or inclement weather, and, greatly to my
LINE 58: relief, she came. Without her I should have found the whole affair an
LINE 59: intolerable bore; but the moment of her arrival brought new life to the
LINE 60: house, and though I might not neglect the other guests for her, or
LINE 61: expect to engross much of her attention and conversation to myself
LINE 62: alone, I anticipated an evening of no common enjoyment.
LINE 63: Mr. Lawrence came too. He did not arrive till some time after the rest
LINE 64: were assembled. I was curious to see how he would comport himself to
LINE 65: Mrs. Graham. A slight bow was all that passed between them on his
LINE 66: entrance; and having politely greeted the other members of the company,
LINE 67: he seated himself quite aloof from the young widow, between my mother
LINE 68: and Rose.
LINE 69: "Did you ever see such art?" whispered Eliza, who was my nearest
LINE 70: neighbour. "Would you not say they were perfect strangers?"
LINE 71: "Almost; but what then?"
LINE 72: "What then; why, you can't pretend to be ignorant?"
LINE 73: "Ignorant of _what?_" demanded I, so sharply that she started and
LINE 74: replied,—
LINE 75: "Oh, hush! don't speak so loud."
LINE 76: "Well, tell me then," I answered in a lower tone, "what is it you mean?
LINE 77: I hate enigmas."
LINE 78: "Well, you know, I don't vouch for the truth of it—indeed, far from
LINE 79: it—but haven't you heard—?"
LINE 80: "I've heard _nothing_, except from you."
LINE 81: "You must be wilfully deaf then, for anyone will tell you that; but I
LINE 82: shall only anger you by repeating it, I see, so I had better hold my
LINE 83: tongue."
LINE 84: She closed her lips and folded her hands before her, with an air of
LINE 85: injured meekness.
LINE 86: "If you had wished not to anger me, you should have held your tongue
LINE 87: from the beginning, or else spoken out plainly and honestly all you had
LINE 88: to say."
LINE 89: She turned aside her face, pulled out her handkerchief, rose, and went
LINE 90: to the window, where she stood for some time, evidently dissolved in
LINE 91: tears. I was astounded, provoked, ashamed—not so much of my harshness
LINE 92: as for her childish weakness. However, no one seemed to notice her, and
LINE 93: shortly after we were summoned to the tea-table: in those parts it was
LINE 94: customary to sit to the table at tea-time on all occasions, and make a
LINE 95: meal of it, for we dined early. On taking my seat, I had Rose on one
LINE 96: side of me and an empty chair on the other.
LINE 97: "May I sit by you?" said a soft voice at my elbow.
LINE 98: "If you like," was the reply; and Eliza slipped into the vacant chair;
LINE 99: then, looking up in my face with a half-sad, half-playful smile, she
LINE 100: whispered,—"You're so stern, Gilbert."
LINE 101: I handed down her tea with a slightly contemptuous smile, and said
LINE 102: nothing, for I had nothing to say.
LINE 103: "What have I done to offend you?" said she, more plaintively. "I wish I
LINE 104: knew."
LINE 105: "Come, take your tea, Eliza, and don't be foolish," responded I,
LINE 106: handing her the sugar and cream.
LINE 107: Just then there arose a slight commotion on the other side of me,
LINE 108: occasioned by Miss Wilson's coming to negotiate an exchange of seats
LINE 109: with Rose.
LINE 110: "Will you be so good as to exchange places with me, Miss Markham?" said
LINE 111: she; "for I don't like to sit by Mrs. Graham. If your mamma thinks
LINE 112: proper to invite such persons to her house, she cannot object to her
LINE 113: daughter's keeping company with them."
LINE 114: This latter clause was added in a sort of soliloquy when Rose was gone;
LINE 115: but I was not polite enough to let it pass.
LINE 116: "Will you be so good as to tell me what you mean, Miss Wilson?" said I.
LINE 117: The question startled her a little, but not much.
LINE 118: "Why, Mr. Markham," replied she, coolly, having quickly recovered her
LINE 119: self-possession, "it surprises me rather that Mrs. Markham should
LINE 120: invite such a person as Mrs. Graham to her house; but, perhaps, she is
LINE 121: not aware that the lady's character is considered scarcely
LINE 122: respectable."
LINE 123: "She is not, nor am I; and therefore you would oblige me by explaining
LINE 124: your meaning a little further."
LINE 125: "This is scarcely the time or the place for such explanations; but I
LINE 126: think you can hardly be so ignorant as you pretend—you must know her as
LINE 127: well as I do."
LINE 128: "I think I do, perhaps a little better; and therefore, if you will
LINE 129: inform me what you have heard or imagined against her, I shall,
LINE 130: perhaps, be able to set you right."
LINE 131: "Can you tell me, then, who was her husband, or if she ever had any?"
LINE 132: Indignation kept me silent. At such a time and place I could not trust
LINE 133: myself to answer.
LINE 134: "Have you never observed," said Eliza, "what a striking likeness there
LINE 135: is between that child of hers and—"
LINE 136: "And whom?" demanded Miss Wilson, with an air of cold, but keen
LINE 137: severity.
LINE 138: Eliza was startled; the timidly spoken suggestion had been intended for
LINE 139: my ear alone.
LINE 140: "Oh, I beg your pardon!" pleaded she; "I may be mistaken—perhaps I
LINE 141: _was_ mistaken." But she accompanied the words with a sly glance of
LINE 142: derision directed to me from the corner of her disingenuous eye.
LINE 143: "There's no need to ask _my_ pardon," replied her friend, "but I see no
LINE 144: one here that at all resembles that child, except his mother, and when
LINE 145: you hear ill-natured reports, Miss Eliza, I will thank you, that is, I
LINE 146: think you will do well, to refrain from repeating them. I presume the
LINE 147: person you allude to is Mr. Lawrence; but I think I can assure you that
LINE 148: your suspicions, in that respect, are utterly misplaced; and if he has
LINE 149: any particular connection with the lady at all (which no one has a
LINE 150: right to assert), at least he has (what cannot be said of some others)
LINE 151: sufficient sense of propriety to withhold him from acknowledging
LINE 152: anything more than a bowing acquaintance in the presence of respectable
LINE 153: persons; he was evidently both surprised and annoyed to find her here."
LINE 154: "Go it!" cried Fergus, who sat on the other side of Eliza, and was the
LINE 155: only individual who shared that side of the table with us. "Go it like
LINE 156: bricks! mind you don't leave her one stone upon another."
LINE 157: Miss Wilson drew herself up with a look of freezing scorn, but said
LINE 158: nothing. Eliza would have replied, but I interrupted her by saying as
LINE 159: calmly as I could, though in a tone which betrayed, no doubt, some
LINE 160: little of what I felt within,—"We have had enough of this subject; if
LINE 161: we can only speak to slander our betters, let us hold our tongues."
LINE 162: "I think you'd better," observed Fergus, "and so does our good parson;
LINE 163: he has been addressing the company in his richest vein all the while,
LINE 164: and eyeing you, from time to time, with looks of stern distaste, while
LINE 165: you sat there, irreverently whispering and muttering together; and once
LINE 166: he paused in the middle of a story or a sermon, I don't know which, and
LINE 167: fixed his eyes upon you, Gilbert, as much as to say, 'When Mr. Markham
LINE 168: has done flirting with those two ladies I will proceed.'"
LINE 169: What more was said at the tea-table I cannot tell, nor how I found
LINE 170: patience to sit till the meal was over. I remember, however, that I
LINE 171: swallowed with difficulty the remainder of the tea that was in my cup,
LINE 172: and ate nothing; and that the first thing I did was to stare at Arthur
LINE 173: Graham, who sat beside his mother on the opposite side of the table,
LINE 174: and the second to stare at Mr. Lawrence, who sat below; and, first, it
LINE 175: struck me that there _was_ a likeness; but, on further contemplation, I
LINE 176: concluded it was only in imagination.
LINE 177: Both, it is true, had more delicate features and smaller bones than
LINE 178: commonly fall to the lot of individuals of the rougher sex, and
LINE 179: Lawrence's complexion was pale and clear, and Arthur's delicately fair;
LINE 180: but Arthur's tiny, somewhat snubby nose could never become so long and
LINE 181: straight as Mr. Lawrence's; and the outline of his face, though not
LINE 182: full enough to be round, and too finely converging to the small,
LINE 183: dimpled chin to be square, could never be drawn out to the long oval of
LINE 184: the other's, while the child's hair was evidently of a lighter, warmer
LINE 185: tint than the elder gentleman's had ever been, and his large, clear
LINE 186: blue eyes, though prematurely serious at times, were utterly dissimilar
LINE 187: to the shy hazel eyes of Mr. Lawrence, whence the sensitive soul looked
LINE 188: so distrustfully forth, as ever ready to retire within, from the
LINE 189: offences of a too rude, too uncongenial world. Wretch that I was to
LINE 190: harbour that detestable idea for a moment! Did I not know Mrs. Graham?
LINE 191: Had I not seen her, conversed with her time after time? Was I not
LINE 192: certain that she, in intellect, in purity and elevation of soul, was
LINE 193: immeasurably superior to any of her detractors; that she was, in fact,
LINE 194: the noblest, the most adorable, of her sex I had ever beheld, or even
LINE 195: imagined to exist? Yes, and I would say with Mary Millward (sensible
LINE 196: girl as she was), that if all the parish, ay, or all the world, should
LINE 197: din these horrible lies in my ears, I would not believe them, for I
LINE 198: knew her better than they.
LINE 199: Meantime, my brain was on fire with indignation, and my heart seemed
LINE 200: ready to burst from its prison with conflicting passions. I regarded my
LINE 201: two fair neighbours with a feeling of abhorrence and loathing I
LINE 202: scarcely endeavoured to conceal. I was rallied from several quarters
LINE 203: for my abstraction and ungallant neglect of the ladies; but I cared
LINE 204: little for that: all I cared about, besides that one grand subject of
LINE 205: my thoughts, was to see the cups travel up to the tea-tray, and not
LINE 206: come down again. I thought Mr. Millward never _would_ cease telling us
LINE 207: that he was no tea-drinker, and that it was highly injurious to keep
LINE 208: loading the stomach with slops to the exclusion of more wholesome
LINE 209: sustenance, and so give himself time to finish his fourth cup.
LINE 210: At length it was over; and I rose and left the table and the guests
LINE 211: without a word of apology—I could endure their company no longer. I
LINE 212: rushed out to cool my brain in the balmy evening air, and to compose my
LINE 213: mind or indulge my passionate thoughts in the solitude of the garden.
LINE 214: To avoid being seen from the windows I went down a quiet little avenue
LINE 215: that skirted one side of the inclosure, at the bottom of which was a
LINE 216: seat embowered in roses and honeysuckles. Here I sat down to think over
LINE 217: the virtues and wrongs of the lady of Wildfell Hall; but I had not been
LINE 218: so occupied two minutes, before voices and laughter, and glimpses of
LINE 219: moving objects through the trees, informed me that the whole company
LINE 220: had turned out to take an airing in the garden too. However, I nestled
LINE 221: up in a corner of the bower, and hoped to retain possession of it,
LINE 222: secure alike from observation and intrusion. But no—confound it—there
LINE 223: was some one coming down the avenue! Why couldn't they enjoy the
LINE 224: flowers and sunshine of the open garden, and leave that sunless nook to
LINE 225: me, and the gnats and midges?
LINE 226: But, peeping through my fragrant screen of the interwoven branches to
LINE 227: discover who the intruders were (for a murmur of voices told me it was
LINE 228: more than one), my vexation instantly subsided, and far other feelings
LINE 229: agitated my still unquiet soul; for there was Mrs. Graham, slowly
LINE 230: moving down the walk with Arthur by her side, and no one else. Why were
LINE 231: they alone? Had the poison of detracting tongues already spread through
LINE 232: all; and had they all turned their backs upon her? I now recollected
LINE 233: having seen Mrs. Wilson, in the early part of the evening, edging her
LINE 234: chair close up to my mother, and bending forward, evidently in the
LINE 235: delivery of some important confidential intelligence; and from the
LINE 236: incessant wagging of her head, the frequent distortions of her wrinkled
LINE 237: physiognomy, and the winking and malicious twinkle of her little ugly
LINE 238: eyes, I judged it was some spicy piece of scandal that engaged her
LINE 239: powers; and from the cautious privacy of the communication I supposed
LINE 240: some person then present was the luckless object of her calumnies: and
LINE 241: from all these tokens, together with my mother's looks and gestures of
LINE 242: mingled horror and incredulity, I now concluded that object to have
LINE 243: been Mrs. Graham. I did not emerge from my place of concealment till
LINE 244: she had nearly reached the bottom of the walk, lest my appearance
LINE 245: should drive her away; and when I did step forward she stood still and
LINE 246: seemed inclined to turn back as it was.
LINE 247: "Oh, don't let us disturb you, Mr. Markham!" said she. "We came here to
LINE 248: seek retirement ourselves, not to intrude on your seclusion."
LINE 249: "I am no hermit, Mrs. Graham—though I own it looks rather like it to
LINE 250: absent myself in this uncourteous fashion from my guests."
LINE 251: "I feared you were unwell," said she, with a look of real concern.
LINE 252: "I was rather, but it's over now. Do sit here a little and rest, and
LINE 253: tell me how you like this arbour," said I, and, lifting Arthur by the
LINE 254: shoulders, I planted him in the middle of the seat by way of securing
LINE 255: his mamma, who, acknowledging it to be a tempting place of refuge,
LINE 256: threw herself back in one corner, while I took possession of the other.
LINE 257: But that word refuge disturbed me. Had their unkindness then really
LINE 258: driven her to seek for peace in solitude?
LINE 259: "Why have they left you alone?" I asked.
LINE 260: "It is I who have left them," was the smiling rejoinder. "I was wearied
LINE 261: to death with small talk—nothing wears me out like that. I cannot
LINE 262: imagine how they _can_ go on as they do."
LINE 263: I could not help smiling at the serious depth of her wonderment.
LINE 264: "Is it that they think it a _duty_ to be continually talking," pursued
LINE 265: she: "and so never pause to think, but fill up with aimless trifles and
LINE 266: vain repetitions when subjects of real interest fail to present
LINE 267: themselves, or do they really take a pleasure in such discourse?"
LINE 268: "Very likely they do," said I; "their shallow minds can hold no great
LINE 269: ideas, and their light heads are carried away by trivialities that
LINE 270: would not move a better-furnished skull; and their only alternative to
LINE 271: such discourse is to plunge over head and ears into the slough of
LINE 272: scandal—which is their chief delight."
LINE 273: "Not all of them, surely?" cried the lady, astonished at the bitterness
LINE 274: of my remark.
LINE 275: "No, certainly; I exonerate my sister from such degraded tastes, and my
LINE 276: mother too, if you included _her_ in your animadversions."
LINE 277: "I meant no animadversions against any one, and certainly intended no
LINE 278: disrespectful allusions to your mother. I have known some sensible
LINE 279: persons great adepts in that style of conversation when circumstances
LINE 280: impelled them to it; but it is a gift I cannot boast the possession of.
LINE 281: I kept up my attention on this occasion as long as I could, but when my
LINE 282: powers were exhausted I stole away to seek a few minutes' repose in
LINE 283: this quiet walk. I hate talking where there is no exchange of ideas or
LINE 284: sentiments, and no good given or received."
LINE 285: "Well," said I, "if ever I trouble you with my loquacity, tell me so at
LINE 286: once, and I promise not to be offended; for I possess the faculty of
LINE 287: enjoying the company of those I—of my friends as well in silence as in
LINE 288: conversation."
LINE 289: "I don't quite believe you; but if it were so you would exactly suit me
LINE 290: for a companion."
LINE 291: "I am all you wish, then, in other respects?"
LINE 292: "No, I don't mean that. How beautiful those little clusters of foliage
LINE 293: look, where the sun comes through behind them!" said she, on purpose to
LINE 294: change the subject.
LINE 295: And they did look beautiful, where at intervals the level rays of the
LINE 296: sun penetrating the thickness of trees and shrubs on the opposite side
LINE 297: of the path before us, relieved their dusky verdure by displaying
LINE 298: patches of semi-transparent leaves of resplendent golden green.
LINE 299: "I almost wish I were not a painter," observed my companion.
LINE 300: "Why so? one would think at such a time you would most exult in your
LINE 301: privilege of being able to imitate the various brilliant and delightful
LINE 302: touches of nature."
LINE 303: "No; for instead of delivering myself up to the full enjoyment of them
LINE 304: as others do, I am always troubling my head about how I could produce
LINE 305: the same effect upon canvas; and as that can never be done, it is mere
LINE 306: vanity and vexation of spirit."
LINE 307: "Perhaps you cannot do it to satisfy yourself, but you may and do
LINE 308: succeed in delighting others with the result of your endeavours."
LINE 309: "Well, after all, I should not complain: perhaps few people gain their
LINE 310: livelihood with so much pleasure in their toil as I do. Here is some
LINE 311: one coming."
LINE 312: She seemed vexed at the interruption.
LINE 313: "It is only Mr. Lawrence and Miss Wilson," said I, "coming to enjoy a
LINE 314: quiet stroll. They will not disturb us."
LINE 315: I could not quite decipher the expression of her face; but I was
LINE 316: satisfied there was no jealousy therein. What business had I to look
LINE 317: for it?
LINE 318: "What sort of a person is Miss Wilson?" she asked.
LINE 319: "She is elegant and accomplished above the generality of her birth and
LINE 320: station; and some say she is ladylike and agreeable."
LINE 321: "I thought her somewhat frigid and rather supercilious in her manner
LINE 322: to-day."
LINE 323: "Very likely she might be so to you. She has possibly taken a prejudice
LINE 324: against you, for I think she regards you in the light of a rival."
LINE 325: "Me! Impossible, Mr. Markham!" said she, evidently astonished and
LINE 326: annoyed.
LINE 327: "Well, I know nothing about it," returned I, rather doggedly; for I
LINE 328: thought her annoyance was chiefly against myself.
LINE 329: The pair had now approached within a few paces of us. Our arbour was
LINE 330: set snugly back in a corner, before which the avenue at its termination
LINE 331: turned off into the more airy walk along the bottom of the garden. As
LINE 332: they approached this, I saw, by the aspect of Jane Wilson, that she was
LINE 333: directing her companion's attention to us; and, as well by her cold,
LINE 334: sarcastic smile as by the few isolated words of her discourse that
LINE 335: reached me, I knew full well that she was impressing him with the idea,
LINE 336: that we were strongly attached to each other. I noticed that he
LINE 337: coloured up to the temples, gave us one furtive glance in passing, and
LINE 338: walked on, looking grave, but seemingly offering no reply to her
LINE 339: remarks.
LINE 340: It was true, then, that he _had_ some designs upon Mrs. Graham; and,
LINE 341: were they honourable, he would not be so anxious to conceal them. _She_
LINE 342: was blameless, of course, but he was detestable beyond all count.
LINE 343: While these thoughts flashed through my mind, my companion abruptly
LINE 344: rose, and calling her son, said they would now go in quest of the
LINE 345: company, and departed up the avenue. Doubtless she had heard or guessed
LINE 346: something of Miss Wilson's remarks, and therefore it was natural enough
LINE 347: she should choose to continue the _tête-à-tête_ no longer, especially
LINE 348: as at that moment my cheeks were burning with indignation against my
LINE 349: former friend, the token of which she might mistake for a blush of
LINE 350: stupid embarrassment. For this I owed Miss Wilson yet another grudge;
LINE 351: and still the more I thought upon her conduct the more I hated her.
LINE 352: It was late in the evening before I joined the company. I found Mrs.
LINE 353: Graham already equipped for departure, and taking leave of the rest,
LINE 354: who were now returned to the house. I offered, nay, begged to accompany
LINE 355: her home. Mr. Lawrence was standing by at the time conversing with some
LINE 356: one else. He did not look at us, but, on hearing my earnest request, he
LINE 357: paused in the middle of a sentence to listen for her reply, and went
LINE 358: on, with a look of quiet satisfaction, the moment he found it was to be
LINE 359: a denial.
LINE 360: A denial it was, decided, though not unkind. She could not be persuaded
LINE 361: to think there was danger for herself or her child in traversing those
LINE 362: lonely lanes and fields without attendance. It was daylight still, and
LINE 363: she should meet no one; or if she did, the people were quiet and
LINE 364: harmless she was well assured. In fact, she would not hear of any one's
LINE 365: putting himself out of the way to accompany her, though Fergus
LINE 366: vouchsafed to offer his services in case they should be more acceptable
LINE 367: than mine, and my mother begged she might send one of the farming-men
LINE 368: to escort her.
LINE 369: When she was gone the rest was all a blank or worse. Lawrence attempted
LINE 370: to draw me into conversation, but I snubbed him and went to another
LINE 371: part of the room. Shortly after the party broke up and he himself took
LINE 372: leave. When he came to me I was blind to his extended hand, and deaf to
LINE 373: his good-night till he repeated it a second time; and then, to get rid
LINE 374: of him, I muttered an inarticulate reply, accompanied by a sulky nod.
LINE 375: "What is the matter, Markham?" whispered he.
LINE 376: I replied by a wrathful and contemptuous stare.
LINE 377: "Are you angry because Mrs. Graham would not let you go home with her?"
