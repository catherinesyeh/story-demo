LINE 1: Five or six days after this Mr. Lawrence paid us the honour of a call;
LINE 2: and when he and I were alone together—which I contrived as soon as
LINE 3: possible by bringing him out to look at my cornstacks—he showed me
LINE 4: another letter from his sister. This one he was quite willing to submit
LINE 5: to my longing gaze; he thought, I suppose, it would do me good. The
LINE 6: only answer it gave to my message was this:—
LINE 7: "Mr. Markham is at liberty to make such revelations concerning me as he
LINE 8: judges necessary. He will know that I should wish but little to be said
LINE 9: on the subject. I hope he is well; but tell him he must not think of
LINE 10: me."
LINE 11: I can give you a few extracts from the rest of the letter, for I was
LINE 12: permitted to keep this also—perhaps, as an antidote to all pernicious
LINE 13: hopes and fancies.
LINE 14: * * * * *
LINE 15: He is decidedly better, but very low from the depressing effects of his
LINE 16: severe illness and the strict regimen he is obliged to observe—so
LINE 17: opposite to all his previous habits. It is deplorable to see how
LINE 18: completely his past life has degenerated his once noble constitution,
LINE 19: and vitiated the whole system of his organization. But the doctor says
LINE 20: he may now be considered out of danger, if he will only continue to
LINE 21: observe the necessary restrictions. Some stimulating cordials he must
LINE 22: have, but they should be judiciously diluted and sparingly used; and I
LINE 23: find it very difficult to keep him to this. At first, his extreme dread
LINE 24: of death rendered the task an easy one; but in proportion as he feels
LINE 25: his acute suffering abating, and sees the danger receding, the more
LINE 26: intractable he becomes. Now, also, his appetite for food is beginning
LINE 27: to return; and here, too, his long habits of self-indulgence are
LINE 28: greatly against him. I watch and restrain him as well as I can, and
LINE 29: often get bitterly abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he
LINE 30: contrives to elude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in opposition to my
LINE 31: will. But he is now so completely reconciled to my attendance in
LINE 32: general that he is never satisfied when I am not by his side. I am
LINE 33: obliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes, or he would make a
LINE 34: complete slave of me; and I know it would be unpardonable weakness to
LINE 35: give up all other interests for him. I have the servants to overlook,
LINE 36: and my little Arthur to attend to,—and my own health too, all of which
LINE 37: would be entirely neglected were I to satisfy his exorbitant demands. I
LINE 38: do not generally sit up at night, for I think the nurse who has made it
LINE 39: her business is better qualified for such undertakings than I am;—but
LINE 40: still, an unbroken night's rest is what I but seldom enjoy, and never
LINE 41: can venture to reckon upon; for my patient makes no scruple of calling
LINE 42: me up at an hour when his wants or his fancies require my presence. But
LINE 43: he is manifestly afraid of my displeasure; and if at one time he tries
LINE 44: my patience by his unreasonable exactions, and fretful complaints and
LINE 45: reproaches, at another he depresses me by his abject submission and
LINE 46: deprecatory self-abasement when he fears he has gone too far. But all
LINE 47: this I can readily pardon; I know it is chiefly the result of his
LINE 48: enfeebled frame and disordered nerves. What annoys me the most, is his
LINE 49: occasional attempts at affectionate fondness that I can neither credit
LINE 50: nor return; not that I hate him: his sufferings and my own laborious
LINE 51: care have given him some claim to my regard—to my affection even, if he
LINE 52: would only be quiet and sincere, and content to let things remain as
LINE 53: they are; but the more he tries to conciliate me, the more I shrink
LINE 54: from him and from the future.
LINE 55: "Helen, what do you mean to do when I get well?" he asked this morning.
LINE 56: "Will you run away again?"
LINE 57: "It entirely depends upon your own conduct."
LINE 58: "Oh, I'll be very good."
LINE 59: "But if I find it necessary to leave you, Arthur, I shall not 'run
LINE 60: away': you know I have your own promise that I may go whenever I
LINE 61: please, and take my son with me."
LINE 62: "Oh, but you shall have no cause." And then followed a variety of
LINE 63: professions, which I rather coldly checked.
LINE 64: "Will you not forgive me, then?" said he.
LINE 65: "Yes,—I _have_ forgiven you: but I know you cannot love me as you once
LINE 66: did—and I should be very sorry if you were to, for I could not pretend
LINE 67: to return it: so let us drop the subject, and never recur to it again.
LINE 68: By what I _have_ done for you, you may judge of what I _will_ do—if it
LINE 69: be not incompatible with the higher duty I owe to my son (higher,
LINE 70: because he never forfeited his claims, and because I hope to do more
LINE 71: good to him than I can ever do to you); and if you wish me to feel
LINE 72: kindly towards you, it is _deeds_ not _words_ which must purchase my
LINE 73: affection and esteem."
LINE 74: His sole reply to this was a slight grimace, and a scarcely perceptible
LINE 75: shrug. Alas, unhappy man! words, with him, are so much cheaper than
LINE 76: deeds; it was as if I had said, "Pounds, not pence, must buy the
LINE 77: article you want." And then he sighed a querulous, self-commiserating
LINE 78: sigh, as if in pure regret that he, the loved and courted of so many
LINE 79: worshippers, should be now abandoned to the mercy of a harsh, exacting,
LINE 80: cold-hearted woman like that, and even glad of what kindness she chose
LINE 81: to bestow.
LINE 82: "It's a pity, isn't it?" said I; and whether I rightly divined his
LINE 83: musings or not, the observation chimed in with his thoughts, for he
LINE 84: answered—"It can't be helped," with a rueful smile at my penetration.
LINE 85: * * * * *
LINE 86: I have seen Esther Hargrave twice. She is a charming creature, but her
LINE 87: blithe spirit is almost broken, and her sweet temper almost spoiled, by
LINE 88: the still unremitting persecutions of her mother in behalf of her
LINE 89: rejected suitor—not violent, but wearisome and unremitting like a
LINE 90: continual dropping. The unnatural parent seems determined to make her
LINE 91: daughter's life a burden, if she will not yield to her desires.
LINE 92: "Mamma does all she can," said she, "to make me feel myself a burden
LINE 93: and incumbrance to the family, and the most ungrateful, selfish, and
LINE 94: undutiful daughter that ever was born; and Walter, too, is as stern and
LINE 95: cold and haughty as if he hated me outright. I believe I should have
LINE 96: yielded at once if I had known, from the beginning, how much resistance
LINE 97: would have cost me; but now, for very obstinacy's sake, I _will_ stand
LINE 98: out!"
LINE 99: "A bad motive for a good resolve," I answered. "But, however, I know
LINE 100: you have better motives, really, for your perseverance: and I counsel
LINE 101: you to keep them still in view."
LINE 102: "Trust me I will. I threaten mamma sometimes that I'll run away, and
LINE 103: disgrace the family by earning my own livelihood, if she torments me
LINE 104: any more; and then that frightens her a little. But I _will_ do it, in
LINE 105: good earnest, if they don't mind."
LINE 106: "Be quiet and patient a while," said I, "and better times will come."
LINE 107: Poor girl! I wish somebody that was worthy to possess her would come
LINE 108: and take her away—don't you, Frederick?
LINE 109: * * * * *
LINE 110: If the perusal of this letter filled me with dismay for Helen's future
LINE 111: life and mine, there was one great source of consolation: it was now in
LINE 112: my power to clear her name from every foul aspersion. The Millwards and
LINE 113: the Wilsons should see with their own eyes the bright sun bursting from
LINE 114: the cloud—and they should be scorched and dazzled by its beams;—and my
LINE 115: own friends too should see it—they whose suspicions had been such gall
LINE 116: and wormwood to my soul. To effect this I had only to drop the seed
LINE 117: into the ground, and it would soon become a stately, branching herb: a
LINE 118: few words to my mother and sister, I knew, would suffice to spread the
LINE 119: news throughout the whole neighbourhood, without any further exertion
LINE 120: on my part.
LINE 121: Rose was delighted; and as soon as I had told her all I thought
LINE 122: proper—which was all I affected to know—she flew with alacrity to put
LINE 123: on her bonnet and shawl, and hasten to carry the glad tidings to the
LINE 124: Millwards and Wilsons—glad tidings, I suspect, to none but herself and
LINE 125: Mary Millward—that steady, sensible girl, whose sterling worth had been
LINE 126: so quickly perceived and duly valued by the supposed Mrs. Graham, in
LINE 127: spite of her plain outside; and who, on her part, had been better able
LINE 128: to see and appreciate that lady's true character and qualities than the
LINE 129: brightest genius among them.
LINE 130: As I may never have occasion to mention her again, I may as well tell
LINE 131: you here that she was at this time privately engaged to Richard
LINE 132: Wilson—a secret, I believe, to every one but themselves. That worthy
LINE 133: student was now at Cambridge, where his most exemplary conduct and his
LINE 134: diligent perseverance in the pursuit of learning carried him safely
LINE 135: through, and eventually brought him with hard-earned honours, and an
LINE 136: untarnished reputation, to the close of his collegiate career. In due
LINE 137: time he became Mr. Millward's first and only curate—for that
LINE 138: gentleman's declining years forced him at last to acknowledge that the
LINE 139: duties of his extensive parish were a little too much for those vaunted
LINE 140: energies which he was wont to boast over his younger and less active
LINE 141: brethren of the cloth. This was what the patient, faithful lovers had
LINE 142: privately planned and quietly waited for years ago; and in due time
LINE 143: they were united, to the astonishment of the little world they lived
LINE 144: in, that had long since declared them both born to single blessedness;
LINE 145: affirming it impossible that the pale, retiring bookworm should ever
LINE 146: summon courage to seek a wife, or be able to obtain one if he did, and
LINE 147: equally impossible that the plain-looking, plain-dealing, unattractive,
LINE 148: unconciliating Miss Millward should ever find a husband.
LINE 149: They still continued to live at the vicarage, the lady dividing her
LINE 150: time between her father, her husband, and their poor parishioners,—and
LINE 151: subsequently her rising family; and now that the Reverend Michael
LINE 152: Millward has been gathered to his fathers, full of years and honours,
LINE 153: the Reverend Richard Wilson has succeeded him to the vicarage of
LINE 154: Lindenhope, greatly to the satisfaction of its inhabitants, who had so
LINE 155: long tried and fully proved his merits, and those of his excellent and
LINE 156: well-loved partner.
LINE 157: If you are interested in the after fate of that lady's sister, I can
LINE 158: only tell you—what perhaps you have heard from another quarter—that
LINE 159: some twelve or thirteen years ago she relieved the happy couple of her
LINE 160: presence by marrying a wealthy tradesman of L——; and I don't envy him
LINE 161: his bargain. I fear she leads him a rather uncomfortable life, though,
LINE 162: happily, he is too dull to perceive the extent of his misfortune. I
LINE 163: have little enough to do with her myself: we have not met for many
LINE 164: years; but, I am well assured, she has not yet forgotten or forgiven
LINE 165: either her former lover, or the lady whose superior qualities first
LINE 166: opened his eyes to the folly of his boyish attachment.
LINE 167: As for Richard Wilson's sister, she, having been wholly unable to
LINE 168: recapture Mr. Lawrence, or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough
LINE 169: to suit her ideas of what the husband of Jane Wilson ought to be, is
LINE 170: yet in single blessedness. Shortly after the death of her mother she
LINE 171: withdrew the light of her presence from Ryecote Farm, finding it
LINE 172: impossible any longer to endure the rough manners and unsophisticated
LINE 173: habits of her honest brother Robert and his worthy wife, or the idea of
LINE 174: being identified with such vulgar people in the eyes of the world, and
LINE 175: took lodgings in —— the county town, where she lived, and still lives,
LINE 176: I suppose, in a kind of close-fisted, cold, uncomfortable gentility,
LINE 177: doing no good to others, and but little to herself; spending her days
LINE 178: in fancy-work and scandal; referring frequently to her "brother the
LINE 179: vicar," and her "sister, the vicar's lady," but never to her brother
LINE 180: the farmer and her sister the farmer's wife; seeing as much company as
LINE 181: she can without too much expense, but loving no one and beloved by
LINE 182: none—a cold-hearted, supercilious, keenly, insidiously censorious old
LINE 183: maid.
