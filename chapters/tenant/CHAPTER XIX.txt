LINE 1: Twenty-Second: Night.—What have I done? and what will be the end of it?
LINE 2: I cannot calmly reflect upon it; I cannot sleep. I must have recourse
LINE 3: to my diary again; I will commit it to paper to-night, and see what I
LINE 4: shall think of it to-morrow.
LINE 5: I went down to dinner resolving to be cheerful and well-conducted, and
LINE 6: kept my resolution very creditably, considering how my head ached and
LINE 7: how internally wretched I felt. I don't know what is come over me of
LINE 8: late; my very energies, both mental and physical, must be strangely
LINE 9: impaired, or I should not have acted so weakly in many respects as I
LINE 10: have done; but I have not been well this last day or two. I suppose it
LINE 11: is with sleeping and eating so little, and thinking so much, and being
LINE 12: so continually out of humour. But to return. I was exerting myself to
LINE 13: sing and play for the amusement, and at the request, of my aunt and
LINE 14: Milicent, before the gentlemen came into the drawing-room (Miss Wilmot
LINE 15: never likes to waste her musical efforts on ladies' ears alone).
LINE 16: Milicent had asked for a little Scotch song, and I was just in the
LINE 17: middle of it when they entered. The first thing Mr. Huntingdon did was
LINE 18: to walk up to Annabella.
LINE 19: "Now, Miss Wilmot, won't _you_ give us some music to-night?" said he.
LINE 20: "Do now! I know you will, when I tell you that I have been hungering
LINE 21: and thirsting all day for the sound of your voice. Come! the piano's
LINE 22: vacant."
LINE 23: It was, for I had quitted it immediately upon hearing his petition. Had
LINE 24: I been endowed with a proper degree of self-possession, I should have
LINE 25: turned to the lady myself, and cheerfully joined my entreaties to his,
LINE 26: whereby I should have disappointed his expectations, if the affront had
LINE 27: been purposely given, or made him sensible of the wrong, if it had only
LINE 28: arisen from thoughtlessness; but I felt it too deeply to do anything
LINE 29: but rise from the music-stool, and throw myself back on the sofa,
LINE 30: suppressing with difficulty the audible expression of the bitterness I
LINE 31: felt within. I knew Annabella's musical talents were superior to mine,
LINE 32: but that was no reason why I should be treated as a perfect nonentity.
LINE 33: The time and the manner of his asking her appeared like a gratuitous
LINE 34: insult to me; and I could have wept with pure vexation.
LINE 35: Meantime, she exultingly seated herself at the piano, and favoured him
LINE 36: with two of his favourite songs, in such superior style that even I
LINE 37: soon lost my anger in admiration, and listened with a sort of gloomy
LINE 38: pleasure to the skilful modulations of her full-toned and powerful
LINE 39: voice, so judiciously aided by her rounded and spirited touch; and
LINE 40: while my ears drank in the sound, my eyes rested on the face of her
LINE 41: principal auditor, and derived an equal or superior delight from the
LINE 42: contemplation of his speaking countenance, as he stood beside her—that
LINE 43: eye and brow lighted up with keen enthusiasm, and that sweet smile
LINE 44: passing and appearing like gleams of sunshine on an April day. No
LINE 45: wonder he should hunger and thirst to hear her sing. I now forgave him
LINE 46: from my heart his reckless slight of me, and I felt ashamed at my
LINE 47: pettish resentment of such a trifle—ashamed too of those bitter envious
LINE 48: pangs that gnawed my inmost heart, in spite of all this admiration and
LINE 49: delight.
LINE 50: "There now," said she, playfully running her fingers over the keys when
LINE 51: she had concluded the second song. "What shall I give you next?"
LINE 52: But in saying this she looked back at Lord Lowborough, who was standing
LINE 53: a little behind, leaning against the back of a chair, an attentive
LINE 54: listener, too, experiencing, to judge by his countenance, much the same
LINE 55: feelings of mingled pleasure and sadness as I did. But the look she
LINE 56: gave him plainly said, "Do you choose for me now: I have done enough
LINE 57: for him, and will gladly exert myself to gratify you;" and thus
LINE 58: encouraged, his lordship came forward, and turning over the music,
LINE 59: presently set before her a little song that I had noticed before, and
LINE 60: read more than once, with an interest arising from the circumstance of
LINE 61: my connecting it in my mind with the reigning tyrant of my thoughts.
LINE 62: And now, with my nerves already excited and half unstrung, I could not
LINE 63: hear those words so sweetly warbled forth without some symptoms of
LINE 64: emotion I was not able to suppress. Tears rose unbidden to my eyes, and
LINE 65: I buried my face in the sofa-pillow that they might flow unseen while I
LINE 66: listened. The air was simple, sweet, and sad. It is still running in my
LINE 67: head, and so are the words:—
LINE 68: Farewell to thee! but not farewell
LINE 69: To all my fondest thoughts of thee:
LINE 70: Within my heart they still shall dwell;
LINE 71: And they shall cheer and comfort me.
LINE 72: O beautiful, and full of grace!
LINE 73: If thou hadst never met mine eye,
LINE 74: I had not dreamed a living face
LINE 75: Could fancied charms so far outvie.
LINE 76: If I may ne'er behold again
LINE 77: That form and face so dear to me,
LINE 78: Nor hear thy voice, still would I fain
LINE 79: Preserve, for aye, their memory.
LINE 80: That voice, the magic of whose tone
LINE 81: Can wake an echo in my breast,
LINE 82: Creating feelings that, alone,
LINE 83: Can make my tranced spirit blest.
LINE 84: That laughing eye, whose sunny beam
LINE 85: My memory would not cherish less;—
LINE 86: And oh, that smile! I whose joyous gleam
LINE 87: No mortal languish can express.
LINE 88: Adieu! but let me cherish, still,
LINE 89: The hope with which I cannot part.
LINE 90: Contempt may wound, and coldness chill,
LINE 91: But still it lingers in my heart.
LINE 92: And who can tell but Heaven, at last,
LINE 93: May answer all my thousand prayers,
LINE 94: And bid the future pay the past
LINE 95: With joy for anguish, smiles for tears.
LINE 96: When it ceased, I longed for nothing so much as to be out of the room.
LINE 97: The sofa was not far from the door, but I did not dare to raise my
LINE 98: head, for I knew Mr. Huntingdon was standing near me, and I knew by the
LINE 99: sound of his voice, as he spoke in answer to some remark of Lord
LINE 100: Lowborough's, that his face was turned towards me. Perhaps a
LINE 101: half-suppressed sob had caught his ear, and caused him to look
LINE 102: round—heaven forbid! But with a violent effort, I checked all further
LINE 103: signs of weakness, dried my tears, and, when I thought he had turned
LINE 104: away again, rose, and instantly left the apartment, taking refuge in my
LINE 105: favourite resort, the library.
LINE 106: There was no light there but the faint red glow of the neglected
LINE 107: fire;—but I did not want a light; I only wanted to indulge my thoughts,
LINE 108: unnoticed and undisturbed; and sitting down on a low stool before the
LINE 109: easy-chair, I sunk my head upon its cushioned seat, and thought, and
LINE 110: thought, until the tears gushed out again, and I wept like any child.
LINE 111: Presently, however, the door was gently opened and someone entered the
LINE 112: room. I trusted it was only a servant, and did not stir. The door was
LINE 113: closed again—but I was not alone; a hand gently touched my shoulder,
LINE 114: and a voice said, softly,—"Helen, what is the matter?"
LINE 115: I could not answer at the moment.
LINE 116: "You must, and shall tell me," was added, more vehemently, and the
LINE 117: speaker threw himself on his knees beside me on the rug, and forcibly
LINE 118: possessed himself of my hand; but I hastily caught it away, and
LINE 119: replied,—"It is nothing to you, Mr. Huntingdon."
LINE 120: "Are you sure it is nothing to me?" he returned; "can you swear that
LINE 121: you were not thinking of me while you wept?" This was unendurable. I
LINE 122: made an effort to rise, but he was kneeling on my dress.
LINE 123: "Tell me," continued he—"I want to know,—because if you were, I have
LINE 124: something to say to you,—and if not, I'll go."
LINE 125: "Go then!" I cried; but, fearing he would obey too well, and never come
LINE 126: again, I hastily added—"Or say what you have to say, and have done with
LINE 127: it!"
LINE 128: "But which?" said he—"for I shall only say it if you really were
LINE 129: thinking of me. So tell me, Helen."
LINE 130: "You're excessively impertinent, Mr. Huntingdon!"
LINE 131: "Not at all—too pertinent, you mean. So you won't tell me?—Well, I'll
LINE 132: spare your woman's pride, and, construing your silence into 'Yes,' I'll
LINE 133: take it for granted that I was the subject of your thoughts, and the
LINE 134: cause of your affliction—"
LINE 135: "Indeed, sir—"
LINE 136: "If you deny it, I won't tell you my secret," threatened he; and I did
LINE 137: not interrupt him again, or even attempt to repulse him: though he had
LINE 138: taken my hand once more, and half embraced me with his other arm, I was
LINE 139: scarcely conscious of it at the time.
LINE 140: "It is this," resumed he: "that Annabella Wilmot, in comparison with
LINE 141: you, is like a flaunting peony compared with a sweet, wild rosebud
LINE 142: gemmed with dew—and I love you to distraction!—Now, tell me if that
LINE 143: intelligence gives you any pleasure. Silence again? That means yes.
LINE 144: Then let me add, that I cannot live without you, and if you answer No
LINE 145: to this last question, you will drive me mad.—Will you bestow yourself
LINE 146: upon me?—you will!" he cried, nearly squeezing me to death in his arms.
LINE 147: "No, no!" I exclaimed, struggling to free myself from him—"you must ask
LINE 148: my uncle and aunt."
LINE 149: "They won't refuse me, if you don't."
LINE 150: "I'm not so sure of that—my aunt dislikes you."
LINE 151: "But _you_ don't, Helen—say you love me, and I'll go."
LINE 152: "I wish you _would_ go!" I replied.
LINE 153: "I will, this instant,—if you'll only say you love me."
LINE 154: "You know I do," I answered. And again he caught me in his arms, and
LINE 155: smothered me with kisses.
LINE 156: At that moment my aunt opened wide the door, and stood before us,
LINE 157: candle in hand, in shocked and horrified amazement, gazing alternately
LINE 158: at Mr. Huntingdon and me—for we had both started up, and now stood wide
LINE 159: enough asunder. But _his_ confusion was only for a moment. Rallying in
LINE 160: an instant, with the most enviable assurance, he began,—"I beg ten
LINE 161: thousand pardons, Mrs. Maxwell! Don't be too severe upon me. I've been
LINE 162: asking your sweet niece to take me for better, for worse; and she, like
LINE 163: a good girl, informs me she cannot think of it without her uncle's and
LINE 164: aunt's consent. So let me implore you not to condemn me to eternal
LINE 165: wretchedness: if _you_ favour my cause, I am safe; for Mr. Maxwell, I
LINE 166: am certain, can refuse you nothing."
LINE 167: "We will talk of this to-morrow, sir," said my aunt, coldly. "It is a
LINE 168: subject that demands mature and serious deliberation. At present, you
LINE 169: had better return to the drawing-room."
LINE 170: "But meantime," pleaded he, "let me commend my cause to your most
LINE 171: indulgent—"
LINE 172: "No indulgence for you, Mr. Huntingdon, must come between me and the
LINE 173: consideration of my niece's happiness."
LINE 174: "Ah, true! I know she is an angel, and I am a presumptuous dog to dream
LINE 175: of possessing such a treasure; but, nevertheless, I would sooner die
LINE 176: than relinquish her in favour of the best man that ever went to
LINE 177: heaven—and as for her happiness, I would sacrifice my body and soul—"
LINE 178: "Body and _soul_, Mr. Huntingdon—sacrifice your _soul?_"
LINE 179: "Well, I would lay down life—"
LINE 180: "You would not be required to lay it down."
LINE 181: "I would spend it, then—devote my life—and all its powers to the
LINE 182: promotion and preservation—"
LINE 183: "Another time, sir, we will talk of this—and I should have felt
LINE 184: disposed to judge more favourably of your pretensions, if you too had
LINE 185: chosen another time and place, and let me add—another _manner_ for your
LINE 186: declaration."
LINE 187: "Why, you see, Mrs. Maxwell," he began—
LINE 188: "Pardon me, sir," said she, with dignity—"The company are inquiring for
LINE 189: you in the other room." And she turned to me.
LINE 190: "Then _you_ must plead for me, Helen," said he, and at length withdrew.
LINE 191: "You had better retire to your room, Helen," said my aunt, gravely. "I
LINE 192: will discuss this matter with you, too, to-morrow."
LINE 193: "Don't be angry, aunt," said I.
LINE 194: "My dear, I am not angry," she replied: "I am _surprised_. If it is
LINE 195: true that you told him you could not accept his offer without our
LINE 196: consent—"
LINE 197: "It _is_ true," interrupted I.
LINE 198: "Then how could you permit—?"
LINE 199: "I couldn't help it, aunt," I cried, bursting into tears. They were not
LINE 200: altogether the tears of sorrow, or of fear for her displeasure, but
LINE 201: rather the outbreak of the general tumultuous excitement of my
LINE 202: feelings. But my good aunt was touched at my agitation. In a softer
LINE 203: tone, she repeated her recommendation to retire, and, gently kissing my
LINE 204: forehead, bade me good-night, and put her candle in my hand; and I
LINE 205: went; but my brain worked so, I could not think of sleeping. I feel
LINE 206: calmer now that I have written all this; and I will go to bed, and try
LINE 207: to win tired nature's sweet restorer.
