LINE 1: September 1st.—No Mr. Huntingdon yet. Perhaps he will stay among his
LINE 2: friends till Christmas; and then, next spring, he will be off again. If
LINE 3: he continue this plan, I shall be able to stay at Grassdale well
LINE 4: enough—that is, I _shall_ be able to stay, and that is enough; even an
LINE 5: occasional bevy of friends at the shooting season may be borne, if
LINE 6: Arthur get so firmly attached to me, so well established in good sense
LINE 7: and principles before they come that I shall be able, by reason and
LINE 8: affection, to keep him pure from their contaminations. Vain hope, I
LINE 9: fear! but still, till such a time of trial comes I will forbear to
LINE 10: think of my quiet asylum in the beloved old hall.
LINE 11: Mr. and Mrs. Hattersley have been staying at the Grove a fortnight: and
LINE 12: as Mr. Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, I
LINE 13: never passed a day without seeing my two friends, Milicent and Esther,
LINE 14: either there or here. On one occasion, when Mr. Hattersley had driven
LINE 15: them over to Grassdale in the phaeton, with little Helen and Ralph, and
LINE 16: we were all enjoying ourselves in the garden—I had a few minutes'
LINE 17: conversation with that gentleman, while the ladies were amusing
LINE 18: themselves with the children.
LINE 19: "Do you want to hear anything of your husband, Mrs. Huntingdon?" said
LINE 20: he.
LINE 21: "No, unless you can tell me when to expect him home."
LINE 22: "I can't.—You don't want him, do you?" said he, with a broad grin.
LINE 23: "No."
LINE 24: "Well, I think you're better without him, sure enough—for my part, I'm
LINE 25: downright weary of him. I told him I'd leave him if he didn't mend his
LINE 26: manners, and he wouldn't; so I left him. You see, I'm a better man than
LINE 27: you think me; and, what's more, I have serious thoughts of washing my
LINE 28: hands of him entirely, and the whole set of 'em, and comporting myself
LINE 29: from this day forward with all decency and sobriety, as a Christian and
LINE 30: the father of a family should do. What do you think of that?"
LINE 31: "It is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago."
LINE 32: "Well, I'm not thirty yet; it isn't too late, is it?"
LINE 33: "No; it is never too late to reform, as long as you have the sense to
LINE 34: desire it, and the strength to execute your purpose."
LINE 35: "Well, to tell you the truth, I've thought of it often and often
LINE 36: before; but he's such devilish good company, is Huntingdon, after all.
LINE 37: You can't imagine what a jovial good fellow he is when he's not fairly
LINE 38: drunk, only just primed or half-seas-over. We all have a bit of a
LINE 39: liking for him at the bottom of our hearts, though we can't respect
LINE 40: him."
LINE 41: "But should you wish yourself to be like him?"
LINE 42: "No, I'd rather be like myself, bad as I am."
LINE 43: "You can't continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more
LINE 44: brutalised every day, and therefore more like him."
LINE 45: I could not help smiling at the comical, half-angry, half-confounded
LINE 46: look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address.
LINE 47: "Never mind my plain speaking," said I; "it is from the best of
LINE 48: motives. But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like Mr.
LINE 49: Huntingdon—or even like yourself?"
LINE 50: "Hang it! no."
LINE 51: "Should you wish your daughter to despise you—or, at least, to feel no
LINE 52: vestige of respect for you, and no affection but what is mingled with
LINE 53: the bitterest regret?"
LINE 54: "Oh, no! I couldn't stand that."
LINE 55: "And, finally, should you wish your wife to be ready to sink into the
LINE 56: earth when she hears you mentioned; and to loathe the very sound of
LINE 57: your voice, and shudder at your approach?"
LINE 58: "She never will; she likes me all the same, whatever I do."
LINE 59: "Impossible, Mr. Hattersley! you mistake her quiet submission for
LINE 60: affection."
LINE 61: "Fire and fury—"
LINE 62: "Now don't burst into a tempest at that. I don't mean to say she does
LINE 63: not love you—she does, I know, a great deal better than you deserve;
LINE 64: but I am quite sure, that if you behave better, she will love you more,
LINE 65: and if you behave worse, she will love you less and less, till all is
LINE 66: lost in fear, aversion, and bitterness of soul, if not in secret hatred
LINE 67: and contempt. But, dropping the subject of affection, should you wish
LINE 68: to be the tyrant of her life—to take away all the sunshine from her
LINE 69: existence, and make her thoroughly miserable?"
LINE 70: "Of course not; and I don't, and I'm not going to."
LINE 71: "You have done more towards it than you suppose."
LINE 72: "Pooh, pooh! she's not the susceptible, anxious, worriting creature you
LINE 73: imagine: she's a little meek, peaceable, affectionate body; apt to be
LINE 74: rather sulky at times, but quiet and cool in the main, and ready to
LINE 75: take things as they come."
LINE 76: "Think of what she was five years ago, when you married her, and what
LINE 77: she is now."
LINE 78: "I know she was a little plump lassie then, with a pretty pink and
LINE 79: white face: now she's a poor little bit of a creature, fading and
LINE 80: melting away like a snow-wreath. But hang it!—that's not my fault."
LINE 81: "What is the cause of it then? Not years, for she's only
LINE 82: five-and-twenty."
LINE 83: "It's her own delicate health, and confound it, madam! what would you
LINE 84: make of me?—and the children, to be sure, that worry her to death
LINE 85: between them."
LINE 86: "No, Mr. Hattersley, the children give her more pleasure than pain:
LINE 87: they are fine, well-dispositioned children—"
LINE 88: "I know they are—bless them!"
LINE 89: "Then why lay the blame on them?—I'll tell you what it is: it's silent
LINE 90: fretting and constant anxiety on your account, mingled, I suspect, with
LINE 91: something of bodily fear on her own. When you behave well, she can only
LINE 92: rejoice with trembling; she has no security, no confidence in your
LINE 93: judgment or principles; but is continually dreading the close of such
LINE 94: short-lived felicity; when you behave ill, her causes of terror and
LINE 95: misery are more than any one can tell but herself. In patient endurance
LINE 96: of evil, she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their
LINE 97: transgressions. Since you _will_ mistake her silence for indifference,
LINE 98: come with me, and I'll show you one or two of her letters—no breach of
LINE 99: confidence, I hope, since you are her other half."
LINE 100: He followed me into the library. I sought out and put into his hands
LINE 101: two of Milicent's letters: one dated from London, and written during
LINE 102: one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation; the other in the
LINE 103: country, during a lucid interval. The former was full of trouble and
LINE 104: anguish; not accusing _him_, but deeply regretting his connection with
LINE 105: his profligate companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others, insinuating
LINE 106: bitter things against Mr. Huntingdon, and most ingeniously throwing the
LINE 107: blame of her husband's misconduct on to other men's shoulders. The
LINE 108: latter was full of hope and joy, yet with a trembling consciousness
LINE 109: that this happiness would not last; praising his goodness to the skies,
LINE 110: but with an evident, though but half-expressed wish, that it were based
LINE 111: on a surer foundation than the natural impulses of the heart, and a
LINE 112: half-prophetic dread of the fall of that house so founded on the
LINE 113: sand,—which fall had shortly after taken place, as Hattersley must have
LINE 114: been conscious while he read.
LINE 115: Almost at the commencement of the first letter I had the unexpected
LINE 116: pleasure of seeing him blush; but he immediately turned his back to me,
LINE 117: and finished the perusal at the window. At the second, I saw him, once
LINE 118: or twice, raise his hand, and hurriedly pass it across his face. Could
LINE 119: it be to dash away a tear? When he had done, there was an interval
LINE 120: spent in clearing his throat and staring out of the window, and then,
LINE 121: after whistling a few bars of a favourite air, he turned round, gave me
LINE 122: back the letters, and silently shook me by the hand.
LINE 123: "I've been a cursed rascal, God knows," said he, as he gave it a hearty
LINE 124: squeeze, "but you see if I don't make amends for it—d—n me if I don't!"
LINE 125: "Don't curse yourself, Mr. Hattersley; if God had heard half your
LINE 126: invocations of that kind, you would have been in hell long before
LINE 127: now—and you _cannot_ make amends for the past by doing your duty for
LINE 128: the future, inasmuch as your duty is only what you _owe_ to your Maker,
LINE 129: and you cannot do _more_ than fulfil it: another must make amends for
LINE 130: your past delinquencies. If you intend to reform, invoke God's
LINE 131: blessing, His mercy, and His aid; not His curse."
LINE 132: "God help me, then—for I'm sure I need it. Where's Milicent?"
LINE 133: "She's there, just coming in with her sister."
LINE 134: He stepped out at the glass door, and went to meet them. I followed at
LINE 135: a little distance. Somewhat to his wife's astonishment, he lifted her
LINE 136: off from the ground, and saluted her with a hearty kiss and a strong
LINE 137: embrace; then placing his two hands on her shoulders, he gave her, I
LINE 138: suppose, a sketch of the great things he meant to do, for she suddenly
LINE 139: threw her arms round him, and burst into tears, exclaiming,—"Do, do,
LINE 140: Ralph—we shall be so happy! How very, very good you are!"
LINE 141: "Nay, not I," said he, turning her round, and pushing her towards me.
LINE 142: "Thank _her;_ it's her doing."
LINE 143: Milicent flew to thank me, overflowing with gratitude. I disclaimed all
LINE 144: title to it, telling her her husband was predisposed to amendment
LINE 145: before I added my mite of exhortation and encouragement, and that I had
LINE 146: only done what she might, and ought to have done herself.
LINE 147: "Oh, no!" cried she; "I couldn't have influenced him, I'm sure, by
LINE 148: anything that I could have said. I should only have bothered him by my
LINE 149: clumsy efforts at persuasion, if I had made the attempt."
LINE 150: "You never tried me, Milly," said he.
LINE 151: Shortly after they took their leave. They are now gone on a visit to
LINE 152: Hattersley's father. After that they will repair to their country home.
LINE 153: I hope his good resolutions will not fall through, and poor Milicent
LINE 154: will not be again disappointed. Her last letter was full of present
LINE 155: bliss, and pleasing anticipations for the future; but no particular
LINE 156: temptation has yet occurred to put his virtue to the test. Henceforth,
LINE 157: however, she will doubtless be somewhat less timid and reserved, and he
LINE 158: more kind and thoughtful.—Surely, then, her hopes are not unfounded;
LINE 159: and I have one bright spot, at least, whereon to rest my thoughts.
