LINE 1: March 20th, 1824. The dreaded time is come, and Arthur is gone, as I
LINE 2: expected. This time he announced it his intention to make but a short
LINE 3: stay in London, and pass over to the Continent, where he should
LINE 4: probably stay a few weeks; but I shall not expect him till after the
LINE 5: lapse of many weeks: I now know that, with him, days signify weeks, and
LINE 6: weeks months.
LINE 7: July 30th.—He returned about three weeks ago, rather better in health,
LINE 8: certainly, than before, but still worse in temper. And yet, perhaps, I
LINE 9: am wrong: it is _I_ that am less patient and forbearing. I am tired out
LINE 10: with his injustice, his selfishness and hopeless _depravity_. I wish a
LINE 11: milder word would do; I am no angel, and my corruption rises against
LINE 12: it. My poor father died last week: Arthur was vexed to hear of it,
LINE 13: because he saw that I was shocked and grieved, and he feared the
LINE 14: circumstance would mar his comfort. When I spoke of ordering my
LINE 15: mourning, he exclaimed,—
LINE 16: "Oh, I hate black! But, however, I suppose you must wear it awhile, for
LINE 17: form's sake; but I hope, Helen, you won't think it your bounden duty to
LINE 18: compose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal garb.
LINE 19: Why should you sigh and groan, and I be made uncomfortable, because an
LINE 20: old gentleman in ——shire, a perfect stranger to us both, has thought
LINE 21: proper to drink himself to death? There, now, I declare you're crying!
LINE 22: Well, it must be affectation."
LINE 23: He would not hear of my attending the funeral, or going for a day or
LINE 24: two, to cheer poor Frederick's solitude. It was quite unnecessary, he
LINE 25: said, and I was unreasonable to wish it. What was my father to me? I
LINE 26: had never seen him but once since I was a baby, and I well knew he had
LINE 27: never cared a stiver about me; and my brother, too, was little better
LINE 28: than a stranger. "Besides, dear Helen," said he, embracing me with
LINE 29: flattering fondness, "I cannot spare you for a single day."
LINE 30: "Then how have you managed without me these _many_ days?" said I.
LINE 31: "Ah! then I was knocking about the world, now I am at home, and home
LINE 32: without you, my household deity, would be intolerable."
LINE 33: "Yes, as long as I am necessary to your comfort; but you did not say so
LINE 34: before, when you urged me to leave you, in order that you might get
LINE 35: away from your home without me," retorted I; but before the words were
LINE 36: well out of my mouth, I regretted having uttered them. It seemed so
LINE 37: heavy a charge: if false, too gross an insult; if true, too humiliating
LINE 38: a fact to be thus openly cast in his teeth. But I might have spared
LINE 39: myself that momentary pang of self-reproach. The accusation awoke
LINE 40: neither shame nor indignation in him: he attempted neither denial nor
LINE 41: excuse, but only answered with a long, low, chuckling laugh, as if he
LINE 42: viewed the whole transaction as a clever, merry jest from beginning to
LINE 43: end. Surely that man will make me dislike him at last!
LINE 44: Sine as ye brew, my maiden fair,
LINE 45: Keep mind that ye maun drink the yill.
LINE 46: Yes; and I _will_ drink it to the very dregs: and none but myself shall
LINE 47: know how bitter I find it!
LINE 48: August 20th.—We are shaken down again to about our usual position.
LINE 49: Arthur has returned to nearly his former condition and habits; and I
LINE 50: have found it my wisest plan to shut my eyes against the past and
LINE 51: future, as far as _he_ at least is concerned, and live only for the
LINE 52: present: to love him when I can; to smile (if possible) when he smiles,
LINE 53: be cheerful when he is cheerful, and pleased when he is agreeable; and
LINE 54: when he is not, to try to make him so; and if that won't answer, to
LINE 55: bear with him, to excuse him, and forgive him as well as I can, and
LINE 56: restrain my own evil passions from aggravating his; and yet, while I
LINE 57: thus yield and minister to his more harmless propensities to
LINE 58: self-indulgence, to do all in my power to save him from the worse.
LINE 59: But we shall not be long alone together. I shall shortly be called upon
LINE 60: to entertain the same select body of friends as we had the autumn
LINE 61: before last, with the addition of Mr. Hattersley and, at my special
LINE 62: request, his wife and child. I long to see Milicent, and her little
LINE 63: girl too. The latter is now above a year old; she will be a charming
LINE 64: playmate for my little Arthur.
LINE 65: September 30th.—Our guests have been here a week or two; but I have had
LINE 66: no leisure to pass any comments upon them till now. I cannot get over
LINE 67: my dislike to Lady Lowborough. It is not founded on mere personal
LINE 68: pique; it is the woman herself that I dislike, because I so thoroughly
LINE 69: disapprove of her. I always avoid her company as much as I can without
LINE 70: violating the laws of hospitality; but when we do speak or converse
LINE 71: together, it is with the utmost civility, even apparent cordiality on
LINE 72: her part; but preserve me from such cordiality! It is like handling
LINE 73: brier-roses and may-blossoms, bright enough to the eye, and outwardly
LINE 74: soft to the touch, but you know there are thorns beneath, and every now
LINE 75: and then you feel them too; and perhaps resent the injury by crushing
LINE 76: them in till you have destroyed their power, though somewhat to the
LINE 77: detriment of your own fingers.
LINE 78: Of late, however, I have seen nothing in her conduct towards Arthur to
LINE 79: anger or alarm me. During the first few days I thought she seemed very
LINE 80: solicitous to win his admiration. Her efforts were not unnoticed by
LINE 81: him: I frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful manœuvres:
LINE 82: but, to his praise be it spoken, her shafts fell powerless by his side.
LINE 83: Her most bewitching smiles, her haughtiest frowns were ever received
LINE 84: with the same immutable, careless good-humour; till, finding he was
LINE 85: indeed impenetrable, she suddenly remitted her efforts, and became, to
LINE 86: all appearance, as perfectly indifferent as himself. Nor have I since
LINE 87: witnessed any symptom of pique on his part, or renewed attempts at
LINE 88: conquest upon hers.
LINE 89: This is as it should be; but Arthur never will let me be satisfied with
LINE 90: him. I have never, for a single hour since I married him, known what it
LINE 91: is to realise that sweet idea, "In quietness and confidence shall be
LINE 92: your rest." Those two detestable men, Grimsby and Hattersley, have
LINE 93: destroyed all my labour against his love of wine. They encourage him
LINE 94: daily to overstep the bounds of moderation, and not unfrequently to
LINE 95: disgrace himself by positive excess. I shall not soon forget the second
LINE 96: night after their arrival. Just as I had retired from the dining-room
LINE 97: with the ladies, before the door was closed upon us, Arthur
LINE 98: exclaimed,—"Now then, my lads, what say you to a regular
LINE 99: jollification?"
LINE 100: Milicent glanced at me with a half-reproachful look, as if _I_ could
LINE 101: hinder it; but her countenance changed when she heard Hattersley's
LINE 102: voice, shouting through door and wall,—
LINE 103: "_I'm_ your man! Send for more wine: here isn't _half_ enough!"
LINE 104: We had scarcely entered the drawing-room before we were joined by Lord
LINE 105: Lowborough.
LINE 106: "What _can_ induce you to come so soon?" exclaimed his lady, with a
LINE 107: most ungracious air of dissatisfaction.
LINE 108: "You know I never drink, Annabella," replied he seriously.
LINE 109: "Well, but you might stay with them a little: it looks so silly to be
LINE 110: always dangling after the women; I wonder you can!"
LINE 111: He reproached her with a look of mingled bitterness and surprise, and,
LINE 112: sinking into a chair, suppressed a heavy sigh, bit his pale lips, and
LINE 113: fixed his eyes upon the floor.
LINE 114: "You did right to leave them, Lord Lowborough," said I. "I trust you
LINE 115: will always continue to honour us so early with your company. And if
LINE 116: Annabella knew the value of true wisdom, and the misery of folly
LINE 117: and—and intemperance, she would not talk such nonsense—even in jest."
LINE 118: He raised his eyes while I spoke, and gravely turned them upon me, with
LINE 119: a half-surprised, half-abstracted look, and then bent them on his wife.
LINE 120: "At least," said she, "I know the value of a warm heart and a bold,
LINE 121: manly spirit."
LINE 122: "Well, Annabella," said he, in a deep and hollow tone, "since my
LINE 123: presence is disagreeable to you, I will relieve you of it."
LINE 124: "Are you going back to them, then?" said she, carelessly.
LINE 125: "No," exclaimed he, with harsh and startling emphasis. "I will not go
LINE 126: back to them! And I will never stay with them one moment longer than I
LINE 127: think right, for you or any other tempter! But you needn't mind that; I
LINE 128: shall never trouble you again by intruding my company upon you so
LINE 129: unseasonably."
LINE 130: He left the room: I heard the hall-door open and shut, and immediately
LINE 131: after, on putting aside the curtain, I saw him pacing down the park, in
LINE 132: the comfortless gloom of the damp, cloudy twilight.
LINE 133: "It would serve you right, Annabella," said I, at length, "if Lord
LINE 134: Lowborough were to return to his old habits, which had so nearly
LINE 135: effected his ruin, and which it cost him such an effort to break: you
LINE 136: would then see cause to repent such conduct as this."
LINE 137: "Not at all, my dear! I should not mind if his lordship were to see fit
LINE 138: to intoxicate himself every day: I should only the sooner be rid of
LINE 139: him."
LINE 140: "Oh, Annabella!" cried Milicent. "How can you say such wicked things!
LINE 141: It would, indeed, be a just punishment, as far as you are concerned, if
LINE 142: Providence should take you at your word, and make you feel what others
LINE 143: feel, that—" She paused as a sudden burst of loud talking and laughter
LINE 144: reached us from the dining-room, in which the voice of Hattersley was
LINE 145: pre-eminently conspicuous, even to my unpractised ear.
LINE 146: "What _you_ feel at this moment, I suppose?" said Lady Lowborough, with
LINE 147: a malicious smile, fixing her eyes upon her cousin's distressed
LINE 148: countenance.
LINE 149: The latter offered no reply, but averted her face and brushed away a
LINE 150: tear. At that moment the door opened and admitted Mr. Hargrave, just a
LINE 151: little flushed, his dark eyes sparkling with unwonted vivacity.
LINE 152: "Oh, I'm so glad you're come, Walter?" cried his sister. "But I wish
LINE 153: you could have got Ralph to come too."
LINE 154: "Utterly impossible, dear Milicent," replied he, gaily. "I had much ado
LINE 155: to get away myself. Ralph attempted to keep me by violence; Huntingdon
LINE 156: threatened me with the eternal loss of his friendship; and Grimsby,
LINE 157: worse than all, endeavoured to make me ashamed of my virtue, by such
LINE 158: galling sarcasms and innuendoes as he knew would wound me the most. So
LINE 159: you see, ladies, you ought to make me welcome when I have braved and
LINE 160: suffered so much for the favour of your sweet society." He smilingly
LINE 161: turned to me and bowed as he finished the sentence.
LINE 162: "Isn't he _handsome_ now, Helen!" whispered Milicent, her sisterly
LINE 163: pride overcoming, for the moment, all other considerations.
LINE 164: "He would be," I returned, "if that brilliance of eye, and lip, and
LINE 165: cheek were natural to him; but look again, a few hours hence."
LINE 166: Here the gentleman took a seat near me at the table, and petitioned for
LINE 167: a cup of coffee.
LINE 168: "I consider this an apt illustration of heaven taken by storm," said
LINE 169: he, as I handed one to him. "I am in paradise, now; but I have fought
LINE 170: my way through flood and fire to win it. Ralph Hattersley's last
LINE 171: resource was to set his back against the door, and swear I should find
LINE 172: no passage but through his body (a pretty substantial one too).
LINE 173: Happily, however, that was not the only door, and I effected my escape
LINE 174: by the side entrance through the butler's pantry, to the infinite
LINE 175: amazement of Benson, who was cleaning the plate."
LINE 176: Mr. Hargrave laughed, and so did his cousin; but his sister and I
LINE 177: remained silent and grave.
LINE 178: "Pardon my levity, Mrs. Huntingdon," murmured he, more seriously, as he
LINE 179: raised his eyes to my face. "You are not used to these things: you
LINE 180: suffer them to affect your delicate mind too sensibly. But I thought of
LINE 181: you in the midst of those lawless roysterers; and I endeavoured to
LINE 182: persuade Mr. Huntingdon to think of you too; but to no purpose: I fear
LINE 183: he is fully determined to enjoy himself this night; and it will be no
LINE 184: use keeping the coffee waiting for him or his companions; it will be
LINE 185: much if they join us at tea. Meantime, I earnestly wish I could banish
LINE 186: the thoughts of them from your mind—and my own too, for I hate to think
LINE 187: of them—yes—even of my dear friend Huntingdon, when I consider the
LINE 188: power he possesses over the happiness of one so immeasurably superior
LINE 189: to himself, and the use he makes of it—I positively _detest_ the man!"
LINE 190: "You had better not say so to me, then," said I; "for, bad as he is, he
LINE 191: is part of myself, and you cannot abuse him without offending me."
LINE 192: "Pardon me, then, for I would sooner die than offend you. But let us
LINE 193: say no more of him for the present, if you please."
LINE 194: At last they came; but not till after ten, when tea, which had been
LINE 195: delayed for more than half an hour, was nearly over. Much as I had
LINE 196: longed for their coming, my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of
LINE 197: their approach; and Milicent turned pale, and almost started from her
LINE 198: seat, as Mr. Hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of
LINE 199: oaths in his mouth, which Hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating
LINE 200: him to remember the ladies.
LINE 201: "Ah! you do well to remind me of the ladies, you dastardly deserter,"
LINE 202: cried he, shaking his formidable fist at his brother-in-law. "If it
LINE 203: were not for them, you well know, I'd demolish you in the twinkling of
LINE 204: an eye, and give your body to the fowls of heaven and the lilies of the
LINE 205: fields!" Then, planting a chair by Lady Lowborough's side, he stationed
LINE 206: himself in it, and began to talk to her with a mixture of absurdity and
LINE 207: impudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her; though she
LINE 208: affected to resent his insolence, and to keep him at bay with sallies
LINE 209: of smart and spirited repartee.
LINE 210: Meantime Mr. Grimsby seated himself by me, in the chair vacated by
LINE 211: Hargrave as they entered, and gravely stated that he would thank me for
LINE 212: a cup of tea: and Arthur placed himself beside poor Milicent,
LINE 213: confidentially pushing his head into her face, and drawing in closer to
LINE 214: her as she shrank away from him. He was not so noisy as Hattersley, but
LINE 215: his face was exceedingly flushed: he laughed incessantly, and while I
LINE 216: blushed for all I saw and heard of him, I was glad that he chose to
LINE 217: talk to his companion in so low a tone that no one could hear what he
LINE 218: said but herself.
LINE 219: "What fools they are!" drawled Mr. Grimsby, who had been talking away,
LINE 220: at my elbow, with sententious gravity all the time; but I had been too
LINE 221: much absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other
LINE 222: two—especially Arthur—to attend to him.
LINE 223: "Did you ever hear such nonsense as they talk, Mrs. Huntingdon?" he
LINE 224: continued. "I'm quite ashamed of them for my part: they can't take so
LINE 225: much as a bottle between them without its getting into their heads—"
LINE 226: "You are pouring the cream into your saucer, Mr. Grimsby."
LINE 227: "Ah! yes, I see, but we're almost in darkness here. Hargrave, snuff
LINE 228: those candles, will you?"
LINE 229: "They're wax; they don't require snuffing," said I.
LINE 230: "'The light of the body is the eye,'" observed Hargrave, with a
LINE 231: sarcastic smile. "'If thine eye be _single_, thy whole body shall be
LINE 232: full of light.'"
LINE 233: Grimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand, and then turning
LINE 234: to me, continued, with the same drawling tones and strange uncertainty
LINE 235: of utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before: "But as I was
LINE 236: saying, Mrs. Huntingdon, they have no head at all: they can't take half
LINE 237: a bottle without being affected some way; whereas I—well, I've taken
LINE 238: three times as much as they have to-night, and you see I'm perfectly
LINE 239: steady. Now that may strike you as very singular, but I think I can
LINE 240: explain it: you see _their_ brains—I mention no names, but you'll
LINE 241: understand to whom I allude—_their_ brains are light to begin with, and
LINE 242: the fumes of the fermented liquor render them lighter still, and
LINE 243: produce an entire light-headedness, or giddiness, resulting in
LINE 244: intoxication; whereas my brains, being composed of more solid
LINE 245: materials, will absorb a considerable quantity of this alcoholic vapour
LINE 246: without the production of any sensible result—"
LINE 247: "I think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea,"
LINE 248: interrupted Mr. Hargrave, "by the quantity of sugar you have put into
LINE 249: it. Instead of your usual complement of one lump, you have put in six."
LINE 250: "Have I so?" replied the philosopher, diving with his spoon into the
LINE 251: cup, and bringing up several half-dissolved pieces in confirmation of
LINE 252: the assertion. "Hum! I perceive. Thus, Madam, you see the evil of
LINE 253: absence of mind—of thinking too much while engaged in the common
LINE 254: concerns of life. Now, if I had had my wits about me, like ordinary
LINE 255: men, instead of within me like a philosopher, I should not have spoiled
LINE 256: this cup of tea, and been constrained to trouble you for another."
LINE 257: "That is the sugar-basin, Mr. Grimsby. Now you have spoiled the sugar
LINE 258: too; and I'll thank you to ring for some more, for here is Lord
LINE 259: Lowborough at last; and I hope his lordship will condescend to sit down
LINE 260: with us, such as we are, and allow me to give him some tea."
LINE 261: His lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal, but said nothing.
LINE 262: Meantime, Hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar, while Grimsby
LINE 263: lamented his mistake, and attempted to prove that it was owing to the
LINE 264: shadow of the urn and the badness of the lights.
LINE 265: Lord Lowborough had entered a minute or two before, unobserved by
LINE 266: anyone but me, and had been standing before the door, grimly surveying
LINE 267: the company. He now stepped up to Annabella, who sat with her back
LINE 268: towards him, with Hattersley still beside her, though not now attending
LINE 269: to her, being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host.
LINE 270: "Well, Annabella," said her husband, as he leant over the back of her
LINE 271: chair, "which of these three 'bold, manly spirits' would you have me to
LINE 272: resemble?"
LINE 273: "By heaven and earth, you shall resemble us all!" cried Hattersley,
LINE 274: starting up and rudely seizing him by the arm. "Hallo, Huntingdon!" he
LINE 275: shouted—"_I've_ got him! Come, man, and help me! And d—n me, if I don't
LINE 276: make him drunk before I let him go! He shall make up for all past
LINE 277: delinquencies as sure as I'm a living soul!"
LINE 278: There followed a disgraceful contest: Lord Lowborough, in desperate
LINE 279: earnest, and pale with anger, silently struggling to release himself
LINE 280: from the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room. I
LINE 281: attempted to urge Arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged guest,
LINE 282: but he could do nothing but laugh.
LINE 283: "Huntingdon, you fool, come and help me, can't you!" cried Hattersley,
LINE 284: himself somewhat weakened by his excesses.
LINE 285: "I'm wishing you God-speed, Hattersley," cried Arthur, "and aiding you
LINE 286: with my prayers: I can't do anything else if my life depended on it!
LINE 287: I'm quite used up. Oh—oh!" and leaning back in his seat, he clapped his
LINE 288: hands on his sides and groaned aloud.
LINE 289: "Annabella, give me a candle!" said Lowborough, whose antagonist had
LINE 290: now got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the
LINE 291: door-post, to which he madly clung with all the energy of desperation.
LINE 292: "_I_ shall take no part in your rude sports!" replied the lady coldly
LINE 293: drawing back. "I wonder you can expect it."
LINE 294: But I snatched up a candle and brought it to him. He took it and held
LINE 295: the flame to Hattersley's hands, till, roaring like a wild beast, the
LINE 296: latter unclasped them and let him go. He vanished, I suppose to his own
LINE 297: apartment, for nothing more was seen of him till the morning. Swearing
LINE 298: and cursing like a maniac, Hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman
LINE 299: beside the window. The door being now free, Milicent attempted to make
LINE 300: her escape from the scene of her husband's disgrace; but he called her
LINE 301: back, and insisted upon her coming to him.
LINE 302: "What do you want, Ralph?" murmured she, reluctantly approaching him.
LINE 303: "I want to know what's the matter with you," said he, pulling her on to
LINE 304: his knee like a child. "What are you crying for, Milicent?—Tell me!"
LINE 305: "I'm not crying."
LINE 306: "You are," persisted he, rudely pulling her hands from her face. "How
LINE 307: dare you tell such a lie!"
LINE 308: "I'm not crying now," pleaded she.
LINE 309: "But you have been, and just this minute too; and I _will_ know what
LINE 310: for. Come, now, you _shall_ tell me!"
LINE 311: "Do let me alone, Ralph! Remember, we are not at home."
LINE 312: "No matter: you _shall_ answer my question!" exclaimed her tormentor;
LINE 313: and he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her, and
LINE 314: remorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful
LINE 315: fingers.
LINE 316: "Don't let him treat your sister in that way," said I to Mr. Hargrave.
LINE 317: "Come now, Hattersley, I can't allow that," said that gentleman,
LINE 318: stepping up to the ill-assorted couple. "Let my sister alone, if you
LINE 319: please."
LINE 320: And he made an effort to unclasp the ruffian's fingers from her arm,
LINE 321: but was suddenly driven backward, and nearly laid upon the floor by a
LINE 322: violent blow on the chest, accompanied with the admonition, "Take that
LINE 323: for your insolence! and learn to interfere between me and mine again."
LINE 324: "If you were not drunk, I'd have satisfaction for that!" gasped
LINE 325: Hargrave, white and breathless as much from passion as from the
LINE 326: immediate effects of the blow.
LINE 327: "Go to the devil!" responded his brother-in-law. "Now, Milicent, tell
LINE 328: me what you were crying for."
LINE 329: "I'll tell you some other time," murmured she, "when we are alone."
LINE 330: "Tell me now!" said he, with another shake and a squeeze that made her
LINE 331: draw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain.
LINE 332: "_I'll_ tell you, Mr. Hattersley," said I. "She was crying from pure
LINE 333: shame and humiliation for you; because she could not bear to see you
LINE 334: conduct yourself so disgracefully."
LINE 335: "Confound you, Madam!" muttered he, with a stare of stupid amazement at
LINE 336: my "impudence." "It was _not_ that—was it, Milicent?"
LINE 337: She was silent.
LINE 338: "Come, speak up, child!"
LINE 339: "I can't tell now," sobbed she.
LINE 340: "But you can say 'yes' or 'no' as well as 'I can't tell.'—Come!"
LINE 341: "Yes," she whispered, hanging her head, and blushing at the awful
LINE 342: acknowledgment.
LINE 343: "Curse you for an impertinent hussy, then!" cried he, throwing her from
LINE 344: him with such violence that she fell on her side; but she was up again
LINE 345: before either I or her brother could come to her assistance, and made
LINE 346: the best of her way out of the room, and, I suppose, up-stairs, without
LINE 347: loss of time.
LINE 348: The next object of assault was Arthur, who sat opposite, and had, no
LINE 349: doubt, richly enjoyed the whole scene.
LINE 350: "Now, Huntingdon," exclaimed his irascible friend, "I WILL NOT have you
LINE 351: sitting there and laughing like an idiot!"
LINE 352: "Oh, Hattersley," cried he, wiping his swimming eyes—"you'll be the
LINE 353: death of me."
LINE 354: "Yes, I will, but not as you suppose: I'll have the heart out of your
LINE 355: body, man, if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile
LINE 356: laughter!—What! are you at it yet?—There! see if that'll settle you!"
LINE 357: cried Hattersley, snatching up a footstool and hurting it at the head
LINE 358: of his host; but he as well as missed his aim, and the latter still sat
LINE 359: collapsed and quaking with feeble laughter, with tears running down his
LINE 360: face: a deplorable spectacle indeed.
LINE 361: Hattersley tried cursing and swearing, but it would not do: he then
LINE 362: took a number of books from the table beside him, and threw them, one
LINE 363: by one, at the object of his wrath; but Arthur only laughed the more;
LINE 364: and, finally, Hattersley rushed upon him in a frenzy and seizing him by
LINE 365: the shoulders, gave him a violent shaking, under which he laughed and
LINE 366: shrieked alarmingly. But I saw no more: I thought I had witnessed
LINE 367: enough of my husband's degradation; and leaving Annabella and the rest
LINE 368: to follow when they pleased, I withdrew, but not to bed. Dismissing
LINE 369: Rachel to her rest, I walked up and down my room, in an agony of misery
LINE 370: for what had been done, and suspense, not knowing what might further
LINE 371: happen, or how or when that unhappy creature would come up to bed.
LINE 372: At last he came, slowly and stumblingly ascending the stairs, supported
LINE 373: by Grimsby and Hattersley, who neither of them walked quite steadily
LINE 374: themselves, but were both laughing and joking at him, and making noise
LINE 375: enough for all the servants to hear. He himself was no longer laughing
LINE 376: now, but sick and stupid. I will write no more about _that_.
LINE 377: Such disgraceful scenes (or nearly such) have been repeated more than
LINE 378: once. I don't say much to Arthur about it, for, if I did, it would do
LINE 379: more harm than good; but I let him know that I intensely dislike such
LINE 380: exhibitions; and each time he has promised they should never again be
LINE 381: repeated. But I fear he is losing the little self-command and
LINE 382: self-respect he once possessed: formerly, he would have been ashamed to
LINE 383: act thus—at least, before any other witnesses than his boon companions,
LINE 384: or such as they. His friend Hargrave, with a prudence and
LINE 385: self-government that I envy for _him_, never disgraces himself by
LINE 386: taking more than sufficient to render him a little "elevated," and is
LINE 387: always the first to leave the table after Lord Lowborough, who, wiser
LINE 388: still, perseveres in vacating the dining-room immediately after us: but
LINE 389: never once, since Annabella offended him so deeply, has he entered the
LINE 390: drawing-room before the rest; always spending the interim in the
LINE 391: library, which I take care to have lighted for his accommodation; or,
LINE 392: on fine moonlight nights, in roaming about the grounds. But I think she
LINE 393: regrets her misconduct, for she has never repeated it since, and of
LINE 394: late she has comported herself with wonderful propriety towards him,
LINE 395: treating him with more uniform kindness and consideration than ever I
LINE 396: have observed her to do before. I date the time of this improvement
LINE 397: from the period when she ceased to hope and strive for Arthur's
LINE 398: admiration.
