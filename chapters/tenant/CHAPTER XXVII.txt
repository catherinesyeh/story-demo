LINE 1: October 9th.—It was on the night of the 4th, a little after tea, that
LINE 2: Annabella had been singing and playing, with Arthur as usual at her
LINE 3: side: she had ended her song, but still she sat at the instrument; and
LINE 4: he stood leaning on the back of her chair, conversing in scarcely
LINE 5: audible tones, with his face in very close proximity with hers. I
LINE 6: looked at Lord Lowborough. He was at the other end of the room, talking
LINE 7: with Messrs. Hargrave and Grimsby; but I saw him dart towards his lady
LINE 8: and his host a quick, impatient glance, expressive of intense
LINE 9: disquietude, at which Grimsby smiled. Determined to interrupt the
LINE 10: _tête-à-tête_, I rose, and, selecting a piece of music from the music
LINE 11: stand, stepped up to the piano, intending to ask the lady to play it;
LINE 12: but I stood transfixed and speechless on seeing her seated there,
LINE 13: listening, with what seemed an exultant smile on her flushed face to
LINE 14: his soft murmurings, with her hand quietly surrendered to his clasp.
LINE 15: The blood rushed first to my heart, and then to my head; for there was
LINE 16: more than this: almost at the moment of my approach, he cast a hurried
LINE 17: glance over his shoulder towards the other occupants of the room, and
LINE 18: then ardently pressed the unresisting hand to his lips. On raising his
LINE 19: eyes, he beheld me, and dropped them again, confounded and dismayed.
LINE 20: She saw me too, and confronted me with a look of hard defiance. I laid
LINE 21: the music on the piano, and retired. I felt ill; but I did not leave
LINE 22: the room: happily, it was getting late, and could not be long before
LINE 23: the company dispersed.
LINE 24: I went to the fire, and leant my head against the chimney-piece. In a
LINE 25: minute or two, some one asked me if I felt unwell. I did not answer;
LINE 26: indeed, at the time, I knew not what was said; but I mechanically
LINE 27: looked up, and saw Mr. Hargrave standing beside me on the rug.
LINE 28: "Shall I get you a glass of wine?" said he.
LINE 29: "No, thank you," I replied; and, turning from him, I looked round. Lady
LINE 30: Lowborough was beside her husband, bending over him as he sat, with her
LINE 31: hand on his shoulder, softly talking and smiling in his face; and
LINE 32: Arthur was at the table, turning over a book of engravings. I seated
LINE 33: myself in the nearest chair; and Mr. Hargrave, finding his services
LINE 34: were not desired, judiciously withdrew. Shortly after, the company
LINE 35: broke up, and, as the guests were retiring to their rooms, Arthur
LINE 36: approached me, smiling with the utmost assurance.
LINE 37: "Are you _very_ angry, Helen?" murmured he.
LINE 38: "This is no jest, Arthur," said I, seriously, but as calmly as I
LINE 39: could—"unless you think it a jest to lose my affection for ever."
LINE 40: "What! so bitter?" he exclaimed, laughingly, clasping my hand between
LINE 41: both his; but I snatched it away, in indignation—almost in disgust, for
LINE 42: he was obviously affected with wine.
LINE 43: "Then I must go down on my knees," said he; and kneeling before me,
LINE 44: with clasped hands, uplifted in mock humiliation, he continued
LINE 45: imploringly—"Forgive me, Helen—dear Helen, forgive me, and I'll _never_
LINE 46: do it again!" and, burying his face in his handkerchief, he affected to
LINE 47: sob aloud.
LINE 48: Leaving him thus employed, I took my candle, and, slipping quietly from
LINE 49: the room, hastened up-stairs as fast as I could. But he soon discovered
LINE 50: that I had left him, and, rushing up after me, caught me in his arms,
LINE 51: just as I had entered the chamber, and was about to shut the door in
LINE 52: his face.
LINE 53: "No, no, by heaven, you sha'n't escape me so!" he cried. Then, alarmed
LINE 54: at my agitation, he begged me not to put myself in such a passion,
LINE 55: telling me I was white in the face, and should kill myself if I did so.
LINE 56: "Let me go, then," I murmured; and immediately he released me—and it
LINE 57: was well he did, for I was really in a passion. I sank into the
LINE 58: easy-chair and endeavoured to compose myself, for I wanted to speak to
LINE 59: him calmly. He stood beside me, but did not venture to touch me or to
LINE 60: speak for a few seconds; then, approaching a little nearer, he dropped
LINE 61: on one knee—not in mock humility, but to bring himself nearer my level,
LINE 62: and leaning his hand on the arm of the chair, he began in a low voice:
LINE 63: "It is all nonsense, Helen—a jest, a mere nothing—not worth a thought.
LINE 64: Will you _never_ learn," he continued more boldly, "that you have
LINE 65: nothing to fear from me? that I love you wholly and entirely?—or if,"
LINE 66: he added with a lurking smile, "I ever give a thought to another, you
LINE 67: may well spare it, for those fancies are here and gone like a flash of
LINE 68: lightning, while my love for you burns on steadily, and for ever, like
LINE 69: the sun. You little exorbitant tyrant, will not _that_—"
LINE 70: "Be quiet a moment, will you, Arthur?" said I, "and listen to me—and
LINE 71: don't think I'm in a jealous fury: I am perfectly calm. Feel my hand."
LINE 72: And I gravely extended it towards him—but closed it upon his with an
LINE 73: energy that seemed to disprove the assertion, and made him smile. "You
LINE 74: needn't smile, sir," said I, still tightening my grasp, and looking
LINE 75: steadfastly on him till he almost quailed before me. "You may think it
LINE 76: all very fine, Mr. Huntingdon, to amuse yourself with rousing my
LINE 77: jealousy; but take care you don't rouse my hate instead. And when you
LINE 78: have once extinguished my love, you will find it no easy matter to
LINE 79: kindle it again."
LINE 80: "Well, Helen, I won't repeat the offence. But I meant nothing by it, I
LINE 81: assure you. I had taken too much wine, and I was scarcely myself at the
LINE 82: time."
LINE 83: "You often take too much; and that is another practice I detest." He
LINE 84: looked up astonished at my warmth. "Yes," I continued; "I never
LINE 85: mentioned it before, because I was ashamed to do so; but now I'll tell
LINE 86: you that it distresses me, and may disgust me, if you go on and suffer
LINE 87: the habit to grow upon you, as it will if you don't check it in time.
LINE 88: But the whole system of your conduct to Lady Lowborough is not
LINE 89: referable to wine; and this night you knew perfectly well what you were
LINE 90: doing."
LINE 91: "Well, I'm sorry for it," replied he, with more of sulkiness than
LINE 92: contrition: "what more would you have?"
LINE 93: "You are sorry that I saw you, no doubt," I answered coldly.
LINE 94: "If you had not seen me," he muttered, fixing his eyes on the carpet,
LINE 95: "it would have done no harm."
LINE 96: My heart felt ready to burst; but I resolutely swallowed back my
LINE 97: emotion, and answered calmly,
LINE 98: "You think not?"
LINE 99: "No," replied he, boldly. "After all, what have I done? It's
LINE 100: nothing—except as you choose to make it a subject of accusation and
LINE 101: distress."
LINE 102: "What would Lord Lowborough, your _friend_, think, if he knew all? or
LINE 103: what would you yourself think, if he or any other had acted the same
LINE 104: part to me, throughout, as you have to Annabella?"
LINE 105: "I would blow his brains out."
LINE 106: "Well, then, Arthur, how can you call it nothing—an offence for which
LINE 107: you would think yourself justified in blowing another man's brains out?
LINE 108: Is it nothing to trifle with your friend's feelings and mine—to
LINE 109: endeavour to steal a woman's affections from her husband—what he values
LINE 110: more than his gold, and therefore what it is more dishonest to take?
LINE 111: Are the marriage vows a jest; and is it nothing to make it your sport
LINE 112: to break them, and to tempt another to do the same? Can I love a man
LINE 113: that does such things, and coolly maintains it is nothing?"
LINE 114: "You are breaking your marriage vows yourself," said he, indignantly
LINE 115: rising and pacing to and fro. "You promised to honour and obey me, and
LINE 116: now you attempt to hector over me, and threaten and accuse me, and call
LINE 117: me worse than a highwayman. If it were not for your situation, Helen, I
LINE 118: would not submit to it so tamely. I won't be dictated to by a woman,
LINE 119: though she be my wife."
LINE 120: "What will you do then? Will you go on till I hate you, and then accuse
LINE 121: me of breaking my vows?"
LINE 122: He was silent a moment, and then replied: "You never will hate me."
LINE 123: Returning and resuming his former position at my feet, he repeated more
LINE 124: vehemently—"You cannot hate me as long as I love you."
LINE 125: "But how can I believe that you love me, if you continue to act in this
LINE 126: way? Just imagine yourself in my place: would _you_ think I loved
LINE 127: _you_, if _I_ did so? Would you believe my protestations, and honour
LINE 128: and trust me under such circumstances?"
LINE 129: "The cases are different," he replied. "It is a woman's nature to be
LINE 130: constant—to love one and one only, blindly, tenderly, and for
LINE 131: ever—bless them, dear creatures! and you above them all; but you must
LINE 132: have some commiseration for us, Helen; you must give us a little more
LINE 133: licence, for, as Shakespeare has it—
LINE 134: However we do praise ourselves,
LINE 135: Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
LINE 136: More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won
LINE 137: Than women's are."
LINE 138: "Do you mean by that, that your fancies are lost to me, and won by Lady
LINE 139: Lowborough?"
LINE 140: "No! heaven is my witness that I think her mere dust and ashes in
LINE 141: comparison with you, and shall continue to think so, unless you drive
LINE 142: me from you by too much severity. She is a daughter of earth; you are
LINE 143: an angel of heaven; only be not too austere in your divinity, and
LINE 144: remember that I am a poor, fallible mortal. Come now, Helen; won't you
LINE 145: forgive me?" he said, gently taking my hand, and looking up with an
LINE 146: innocent smile.
LINE 147: "If I do, you will repeat the offence."
LINE 148: "I swear by—"
LINE 149: "Don't swear; I'll believe your word as well as your oath. I wish I
LINE 150: could have confidence in either."
LINE 151: "Try me, then, Helen: only trust and pardon me this once, and you shall
LINE 152: see! Come, I am in hell's torments till you speak the word."
LINE 153: I did not speak it, but I put my hand on his shoulder and kissed his
LINE 154: forehead, and then burst into tears. He embraced me tenderly; and we
LINE 155: have been good friends ever since. He has been decently temperate at
LINE 156: table, and well-conducted towards Lady Lowborough. The first day he
LINE 157: held himself aloof from her, as far as he could without any flagrant
LINE 158: breach of hospitality: since that he has been friendly and civil, but
LINE 159: nothing more—in my presence, at least, nor, I think, at any other time;
LINE 160: for she seems haughty and displeased, and Lord Lowborough is manifestly
LINE 161: more cheerful, and more cordial towards his host than before. But I
LINE 162: shall be glad when they are gone, for I have so little love for
LINE 163: Annabella that it is quite a task to be civil to her, and as she is the
LINE 164: only woman here besides myself, we are necessarily thrown so much
LINE 165: together. Next time Mrs. Hargrave calls I shall hail her advent as
LINE 166: quite a relief. I have a good mind to ask Arthur's leave to invite the
LINE 167: old lady to stay with us till our guests depart. I think I will. She
LINE 168: will take it as a kind attention, and, though I have little relish for
LINE 169: her society, she will be truly welcome as a third to stand between Lady
LINE 170: Lowborough and me.
LINE 171: The first time the latter and I were alone together, after that unhappy
LINE 172: evening, was an hour or two after breakfast on the following day, when
LINE 173: the gentlemen were gone out, after the usual time spent in the writing
LINE 174: of letters, the reading of newspapers, and desultory conversation. We
LINE 175: sat silent for two or three minutes. She was busy with her work, and I
LINE 176: was running over the columns of a paper from which I had extracted all
LINE 177: the pith some twenty minutes before. It was a moment of painful
LINE 178: embarrassment to me, and I thought it must be infinitely more so to
LINE 179: her; but it seems I was mistaken. She was the first to speak; and,
LINE 180: smiling with the coolest assurance, she began,—
LINE 181: "Your husband was merry last night, Helen: is he often so?"
LINE 182: My blood boiled in my face; but it was better she should seem to
LINE 183: attribute his conduct to this than to anything else.
LINE 184: "No," replied I, "and never will be so again, I trust."
LINE 185: "You gave him a curtain lecture, did you?"
LINE 186: "No! but I told him I disliked such conduct, and he promised me not to
LINE 187: repeat it."
LINE 188: "I _thought_ he looked rather subdued this morning," she continued;
LINE 189: "and you, Helen? you've been weeping, I see—that's our grand resource,
LINE 190: you know. But doesn't it make your eyes smart? and do you always find
LINE 191: it to answer?"
LINE 192: "I never cry for effect; nor can I conceive how any one can."
LINE 193: "Well, I don't know: I never had occasion to try it; but I think if
LINE 194: Lowborough were to commit such improprieties, I'd make _him_ cry. I
LINE 195: don't wonder at your being angry, for I'm sure I'd give my husband a
LINE 196: lesson he would not soon forget for a lighter offence than that. But
LINE 197: then he never _will_ do anything of the kind; for I keep him in too
LINE 198: good order for that."
LINE 199: "Are you sure you don't arrogate too much of the credit to yourself.
LINE 200: Lord Lowborough was quite as remarkable for his abstemiousness for some
LINE 201: time before you married him, as he is now, I have heard."
LINE 202: "Oh, about the _wine_ you mean—yes, he's safe enough for that. And as
LINE 203: to looking askance to another woman, he's safe enough for that too,
LINE 204: while I live, for he worships the very ground I tread on."
LINE 205: "Indeed! and are you sure you deserve it?"
LINE 206: "Why, as to that, I can't say: you know we're all fallible creatures,
LINE 207: Helen; we none of us deserve to be worshipped. But are _you_ sure your
LINE 208: darling Huntingdon deserves all the love you give to _him?_"
LINE 209: I knew not what to answer to this. I was burning with anger; but I
LINE 210: suppressed all outward manifestations of it, and only bit my lip and
LINE 211: pretended to arrange my work.
LINE 212: "At any rate," resumed she, pursuing her advantage, "you can console
LINE 213: yourself with the assurance that _you_ are worthy of all the love he
LINE 214: gives to you."
LINE 215: "You flatter me," said I; "but, at least, I can try to be worthy of
LINE 216: it." And then I turned the conversation.
