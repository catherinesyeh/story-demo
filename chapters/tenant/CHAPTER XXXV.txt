LINE 1: Nineteenth.—In proportion as Lady Lowborough finds she has nothing to
LINE 2: fear from me, and as the time of departure draws nigh, the more
LINE 3: audacious and insolent she becomes. She does not scruple to speak to my
LINE 4: husband with affectionate familiarity in my presence, when no one else
LINE 5: is by, and is particularly fond of displaying her interest in his
LINE 6: health and welfare, or in anything that concerns him, as if for the
LINE 7: purpose of contrasting her kind solicitude with my cold indifference.
LINE 8: And he rewards her by such smiles and glances, such whispered words, or
LINE 9: boldly-spoken insinuations, indicative of his sense of her goodness and
LINE 10: my neglect, as make the blood rush into my face, in spite of myself—for
LINE 11: I would be utterly regardless of it all—deaf and blind to everything
LINE 12: that passes between them, since the more I show myself sensible of
LINE 13: their wickedness the more she triumphs in her victory, and the more he
LINE 14: flatters himself that I love him devotedly still, in spite of my
LINE 15: pretended indifference. On such occasions I have sometimes been
LINE 16: startled by a subtle, fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the
LINE 17: contrary by a seeming encouragement of Hargrave's advances; but such
LINE 18: ideas are banished in a moment with horror and self-abasement; and then
LINE 19: I hate him tenfold more than ever for having brought me to this!—God
LINE 20: pardon me for it and all my sinful thoughts! Instead of being humbled
LINE 21: and purified by my afflictions, I feel that they are turning my nature
LINE 22: into gall. This must be my fault as much as theirs that wrong me. No
LINE 23: true Christian could cherish such bitter feelings as I do against him
LINE 24: and her, especially the latter: him, I still feel that I could
LINE 25: pardon—freely, gladly—on the slightest token of repentance; but
LINE 26: _she_—words cannot utter my abhorrence. Reason forbids, but passion
LINE 27: urges strongly; and I must pray and struggle long ere I subdue it.
LINE 28: It is well that she is leaving to-morrow, for I could not well endure
LINE 29: her presence for another day. This morning she rose earlier than usual.
LINE 30: I found her in the room alone, when I went down to breakfast.
LINE 31: "Oh, Helen! is it you?" said she, turning as I entered.
LINE 32: I gave an involuntary start back on seeing her, at which she uttered a
LINE 33: short laugh, observing, "I think we are _both_ disappointed."
LINE 34: I came forward and busied myself with the breakfast things.
LINE 35: "This is the last day I shall burden your hospitality," said she, as
LINE 36: she seated herself at the table. "Ah, here comes one that will not
LINE 37: rejoice at it!" she murmured, half to herself, as Arthur entered the
LINE 38: room.
LINE 39: He shook hands with her and wished her good-morning: then, looking
LINE 40: lovingly in her face, and still retaining her hand in his, murmured
LINE 41: pathetically, "The last—last day!"
LINE 42: "Yes," said she with some asperity; "and I rose early to make the best
LINE 43: of it—I have been here alone this half-hour, and _you_—you lazy
LINE 44: creature—"
LINE 45: "Well, I thought I was early too," said he; "but," dropping his voice
LINE 46: almost to a whisper, "you see we are not alone."
LINE 47: "We never are," returned she. But they were almost as good as alone,
LINE 48: for I was now standing at the window, watching the clouds, and
LINE 49: struggling to suppress my wrath.
LINE 50: Some more words passed between them, which, happily, I did not
LINE 51: overhear; but Annabella had the audacity to come and place herself
LINE 52: beside me, and even to put her hand upon my shoulder and say softly,
LINE 53: "You need not grudge him to me, Helen, for I love him more than ever
LINE 54: you could do."
LINE 55: This put me beside myself. I took her hand and violently dashed it from
LINE 56: me, with an expression of abhorrence and indignation that could not be
LINE 57: suppressed. Startled, almost appalled, by this sudden outbreak, she
LINE 58: recoiled in silence. I would have given way to my fury and said more,
LINE 59: but Arthur's low laugh recalled me to myself. I checked the
LINE 60: half-uttered invective, and scornfully turned away, regretting that I
LINE 61: had given him so much amusement. He was still laughing when Mr.
LINE 62: Hargrave made his appearance. How much of the scene he had witnessed I
LINE 63: do not know, for the door was ajar when he entered. He greeted his host
LINE 64: and his cousin both coldly, and me with a glance intended to express
LINE 65: the deepest sympathy mingled with high admiration and esteem.
LINE 66: "How much allegiance do you owe to that man?" he asked below his
LINE 67: breath, as he stood beside me at the window, affecting to be making
LINE 68: observations on the weather.
LINE 69: "None," I answered. And immediately returning to the table, I employed
LINE 70: myself in making the tea. He followed, and would have entered into some
LINE 71: kind of conversation with me, but the other guests were now beginning
LINE 72: to assemble, and I took no more notice of him, except to give him his
LINE 73: coffee.
LINE 74: After breakfast, determined to pass as little of the day as possible in
LINE 75: company with Lady Lowborough, I quietly stole away from the company and
LINE 76: retired to the library. Mr. Hargrave followed me thither, under
LINE 77: pretence of coming for a book; and first, turning to the shelves, he
LINE 78: selected a volume, and then quietly, but by no means timidly,
LINE 79: approaching me, he stood beside me, resting his hand on the back of my
LINE 80: chair, and said softly, "And so you consider yourself free at last?"
LINE 81: "Yes," said I, without moving, or raising my eyes from my book, "free
LINE 82: to do anything but offend God and my conscience."
LINE 83: There was a momentary pause.
LINE 84: "Very right," said he, "provided your conscience be not too morbidly
LINE 85: tender, and your ideas of God not too erroneously severe; but can you
LINE 86: suppose it would offend that benevolent Being to make the happiness of
LINE 87: one who would die for yours?—to raise a devoted heart from purgatorial
LINE 88: torments to a state of heavenly bliss, when you could do it without the
LINE 89: slightest injury to yourself or any other?"
LINE 90: This was spoken in a low, earnest, melting tone, as he bent over me. I
LINE 91: now raised my head; and steadily confronting his gaze, I answered
LINE 92: calmly, "Mr. Hargrave, do you mean to insult me?"
LINE 93: He was not prepared for this. He paused a moment to recover the shock;
LINE 94: then, drawing himself up and removing his hand from my chair, he
LINE 95: answered, with proud sadness,—"That was not my intention."
LINE 96: I just glanced towards the door, with a slight movement of the head,
LINE 97: and then returned to my book. He immediately withdrew. This was better
LINE 98: than if I had answered with more words, and in the passionate spirit to
LINE 99: which my first impulse would have prompted. What a good thing it is to
LINE 100: be able to command one's temper! I must labour to cultivate this
LINE 101: inestimable quality: God only knows how often I shall need it in this
LINE 102: rough, dark road that lies before me.
LINE 103: In the course of the morning I drove over to the Grove with the two
LINE 104: ladies, to give Milicent an opportunity for bidding farewell to her
LINE 105: mother and sister. They persuaded her to stay with them the rest of the
LINE 106: day, Mrs. Hargrave promising to bring her back in the evening and
LINE 107: remain till the party broke up on the morrow. Consequently, Lady
LINE 108: Lowborough and I had the pleasure of returning _tête-à-tête_ in the
LINE 109: carriage together. For the first mile or two we kept silence, I looking
LINE 110: out of my window, and she leaning back in her corner. But I was not
LINE 111: going to restrict myself to any particular position for her; when I was
LINE 112: tired of leaning forward, with the cold, raw wind in my face, and
LINE 113: surveying the russet hedges and the damp, tangled grass of their banks,
LINE 114: I gave it up and leant back too. With her usual impudence, my companion
LINE 115: then made some attempts to get up a conversation; but the monosyllables
LINE 116: "yes," or "no" or "humph," were the utmost her several remarks could
LINE 117: elicit from me. At last, on her asking my opinion upon some immaterial
LINE 118: point of discussion, I answered,—
LINE 119: "Why do you wish to talk to me, Lady Lowborough? You must know what I
LINE 120: think of you."
LINE 121: "Well, if you _will_ be so bitter against me," replied she, "I can't
LINE 122: help it; but _I'm_ not going to sulk for anybody." Our short drive was
LINE 123: now at an end. As soon as the carriage door was opened, she sprang out,
LINE 124: and went down the park to meet the gentlemen, who were just returning
LINE 125: from the woods. Of course I did not follow.
LINE 126: But I had not done with her impudence yet: after dinner, I retired to
LINE 127: the drawing-room, as usual, and she accompanied me, but I had the two
LINE 128: children with me, and I gave them my whole attention, and determined to
LINE 129: keep them till the gentlemen came, or till Milicent arrived with her
LINE 130: mother. Little Helen, however, was soon tired of playing, and insisted
LINE 131: upon going to sleep; and while I sat on the sofa with her on my knee,
LINE 132: and Arthur seated beside me, gently playing with her soft, flaxen hair,
LINE 133: Lady Lowborough composedly came and placed herself on the other side.
LINE 134: "To-morrow, Mrs. Huntingdon," said she, "you will be delivered from my
LINE 135: presence, which, no doubt, you will be very glad of—it is natural you
LINE 136: should; but do you know I have rendered you a great service? Shall I
LINE 137: tell you what it is?"
LINE 138: "I shall be glad to hear of any service you have rendered me," said I,
LINE 139: determined to be calm, for I knew by the tone of her voice she wanted
LINE 140: to provoke me.
LINE 141: "Well," resumed she, "have you not observed the salutary change in Mr.
LINE 142: Huntingdon? Don't you see what a sober, temperate man he is become? You
LINE 143: saw with regret the sad habits he was contracting, I know: and I know
LINE 144: you did your utmost to deliver him from them, but without success,
LINE 145: until I came to your assistance. I told him in few words that I could
LINE 146: not bear to see him degrade himself so, and that I should cease to—no
LINE 147: matter what I told him, but you see the reformation I have wrought; and
LINE 148: you ought to thank me for it."
LINE 149: I rose and rang for the nurse.
LINE 150: "But I desire no thanks," she continued; "all the return I ask is, that
LINE 151: you will take care of him when I am gone, and not, by harshness and
LINE 152: neglect, drive him back to his old courses."
LINE 153: I was almost sick with passion, but Rachel was now at the door. I
LINE 154: pointed to the children, for I could not trust myself to speak: she
LINE 155: took them away, and I followed.
LINE 156: "Will you, Helen?" continued the speaker.
LINE 157: I gave her a look that blighted the malicious smile on her face, or
LINE 158: checked it, at least for a moment, and departed. In the ante-room I met
LINE 159: Mr. Hargrave. He saw I was in no humour to be spoken to, and suffered
LINE 160: me to pass without a word; but when, after a few minutes' seclusion in
LINE 161: the library, I had regained my composure, and was returning to join
LINE 162: Mrs. Hargrave and Milicent, whom I had just heard come downstairs and
LINE 163: go into the drawing-room, I found him there still lingering in the
LINE 164: dimly-lighted apartment, and evidently waiting for me.
LINE 165: "Mrs. Huntingdon," said he as I passed, "will you allow me one word?"
LINE 166: "What is it then? be quick, if you please."
LINE 167: "I offended you this morning; and I cannot live under your
LINE 168: displeasure."
LINE 169: "Then go, and sin no more," replied I, turning away.
LINE 170: "No, no!" said he, hastily, setting himself before me. "Pardon me, but
LINE 171: I must have your forgiveness. I leave you to-morrow, and I may not have
LINE 172: an opportunity of speaking to you again. I was wrong to forget myself
LINE 173: and you, as I did; but let me implore you to forget and forgive my rash
LINE 174: presumption, and think of me as if those words had never been spoken;
LINE 175: for, believe me, I regret them deeply, and the loss of your esteem is
LINE 176: too severe a penalty: I cannot bear it."
LINE 177: "Forgetfulness is not to be purchased with a wish; and I cannot bestow
LINE 178: my esteem on all who desire it, unless they deserve it too."
LINE 179: "I shall think my life well spent in labouring to deserve it, if you
LINE 180: will but pardon this offence—will you?"
LINE 181: "Yes."
LINE 182: "Yes! but that is coldly spoken. Give me your hand and I'll believe
LINE 183: you. You won't? Then, Mrs. Huntingdon, you do _not_ forgive me!"
LINE 184: "Yes; here it is, and my forgiveness with it: only, _sin no more_."
LINE 185: He pressed my cold hand with sentimental fervour, but said nothing, and
LINE 186: stood aside to let me pass into the room, where all the company were
LINE 187: now assembled. Mr. Grimsby was seated near the door: on seeing me
LINE 188: enter, almost immediately followed by Hargrave, he leered at me with a
LINE 189: glance of intolerable significance, as I passed. I looked him in the
LINE 190: face, till he sullenly turned away, if not _ashamed_, at least
LINE 191: _confounded_ for the moment. Meantime Hattersley had seized Hargrave by
LINE 192: the arm, and was whispering something in his ear—some coarse joke, no
LINE 193: doubt, for the latter neither laughed nor spoke in answer, but, turning
LINE 194: from him with a slight curl of the lip, disengaged himself and went to
LINE 195: his mother, who was telling Lord Lowborough how many reasons she had to
LINE 196: be proud of her son.
LINE 197: Thank heaven, they are all going to-morrow.
