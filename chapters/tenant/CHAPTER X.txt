LINE 1: When all were gone, I learnt that the vile slander had indeed been
LINE 2: circulated throughout the company, in the very presence of the victim.
LINE 3: Rose, however, vowed she did not and would not believe it, and my
LINE 4: mother made the same declaration, though not, I fear, with the same
LINE 5: amount of real, unwavering incredulity. It seemed to dwell continually
LINE 6: on her mind, and she kept irritating me from time to time by such
LINE 7: expressions as—"Dear, dear, who would have thought it!—Well! I always
LINE 8: thought there was something odd about her.—You see what it is for women
LINE 9: to affect to be different to other people." And once it was,—
LINE 10: "I misdoubted that appearance of mystery from the very first—I
LINE 11: _thought_ there would no good come of it; but this is a sad, sad
LINE 12: business, to be sure!"
LINE 13: "Why, mother, you said you didn't believe these tales," said Fergus.
LINE 14: "No more I do, my dear; but then, you know, there must be some
LINE 15: foundation."
LINE 16: "The foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world," said
LINE 17: I, "and in the fact that Mr. Lawrence has been seen to go that way once
LINE 18: or twice of an evening—and the village gossips say he goes to pay his
LINE 19: addresses to the strange lady, and the scandal-mongers have greedily
LINE 20: seized the rumour, to make it the basis of their own infernal
LINE 21: structure."
LINE 22: "Well, but, Gilbert, there must be something in her _manner_ to
LINE 23: countenance such reports."
LINE 24: "Did _you_ see anything in her manner?"
LINE 25: "No, certainly; but then, you know, I always said there was something
LINE 26: strange about her."
LINE 27: I believe it was on that very evening that I ventured on another
LINE 28: invasion of Wildfell Hall. From the time of our party, which was
LINE 29: upwards of a week ago, I had been making daily efforts to meet its
LINE 30: mistress in her walks; and always disappointed (she must have managed
LINE 31: it so on purpose), had nightly kept revolving in my mind some pretext
LINE 32: for another call. At length I concluded that the separation could be
LINE 33: endured no longer (by this time, you will see, I was pretty far gone);
LINE 34: and, taking from the book-case an old volume that I thought she might
LINE 35: be interested in, though, from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated
LINE 36: condition, I had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal, I hastened
LINE 37: away,—but not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me,
LINE 38: or how I could summon courage to present myself with so slight an
LINE 39: excuse. But, perhaps, I might see her in the field or the garden, and
LINE 40: then there would be no great difficulty: it was the formal knocking at
LINE 41: the door, with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by Rachel, to
LINE 42: the presence of a surprised, uncordial mistress, that so greatly
LINE 43: disturbed me.
LINE 44: My wish, however, was not gratified. Mrs. Graham herself was not to be
LINE 45: seen; but there was Arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in
LINE 46: the garden. I looked over the gate and called him to me. He wanted me
LINE 47: to come in; but I told him I could not without his mother's leave.
LINE 48: "I'll go and ask her," said the child.
LINE 49: "No, no, Arthur, you mustn't do that; but if she's not engaged, just
LINE 50: ask her to come here a minute. Tell her I want to speak to her."
LINE 51: He ran to perform my bidding, and quickly returned with his mother. How
LINE 52: lovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer
LINE 53: breeze, her fair cheek slightly flushed, and her countenance radiant
LINE 54: with smiles. Dear Arthur! what did I not owe to you for this and every
LINE 55: other happy meeting? Through him I was at once delivered from all
LINE 56: formality, and terror, and constraint. In love affairs, there is no
LINE 57: mediator like a merry, simple-hearted child—ever ready to cement
LINE 58: divided hearts, to span the unfriendly gulf of custom, to melt the ice
LINE 59: of cold reserve, and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality
LINE 60: and pride.
LINE 61: "Well, Mr. Markham, what is it?" said the young mother, accosting me
LINE 62: with a pleasant smile.
LINE 63: "I want you to look at this book, and, if you please, to take it, and
LINE 64: peruse it at your leisure. I make no apology for calling you out on
LINE 65: such a lovely evening, though it _be_ for a matter of no greater
LINE 66: importance."
LINE 67: "Tell him to come in, mamma," said Arthur.
LINE 68: "Would you like to come in?" asked the lady.
LINE 69: "Yes; I should like to see your improvements in the garden."
LINE 70: "And how your sister's roots have prospered in my charge," added she,
LINE 71: as she opened the gate.
LINE 72: And we sauntered through the garden, and talked of the flowers, the
LINE 73: trees, and the book, and then of other things. The evening was kind and
LINE 74: genial, and so was my companion. By degrees I waxed more warm and
LINE 75: tender than, perhaps, I had ever been before; but still I said nothing
LINE 76: tangible, and she attempted no repulse, until, in passing a moss
LINE 77: rose-tree that I had brought her some weeks since, in my sister's name,
LINE 78: she plucked a beautiful half-open bud and bade me give it to Rose.
LINE 79: "May I not keep it myself?" I asked.
LINE 80: "No; but here is another for you."
LINE 81: Instead of taking it quietly, I likewise took the hand that offered it,
LINE 82: and looked into her face. She let me hold it for a moment, and I saw a
LINE 83: flash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye, a glow of glad excitement on
LINE 84: her face—I thought my hour of victory was come—but instantly a painful
LINE 85: recollection seemed to flash upon her; a cloud of anguish darkened her
LINE 86: brow, a marble paleness blanched her cheek and lip; there seemed a
LINE 87: moment of inward conflict, and, with a sudden effort, she withdrew her
LINE 88: hand, and retreated a step or two back.
LINE 89: "Now, Mr. Markham," said she, with a kind of desperate calmness, "I
LINE 90: must tell you plainly that I cannot do with this. I like your company,
LINE 91: because I am alone here, and your conversation pleases me more than
LINE 92: that of any other person; but if you cannot be content to regard me as
LINE 93: a friend—a plain, cold, motherly, or sisterly friend—I must beg you to
LINE 94: leave me now, and let me alone hereafter: in fact, we must be strangers
LINE 95: for the future."
LINE 96: "I will, then—be your friend, or brother, or anything you wish, if you
LINE 97: will only let me continue to see you; but tell me why I cannot be
LINE 98: anything more?"
LINE 99: There was a perplexed and thoughtful pause.
LINE 100: "Is it in consequence of some rash vow?"
LINE 101: "It is something of the kind," she answered. "Some day I may tell you,
LINE 102: but at present you had better leave me; and never, Gilbert, put me to
LINE 103: the painful necessity of repeating what I have just now said to you,"
LINE 104: she earnestly added, giving me her hand in serious kindness. How sweet,
LINE 105: how musical my own name sounded in her mouth!
LINE 106: "I will not," I replied. "But you pardon _this_ offence?"
LINE 107: "On condition that you never repeat it."
LINE 108: "And may I come to see you now and then?"
LINE 109: "Perhaps—occasionally; provided you never abuse the privilege."
LINE 110: "I make no empty promises, but you shall see."
LINE 111: "The moment you do our intimacy is at an end, that's all."
LINE 112: "And will you always call me Gilbert? It sounds more sisterly, and it
LINE 113: will serve to remind me of our contract."
LINE 114: She smiled, and once more bid me go; and at length I judged it prudent
LINE 115: to obey, and she re-entered the house and I went down the hill. But as
LINE 116: I went the tramp of horses' hoofs fell on my ear, and broke the
LINE 117: stillness of the dewy evening; and, looking towards the lane, I saw a
LINE 118: solitary equestrian coming up. Inclining to dusk as it was, I knew him
LINE 119: at a glance: it was Mr. Lawrence on his grey pony. I flew across the
LINE 120: field, leaped the stone fence, and then walked down the lane to meet
LINE 121: him. On seeing me, he suddenly drew in his little steed, and seemed
LINE 122: inclined to turn back, but on second thought apparently judged it
LINE 123: better to continue his course as before. He accosted me with a slight
LINE 124: bow, and, edging close to the wall, endeavoured to pass on; but I was
LINE 125: not so minded. Seizing his horse by the bridle, I exclaimed,—"Now,
LINE 126: Lawrence, I will have this mystery explained! Tell me where you are
LINE 127: going, and what you mean to do—at once, and distinctly!"
LINE 128: "Will you take your hand off the bridle?" said he, quietly—"you're
LINE 129: hurting my pony's mouth."
LINE 130: "You and your pony be—"
LINE 131: "What makes you so coarse and brutal, Markham? I'm quite ashamed of
LINE 132: you."
LINE 133: "You answer my questions—before you leave this spot! I _will_ know what
LINE 134: you mean by this perfidious duplicity!"
LINE 135: "I shall answer no questions till you let go the bridle,—if you stand
LINE 136: till morning."
LINE 137: "Now then," said I, unclosing my hand, but still standing before him.
LINE 138: "Ask me some other time, when you can speak like a gentleman," returned
LINE 139: he, and he made an effort to pass me again; but I quickly re-captured
LINE 140: the pony, scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage.
LINE 141: "Really, Mr. Markham, this is _too_ much!" said the latter. "Can I not
LINE 142: go to see my tenant on matters of business, without being assaulted in
LINE 143: this manner by—?"
LINE 144: "This is no time for business, sir!—I'll tell you, now, what I think of
LINE 145: your conduct."
LINE 146: "You'd better defer your opinion to a more convenient season,"
LINE 147: interrupted he in a low tone—"here's the vicar." And, in truth, the
LINE 148: vicar was just behind me, plodding homeward from some remote corner of
LINE 149: his parish. I immediately released the squire; and he went on his way,
LINE 150: saluting Mr. Millward as he passed.
LINE 151: "What! quarrelling, Markham?" cried the latter, addressing himself to
LINE 152: me,—"and about that young widow, I doubt?" he added, reproachfully
LINE 153: shaking his head. "But let me tell you, young man" (here he put his
LINE 154: face into mine with an important, confidential air), "she's not worth
LINE 155: it!" and he confirmed the assertion by a solemn nod.
LINE 156: "MR. MILLWARD," I exclaimed, in a tone of wrathful menace that made the
LINE 157: reverend gentleman look round—aghast—astounded at such unwonted
LINE 158: insolence, and stare me in the face, with a look that plainly said,
LINE 159: "What, this to me!" But I was too indignant to apologise, or to speak
LINE 160: another word to him: I turned away, and hastened homewards, descending
LINE 161: with rapid strides the steep, rough lane, and leaving him to follow as
LINE 162: he pleased.
