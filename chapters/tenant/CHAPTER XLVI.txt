LINE 1: I felt strongly tempted, at times, to enlighten my mother and sister on
LINE 2: the real character and circumstances of the persecuted tenant of
LINE 3: Wildfell Hall, and at first I greatly regretted having omitted to ask
LINE 4: that lady's permission to do so; but, on due reflection, I considered
LINE 5: that if it were known to them, it could not long remain a secret to the
LINE 6: Millwards and Wilsons, and such was my present appreciation of Eliza
LINE 7: Millward's disposition, that, if once she got a clue to the story, I
LINE 8: should fear she would soon find means to enlighten Mr. Huntingdon upon
LINE 9: the place of his wife's retreat. I would therefore wait patiently till
LINE 10: these weary six months were over, and then, when the fugitive had found
LINE 11: another home, and I was permitted to write to her, I would beg to be
LINE 12: allowed to clear her name from these vile calumnies: at present I must
LINE 13: content myself with simply asserting that I knew them to be false, and
LINE 14: would prove it some day, to the shame of those who slandered her. I
LINE 15: don't think anybody believed me, but everybody soon learned to avoid
LINE 16: insinuating a word against her, or even mentioning her name in my
LINE 17: presence. They thought I was so madly infatuated by the seductions of
LINE 18: that unhappy lady that I was determined to support her in the very face
LINE 19: of reason; and meantime I grow insupportably morose and misanthropical
LINE 20: from the idea that every one I met was harbouring unworthy thoughts of
LINE 21: the supposed Mrs. Graham, and would express them if he dared. My poor
LINE 22: mother was quite distressed about me; but I couldn't help it—at least I
LINE 23: thought I could not, though sometimes I felt a pang of remorse for my
LINE 24: undutiful conduct to her, and made an effort to amend, attended with
LINE 25: some partial success; and indeed I was generally more humanised in my
LINE 26: demeanour to her than to any one else, Mr. Lawrence excepted. Rose and
LINE 27: Fergus usually shunned my presence; and it was well they did, for I was
LINE 28: not fit company for them, nor they for me, under the present
LINE 29: circumstances.
LINE 30: Mrs. Huntingdon did not leave Wildfell Hall till above two months after
LINE 31: our farewell interview. During that time she never appeared at church,
LINE 32: and I never went near the house: I only knew she was still there by her
LINE 33: brother's brief answers to my many and varied inquiries respecting her.
LINE 34: I was a very constant and attentive visitor to him throughout the whole
LINE 35: period of his illness and convalescence; not only from the interest I
LINE 36: took in his recovery, and my desire to cheer him up and make the utmost
LINE 37: possible amends for my former "brutality," but from my growing
LINE 38: attachment to himself, and the increasing pleasure I found in his
LINE 39: society—partly from his increased cordiality to me, but chiefly on
LINE 40: account of his close connection, both in blood and in affection, with
LINE 41: my adored Helen. I loved him for it better than I liked to express: and
LINE 42: I took a secret delight in pressing those slender white fingers, so
LINE 43: marvellously like her own, considering he was not a woman, and in
LINE 44: watching the passing changes in his fair, pale features, and observing
LINE 45: the intonations of his voice, detecting resemblances which I wondered
LINE 46: had never struck me before. He provoked me at times, indeed, by his
LINE 47: evident reluctance to talk to me about his sister, though I did not
LINE 48: question the friendliness of his motives in wishing to discourage my
LINE 49: remembrance of her.
LINE 50: His recovery was not quite so rapid as he had expected it to be; he was
LINE 51: not able to mount his pony till a fortnight after the date of our
LINE 52: reconciliation; and the first use he made of his returning strength was
LINE 53: to ride over by night to Wildfell Hall, to see his sister. It was a
LINE 54: hazardous enterprise both for him and for her, but he thought it
LINE 55: necessary to consult with her on the subject of her projected
LINE 56: departure, if not to calm her apprehensions respecting his health, and
LINE 57: the worst result was a slight relapse of his illness, for no one knew
LINE 58: of the visit but the inmates of the old Hall, except myself; and I
LINE 59: believe it had not been his intention to mention it to me, for when I
LINE 60: came to see him the next day, and observed he was not so well as he
LINE 61: ought to have been, he merely said he had caught cold by being out too
LINE 62: late in the evening.
LINE 63: "You'll _never_ be able to see your sister, if you don't take care of
LINE 64: yourself," said I, a little provoked at the circumstance on her
LINE 65: account, instead of commiserating him.
LINE 66: "I've seen her already," said he, quietly.
LINE 67: "You've seen her!" cried I, in astonishment.
LINE 68: "Yes." And then he told me what considerations had impelled him to make
LINE 69: the venture, and with what precautions he had made it.
LINE 70: "And how was she?" I eagerly asked.
LINE 71: "As usual," was the brief though sad reply.
LINE 72: "As usual—that is, far from happy and far from strong."
LINE 73: "She is not positively ill," returned he; "and she will recover her
LINE 74: spirits in a while, I have no doubt—but so many trials have been almost
LINE 75: too much for her. How threatening those clouds look," continued he,
LINE 76: turning towards the window. "We shall have thunder-showers before
LINE 77: night, I imagine, and they are just in the midst of stacking my corn.
LINE 78: Have you got yours all in yet?"
LINE 79: "No. And, Lawrence, did she—did your sister mention me?"
LINE 80: "She asked if I had seen you lately."
LINE 81: "And what else did she say?"
LINE 82: "I cannot tell you all she said," replied he, with a slight smile; "for
LINE 83: we talked a good deal, though my stay was but short; but our
LINE 84: conversation was chiefly on the subject of her intended departure,
LINE 85: which I begged her to delay till I was better able to assist her in her
LINE 86: search after another home."
LINE 87: "But did she say no more about me?"
LINE 88: "She did not say much about you, Markham. I should not have encouraged
LINE 89: her to do so, had she been inclined; but happily she was not: she only
LINE 90: asked a few questions concerning you, and seemed satisfied with my
LINE 91: brief answers, wherein she showed herself wiser than her friend; and I
LINE 92: may tell you, too, that she seemed to be far more anxious lest you
LINE 93: should think too much of her, than lest you should forget her."
LINE 94: "She was right."
LINE 95: "But I fear _your_ anxiety is quite the other way respecting her."
LINE 96: "No, it is not: I wish her to be happy; but I don't wish her to forget
LINE 97: me altogether. She knows it is impossible that I should forget _her;_
LINE 98: and she is right to wish me not to remember her too well. I should not
LINE 99: desire her to regret me _too_ deeply; but I can scarcely imagine she
LINE 100: will make herself very unhappy about me, because I know I am not worthy
LINE 101: of it, except in my appreciation of her."
LINE 102: "You are neither of you worthy of a broken heart,—nor of all the sighs,
LINE 103: and tears, and sorrowful thoughts that have been, and I fear will be,
LINE 104: wasted upon you both; but, at present, each has a more exalted opinion
LINE 105: of the other than, I fear, he or she deserves; and my sister's feelings
LINE 106: are naturally full as keen as yours, and I believe _more_ constant; but
LINE 107: she has the good sense and fortitude to strive against them in this
LINE 108: particular; and I trust she will not rest till she has entirely weaned
LINE 109: her thoughts—" he hesitated.
LINE 110: "From me," said I.
LINE 111: "And I wish you would make the like exertions," continued he.
LINE 112: "Did she _tell_ you that that was her intention?"
LINE 113: "No; the question was not broached between us: there was no necessity
LINE 114: for it, for I had no doubt that such was her determination."
LINE 115: "To forget me?"
LINE 116: "Yes, Markham! Why not?"
LINE 117: "Oh, well!" was my only audible reply; but I internally answered,—"No,
LINE 118: Lawrence, you're wrong there: she is _not_ determined to forget me. It
LINE 119: would be _wrong_ to forget one so deeply and fondly devoted to her, who
LINE 120: can so thoroughly appreciate her excellencies, and sympathise with all
LINE 121: her thoughts, as I can do, and it would be wrong in me to forget so
LINE 122: excellent and divine a piece of God's creation as she, when I have once
LINE 123: so truly loved and known her." But I said no more to him on that
LINE 124: subject. I instantly started a new topic of conversation, and soon took
LINE 125: leave of my companion, with a feeling of less cordiality towards him
LINE 126: than usual. Perhaps I had no right to be annoyed at him, but I was so
LINE 127: nevertheless.
LINE 128: In little more than a week after this I met him returning from a visit
LINE 129: to the Wilsons'; and I now resolved to do _him_ a good turn, though at
LINE 130: the expense of his feelings, and perhaps at the risk of incurring that
LINE 131: displeasure which is so commonly the reward of those who give
LINE 132: disagreeable information, or tender their advice unasked. In this,
LINE 133: believe me, I was actuated by no motives of revenge for the occasional
LINE 134: annoyances I had lately sustained from him,—nor yet by any feeling of
LINE 135: malevolent enmity towards Miss Wilson, but purely by the fact that I
LINE 136: could not endure that such a woman should be Mrs. Huntingdon's sister,
LINE 137: and that, as well for his own sake as for hers, I could not bear to
LINE 138: think of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy of him,
LINE 139: and so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home, and the
LINE 140: companion of his life. He had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head
LINE 141: himself, I imagined; but such was his inexperience, and such were the
LINE 142: lady's powers of attraction, and her skill in bringing them to bear
LINE 143: upon his young imagination, that they had not disturbed him long; and I
LINE 144: believe the only effectual causes of the vacillating indecision that
LINE 145: had preserved him hitherto from making an actual declaration of love,
LINE 146: was the consideration of her connections, and especially of her mother,
LINE 147: whom he could not abide. Had they lived at a distance, he might have
LINE 148: surmounted the objection, but within two or three miles of Woodford it
LINE 149: was really no light matter.
LINE 150: "You've been to call on the Wilsons, Lawrence," said I, as I walked
LINE 151: beside his pony.
LINE 152: "Yes," replied he, slightly averting his face: "I thought it but civil
LINE 153: to take the first opportunity of returning their kind attentions, since
LINE 154: they have been so very particular and constant in their inquiries
LINE 155: throughout the whole course of my illness."
LINE 156: "It's all Miss Wilson's doing."
LINE 157: "And if it is," returned he, with a very perceptible blush, "is that
LINE 158: any reason why I should not make a suitable acknowledgment?"
LINE 159: "It is a reason why you should not make the acknowledgment she looks
LINE 160: for."
LINE 161: "Let us drop that subject if you please," said he, in evident
LINE 162: displeasure.
LINE 163: "No, Lawrence, with your leave we'll continue it a while longer; and
LINE 164: I'll tell you something, now we're about it, which you may believe or
LINE 165: not as you choose—only please to remember that it is not my custom to
LINE 166: speak falsely, and that in this case I can have no motive for
LINE 167: misrepresenting the truth—"
LINE 168: "Well, Markham, what now?"
LINE 169: "_Miss Wilson hates your sister._ It may be natural enough that, in her
LINE 170: ignorance of the relationship, she should feel some degree of enmity
LINE 171: against her, but no good or amiable woman would be capable of evincing
LINE 172: that bitter, cold-blooded, designing malice towards a fancied rival
LINE 173: that I have observed in her."
LINE 174: "Markham!"
LINE 175: "Yes—and it is my belief that Eliza Millward and she, if not the very
LINE 176: originators of the slanderous reports that have been propagated, were
LINE 177: designedly the encouragers and chief disseminators of them. She was not
LINE 178: desirous to mix up _your_ name in the matter, of course, but her
LINE 179: delight was, and still is, to blacken your sister's character to the
LINE 180: utmost of her power, without risking too greatly the exposure of her
LINE 181: own malevolence!"
LINE 182: "I cannot believe it," interrupted my companion, his face burning with
LINE 183: indignation.
LINE 184: "Well, as I cannot prove it, I must content myself with asserting that
LINE 185: it is so to the best of my belief; but as you would not willingly marry
LINE 186: Miss Wilson if it _were_ so, you will do well to be cautious, till you
LINE 187: have proved it to be otherwise."
LINE 188: "I never told you, Markham, that I _intended_ to marry Miss Wilson,"
LINE 189: said he, proudly.
LINE 190: "No, but whether you do or not, she intends to marry you."
LINE 191: "Did she tell you so?"
LINE 192: "No, but—"
LINE 193: "Then you have no right to make such an assertion respecting her." He
LINE 194: slightly quickened his pony's pace, but I laid my hand on its mane,
LINE 195: determined he should not leave me yet.
LINE 196: "Wait a moment, Lawrence, and let me explain myself; and don't be so
LINE 197: very—I don't know what to call it—_inaccessible_ as you are.—I know
LINE 198: what you think of Jane Wilson; and I believe I know how far you are
LINE 199: mistaken in your opinion: you think she is singularly charming,
LINE 200: elegant, sensible, and refined: you are not aware that she is selfish,
LINE 201: cold-hearted, ambitious, artful, shallow-minded—"
LINE 202: "Enough, Markham—enough!"
LINE 203: "No; let me finish:—you don't know that, if you married her, your home
LINE 204: would be rayless and comfortless; and it would break your heart at last
LINE 205: to find yourself united to one so wholly incapable of sharing your
LINE 206: tastes, feelings, and ideas—so utterly destitute of sensibility, good
LINE 207: feeling, and true nobility of soul."
LINE 208: "Have you done?" asked my companion quietly.
LINE 209: "Yes;—I know you hate me for my impertinence, but I don't care if it
LINE 210: only conduces to preserve you from that fatal mistake."
LINE 211: "Well!" returned he, with a rather wintry smile—"I'm glad you have
LINE 212: overcome or forgotten your own afflictions so far as to be able to
LINE 213: study so deeply the affairs of others, and trouble your head so
LINE 214: unnecessarily about the fancied or possible calamities of their future
LINE 215: life."
LINE 216: We parted—somewhat coldly again: but still we did not cease to be
LINE 217: friends; and my well-meant warning, though it might have been more
LINE 218: judiciously delivered, as well as more thankfully received, was not
LINE 219: wholly unproductive of the desired effect: his visit to the Wilsons was
LINE 220: not repeated, and though, in our subsequent interviews, he never
LINE 221: mentioned her name to me, nor I to him,—I have reason to believe he
LINE 222: pondered my words in his mind, eagerly though covertly sought
LINE 223: information respecting the fair lady from other quarters, secretly
LINE 224: compared my character of her with what he had himself observed and what
LINE 225: he heard from others, and finally came to the conclusion that, all
LINE 226: things considered, she had much better remain Miss Wilson of Ryecote
LINE 227: Farm than be transmuted into Mrs. Lawrence of Woodford Hall. I believe,
LINE 228: too, that he soon learned to contemplate with secret amazement his
LINE 229: former predilection, and to congratulate himself on the lucky escape he
LINE 230: had made; but he never confessed it to me, or hinted one word of
LINE 231: acknowledgment for the part I had had in his deliverance, but this was
LINE 232: not surprising to any one that knew him as I did.
LINE 233: As for Jane Wilson, she, of course, was disappointed and embittered by
LINE 234: the sudden cold neglect and ultimate desertion of her former admirer.
LINE 235: Had I done wrong to blight her cherished hopes? I think not; and
LINE 236: certainly my conscience has never accused me, from that day to this, of
LINE 237: any evil design in the matter.
