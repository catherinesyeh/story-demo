LINE 1: On reading this I had no reason to disguise my joy and hope from
LINE 2: Frederick Lawrence, for I had none to be ashamed of. I felt no joy but
LINE 3: that his sister was at length released from her afflictive,
LINE 4: overwhelming toil—no hope but that she would in time recover from the
LINE 5: effects of it, and be suffered to rest in peace and quietness, at
LINE 6: least, for the remainder of her life. I experienced a painful
LINE 7: commiseration for her unhappy husband (though fully aware that he had
LINE 8: brought every particle of his sufferings upon himself, and but too well
LINE 9: deserved them all), and a profound sympathy for her own afflictions,
LINE 10: and deep anxiety for the consequences of those harassing cares, those
LINE 11: dreadful vigils, that incessant and deleterious confinement beside a
LINE 12: living corpse—for I was persuaded she had not hinted half the
LINE 13: sufferings she had had to endure.
LINE 14: "You will go to her, Lawrence?" said I, as I put the letter into his
LINE 15: hand.
LINE 16: "Yes, immediately."
LINE 17: "That's right! I'll leave you, then, to prepare for your departure."
LINE 18: "I've done that already, while you were reading the letter, and before
LINE 19: you came; and the carriage is now coming round to the door."
LINE 20: Inly approving his promptitude, I bade him good-morning, and withdrew.
LINE 21: He gave me a searching glance as we pressed each other's hands at
LINE 22: parting; but whatever he sought in my countenance, he saw there nothing
LINE 23: but the most becoming gravity—it might be mingled with a little
LINE 24: sternness in momentary resentment at what I suspected to be passing in
LINE 25: his mind.
LINE 26: Had I forgotten my own prospects, my ardent love, my pertinacious
LINE 27: hopes? It seemed like sacrilege to revert to them now, but I had not
LINE 28: forgotten them. It was, however, with a gloomy sense of the darkness of
LINE 29: those prospects, the fallacy of those hopes, and the vanity of that
LINE 30: affection, that I reflected on those things as I remounted my horse and
LINE 31: slowly journeyed homewards. Mrs. Huntingdon was free now; it was no
LINE 32: longer a crime to think of her—but did she ever think of _me?_ Not
LINE 33: _now_—of course it was not to be expected—but would she when this shock
LINE 34: was over? In all the course of her correspondence with her brother (our
LINE 35: mutual friend, as she herself had called him) she had never mentioned
LINE 36: me but once—and that was from necessity. This alone afforded strong
LINE 37: presumption that I was already forgotten; yet this was not the worst:
LINE 38: it might have been her sense of duty that had kept her silent: she
LINE 39: might be only _trying_ to forget; but in addition to this, I had a
LINE 40: gloomy conviction that the awful realities she had seen and felt, her
LINE 41: reconciliation with the man she had once loved, his dreadful sufferings
LINE 42: and death, must eventually efface from her mind all traces of her
LINE 43: passing love for me. She might recover from these horrors so far as to
LINE 44: be restored to her former health, her tranquillity, her cheerfulness
LINE 45: even—but never to those feelings which would appear to her, henceforth,
LINE 46: as a fleeting fancy, a vain, illusive dream; especially as there was no
LINE 47: one to remind her of my existence—no means of assuring her of my
LINE 48: fervent constancy, now that we were so far apart, and delicacy forbade
LINE 49: me to see her or to write to her, for months to come at least. And how
LINE 50: could I engage her brother in my behalf? how could I break that icy
LINE 51: crust of shy reserve? Perhaps he would disapprove of my attachment now
LINE 52: as highly as before; perhaps he would think me too poor—too lowly born,
LINE 53: to match with his sister. Yes, there was another barrier: doubtless
LINE 54: there was a wide distinction between the rank and circumstances of Mrs.
LINE 55: Huntingdon, the lady of Grassdale Manor, and those of Mrs. Graham, the
LINE 56: artist, the tenant of Wildfell Hall. And it might be deemed presumption
LINE 57: in me to offer my hand to the former, by the world, by her friends, if
LINE 58: not by herself; a penalty I might brave, if I were certain she loved
LINE 59: me; but otherwise, how could I? And, finally, her deceased husband,
LINE 60: with his usual selfishness, might have so constructed his will as to
LINE 61: place restrictions upon her marrying again. So that you see I had
LINE 62: reasons enough for despair if I chose to indulge it.
LINE 63: Nevertheless, it was with no small degree of impatience that I looked
LINE 64: forward to Mr. Lawrence's return from Grassdale: impatience that
LINE 65: increased in proportion as his absence was prolonged. He stayed away
LINE 66: some ten or twelve days. All very right that he should remain to
LINE 67: comfort and help his sister, but he might have written to tell me how
LINE 68: she was, or at least to tell me when to expect his return; for he might
LINE 69: have known I was suffering tortures of anxiety for her, and uncertainty
LINE 70: for my own future prospects. And when he did return, all he told me
LINE 71: about her was, that she had been greatly exhausted and worn by her
LINE 72: unremitting exertions in behalf of that man who had been the scourge of
LINE 73: her life, and had dragged her with him nearly to the portals of the
LINE 74: grave, and was still much shaken and depressed by his melancholy end
LINE 75: and the circumstances attendant upon it; but no word in reference to
LINE 76: me; no intimation that my name had ever passed her lips, or even been
LINE 77: spoken in her presence. To be sure, I asked no questions on the
LINE 78: subject; I could not bring my mind to do so, believing, as I did, that
LINE 79: Lawrence was indeed averse to the idea of my union with his sister.
LINE 80: I saw that he expected to be further questioned concerning his visit,
LINE 81: and I saw too, with the keen perception of awakened jealousy, or
LINE 82: alarmed self-esteem, or by whatever name I ought to call it, that he
LINE 83: rather shrank from that impending scrutiny, and was no less pleased
LINE 84: than surprised to find it did not come. Of course, I was burning with
LINE 85: anger, but pride obliged me to suppress my feelings, and preserve a
LINE 86: smooth face, or at least a stoic calmness, throughout the interview. It
LINE 87: was well it did, for, reviewing the matter in my sober judgment, I must
LINE 88: say it would have been highly absurd and improper to have quarrelled
LINE 89: with him on such an occasion. I must confess, too, that I wronged him
LINE 90: in my heart: the truth was, he liked me very well, but he was fully
LINE 91: aware that a union between Mrs. Huntingdon and me would be what the
LINE 92: world calls a mésalliance; and it was not in his nature to set the
LINE 93: world at defiance; especially in such a case as this, for its dread
LINE 94: laugh, or ill opinion, would be far more terrible to him directed
LINE 95: against his sister than himself. Had he believed that a union was
LINE 96: necessary to the happiness of both, or of either, or had he known how
LINE 97: fervently I loved her, he would have acted differently; but seeing me
LINE 98: so calm and cool, he would not for the world disturb my philosophy; and
LINE 99: though refraining entirely from any active opposition to the match, he
LINE 100: would yet do nothing to bring it about, and would much rather take the
LINE 101: part of prudence, in aiding us to overcome our mutual predilections,
LINE 102: than that of feeling, to encourage them. "And he was in the right of
LINE 103: it," you will say. Perhaps he was; at any rate, I had no business to
LINE 104: feel so bitterly against him as I did; but I could not then regard the
LINE 105: matter in such a moderate light; and, after a brief conversation upon
LINE 106: indifferent topics, I went away, suffering all the pangs of wounded
LINE 107: pride and injured friendship, in addition to those resulting from the
LINE 108: fear that I was indeed forgotten, and the knowledge that she I loved
LINE 109: was alone and afflicted, suffering from injured health and dejected
LINE 110: spirits, and I was forbidden to console or assist her: forbidden even
LINE 111: to assure her of my sympathy, for the transmission of any such message
LINE 112: through Mr. Lawrence was now completely out of the question.
LINE 113: But what should I do? I would wait, and see if she would notice me,
LINE 114: which of course she would not, unless by some kind message intrusted to
LINE 115: her brother, that, in all probability, he would not deliver, and then,
LINE 116: dreadful thought! she would think me cooled and changed for not
LINE 117: returning it, or, perhaps, he had already given her to understand that
LINE 118: I had ceased to think of her. I would wait, however, till the six
LINE 119: months after our parting were fairly passed (which would be about the
LINE 120: close of February), and then I would send her a letter, modestly
LINE 121: reminding her of her former permission to write to her at the close of
LINE 122: that period, and hoping I might avail myself of it—at least to express
LINE 123: my heartfelt sorrow for her late afflictions, my just appreciation of
LINE 124: her generous conduct, and my hope that her health was now completely
LINE 125: re-established, and that she would, some time, be permitted to enjoy
LINE 126: those blessings of a peaceful, happy life, which had been denied her so
LINE 127: long, but which none could more truly be said to merit than
LINE 128: herself—adding a few words of kind remembrance to my little friend
LINE 129: Arthur, with a hope that he had not forgotten me, and perhaps a few
LINE 130: more in reference to bygone times, to the delightful hours I had passed
LINE 131: in her society, and my unfading recollection of them, which was the
LINE 132: salt and solace of my life, and a hope that her recent troubles had not
LINE 133: entirely banished me from her mind. If she did not answer this, of
LINE 134: course I should write no more: if she did (as surely she would, in some
LINE 135: fashion), my future proceedings should be regulated by her reply.
LINE 136: Ten weeks was long to wait in such a miserable state of uncertainty;
LINE 137: but courage! it must be endured! and meantime I would continue to see
LINE 138: Lawrence now and then, though not so often as before, and I would still
LINE 139: pursue my habitual inquiries after his sister, if he had lately heard
LINE 140: from her, and how she was, but nothing more.
LINE 141: I did so, and the answers I received were always provokingly limited to
LINE 142: the letter of the inquiry: she was much as usual: she made no
LINE 143: complaints, but the tone of her last letter evinced great depression of
LINE 144: mind: she said she was better: and, finally, she said she was well, and
LINE 145: very busy with her son's education, and with the management of her late
LINE 146: husband's property, and the regulation of his affairs. The rascal had
LINE 147: never told me how that property was disposed, or whether Mr. Huntingdon
LINE 148: had died intestate or not; and I would sooner die than ask him, lest he
LINE 149: should misconstrue into covetousness my desire to know. He never
LINE 150: offered to show me his sister's letters now, and I never hinted a wish
LINE 151: to see them. February, however, was approaching; December was past;
LINE 152: January, at length, was almost over—a few more weeks, and then, certain
LINE 153: despair or renewal of hope would put an end to this long agony of
LINE 154: suspense.
LINE 155: But alas! it was just about that time she was called to sustain another
LINE 156: blow in the death of her uncle—a worthless old fellow enough in
LINE 157: himself, I daresay, but he had always shown more kindness and affection
LINE 158: to her than to any other creature, and she had always been accustomed
LINE 159: to regard him as a parent. She was with him when he died, and had
LINE 160: assisted her aunt to nurse him during the last stage of his illness.
LINE 161: Her brother went to Staningley to attend the funeral, and told me, upon
LINE 162: his return, that she was still there, endeavouring to cheer her aunt
LINE 163: with her presence, and likely to remain some time. This was bad news
LINE 164: for me, for while she continued there I could not write to her, as I
LINE 165: did not know the address, and would not ask it of him. But week
LINE 166: followed week, and every time I inquired about her she was still at
LINE 167: Staningley.
LINE 168: "Where _is_ Staningley?" I asked at last.
LINE 169: "In ——shire," was the brief reply; and there was something so cold and
LINE 170: dry in the manner of it, that I was effectually deterred from
LINE 171: requesting a more definite account.
LINE 172: "When will she return to Grassdale?" was my next question.
LINE 173: "I don't know."
LINE 174: "Confound it!" I muttered.
LINE 175: "Why, Markham?" asked my companion, with an air of innocent surprise.
LINE 176: But I did not deign to answer him, save by a look of silent, sullen
LINE 177: contempt, at which he turned away, and contemplated the carpet with a
LINE 178: slight smile, half pensive, half amused; but quickly looking up, he
LINE 179: began to talk of other subjects, trying to draw me into a cheerful and
LINE 180: friendly conversation, but I was too much irritated to discourse with
LINE 181: him, and soon took leave.
LINE 182: You see Lawrence and I somehow could not manage to get on very well
LINE 183: together. The fact is, I believe, we were both of us a little too
LINE 184: touchy. It is a troublesome thing, Halford, this susceptibility to
LINE 185: affronts where none are intended. I am no martyr to it now, as you can
LINE 186: bear me witness: I have learned to be merry and wise, to be more easy
LINE 187: with myself and more indulgent to my neighbours, and I can afford to
LINE 188: laugh at both Lawrence and you.
LINE 189: Partly from accident, partly from wilful negligence on my part (for I
LINE 190: was really beginning to dislike him), several weeks elapsed before I
LINE 191: saw my friend again. When we did meet, it was _he_ that sought _me_
LINE 192: out. One bright morning, early in June, he came into the field, where I
LINE 193: was just commencing my hay harvest.
LINE 194: "It is long since I saw you, Markham," said he, after the first few
LINE 195: words had passed between us. "Do you never mean to come to Woodford
LINE 196: again?"
LINE 197: "I called once, and you were out."
LINE 198: "I was sorry, but that was long since; I hoped you would call again,
LINE 199: and now _I_ have called, and _you_ were out, which you generally are,
LINE 200: or I would do myself the pleasure of calling more frequently; but being
LINE 201: determined to see you this time, I have left my pony in the lane, and
LINE 202: come over hedge and ditch to join you; for I am about to leave Woodford
LINE 203: for a while, and may not have the pleasure of seeing you again for a
LINE 204: month or two."
LINE 205: "Where are you going?"
LINE 206: "To Grassdale first," said he, with a half-smile he would willingly
LINE 207: have suppressed if he could.
LINE 208: "To Grassdale! Is she there, then?"
LINE 209: "Yes, but in a day or two she will leave it to accompany Mrs. Maxwell
LINE 210: to F—— for the benefit of the sea air, and I shall go with them." (F——
LINE 211: was at that time a quiet but respectable watering-place: it is
LINE 212: considerably more frequented now.)
LINE 213: Lawrence seemed to expect me to take advantage of this circumstance to
LINE 214: entrust him with some sort of a message to his sister; and I believe he
LINE 215: would have undertaken to deliver it without any material objections, if
LINE 216: I had had the sense to ask him, though of course he would not _offer_
LINE 217: to do so, if I was content to let it alone. But I could not bring
LINE 218: myself to make the request, and it was not till after he was gone, that
LINE 219: I saw how fair an opportunity I had lost; and then, indeed, I deeply
LINE 220: regretted my stupidity and my foolish pride, but it was now too late to
LINE 221: remedy the evil.
LINE 222: He did not return till towards the latter end of August. He wrote to me
LINE 223: twice or thrice from F——, but his letters were most provokingly
LINE 224: unsatisfactory, dealing in generalities or in trifles that I cared
LINE 225: nothing about, or replete with fancies and reflections equally
LINE 226: unwelcome to me at the time, saying next to nothing about his sister,
LINE 227: and little more about himself. I would wait, however, till he came
LINE 228: back; perhaps I could get something more out of him then. At all
LINE 229: events, I would not write to her now, while she was with him and her
LINE 230: aunt, who doubtless would be still more hostile to my presumptuous
LINE 231: aspirations than himself. When she was returned to the silence and
LINE 232: solitude of her own home, it would be my fittest opportunity.
LINE 233: When Lawrence came, however, he was as reserved as ever on the subject
LINE 234: of my keen anxiety. He told me that his sister had derived considerable
LINE 235: benefit from her stay at F—— that her son was quite well, and—alas!
LINE 236: that both of them were gone, with Mrs. Maxwell, back to Staningley, and
LINE 237: there they stayed at least three months. But instead of boring you with
LINE 238: my chagrin, my expectations and disappointments, my fluctuations of
LINE 239: dull despondency and flickering hope, my varying resolutions, now to
LINE 240: drop it, and now to persevere—now to make a bold push, and now to let
LINE 241: things pass and patiently abide my time,—I will employ myself in
LINE 242: settling the business of one or two of the characters introduced in the
LINE 243: course of this narrative, whom I may not have occasion to mention
LINE 244: again.
LINE 245: Some time before Mr. Huntingdon's death Lady Lowborough eloped with
LINE 246: another gallant to the Continent, where, having lived a while in
LINE 247: reckless gaiety and dissipation, they quarrelled and parted. She went
LINE 248: dashing on for a season, but years came and money went: she sunk, at
LINE 249: length, in difficulty and debt, disgrace and misery; and died at last,
LINE 250: as I have heard, in penury, neglect, and utter wretchedness. But this
LINE 251: might be only a report: she may be living yet for anything I or any of
LINE 252: her relatives or former acquaintances can tell; for they have all lost
LINE 253: sight of her long years ago, and would as thoroughly forget her if they
LINE 254: could. Her husband, however, upon this second misdemeanour, immediately
LINE 255: sought and obtained a divorce, and, not long after, married again. It
LINE 256: was well he did, for Lord Lowborough, morose and moody as he seemed,
LINE 257: was not the man for a bachelor's life. No public interests, no
LINE 258: ambitious projects, or active pursuits,—or ties of friendship even (if
LINE 259: he had had any friends), could compensate to him for the absence of
LINE 260: domestic comforts and endearments. He had a son and a nominal daughter,
LINE 261: it is true, but they too painfully reminded him of their mother, and
LINE 262: the unfortunate little Annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness
LINE 263: to his soul. He had obliged himself to treat her with paternal
LINE 264: kindness: he had forced himself not to hate her, and even, perhaps, to
LINE 265: feel some degree of kindly regard for her, at last, in return for her
LINE 266: artless and unsuspecting attachment to himself; but the bitterness of
LINE 267: his self-condemnation for his inward feelings towards that innocent
LINE 268: being, his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his
LINE 269: nature (for it was not a generous one), though partly guessed at by
LINE 270: those who knew him, could be known to God and his own heart alone;—so
LINE 271: also was the hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return to
LINE 272: the vice of his youth, and seek oblivion for past calamities, and
LINE 273: deadness to the present misery of a blighted heart a joyless,
LINE 274: friendless life, and a morbidly disconsolate mind, by yielding again to
LINE 275: that insidious foe to health, and sense, and virtue, which had so
LINE 276: deplorably enslaved and degraded him before.
LINE 277: The second object of his choice was widely different from the first.
LINE 278: Some wondered at his taste; some even ridiculed it—but in this their
LINE 279: folly was more apparent than his. The lady was about his own
LINE 280: age—_i.e._, between thirty and forty—remarkable neither for beauty, nor
LINE 281: wealth, nor brilliant accomplishments; nor any other thing that I ever
LINE 282: heard of, except genuine good sense, unswerving integrity, active
LINE 283: piety, warm-hearted benevolence, and a fund of cheerful spirits. These
LINE 284: qualities, however, as you may readily imagine, combined to render her
LINE 285: an excellent mother to the children, and an invaluable wife to his
LINE 286: lordship. _He_, with his usual self-depreciation, thought her a world
LINE 287: too good for him, and while he wondered at the kindness of Providence
LINE 288: in conferring such a gift upon him, and even at her taste in preferring
LINE 289: him to other men, he did his best to reciprocate the good she did him,
LINE 290: and so far succeeded that she was, and I believe still is, one of the
LINE 291: happiest and fondest wives in England; and all who question the good
LINE 292: taste of either partner may be thankful if _their_ respective
LINE 293: selections afford them half the genuine satisfaction in the end, or
LINE 294: repay their preference with affection half as lasting and sincere.
LINE 295: If you are at all interested in the fate of that low scoundrel,
LINE 296: Grimsby, I can only tell you that he went from bad to worse, sinking
LINE 297: from bathos to bathos of vice and villainy, consorting only with the
LINE 298: worst members of his club and the lowest dregs of society—happily for
LINE 299: the rest of the world—and at last met his end in a drunken brawl, from
LINE 300: the hands, it is said, of some brother scoundrel he had cheated at
LINE 301: play.
LINE 302: As for Mr. Hattersley, he had never wholly forgotten his resolution to
LINE 303: "come out from among them," and behave like a man and a Christian, and
LINE 304: the last illness and death of his once jolly friend Huntingdon so
LINE 305: deeply and seriously impressed him with the evil of their former
LINE 306: practices, that he never needed another lesson of the kind. Avoiding
LINE 307: the temptations of the town, he continued to pass his life in the
LINE 308: country, immersed in the usual pursuits of a hearty, active, country
LINE 309: gentleman; his occupations being those of farming, and breeding horses
LINE 310: and cattle, diversified with a little hunting and shooting, and
LINE 311: enlivened by the occasional companionship of his friends (better
LINE 312: friends than those of his youth), and the society of his happy little
LINE 313: wife (now cheerful and confiding as heart could wish), and his fine
LINE 314: family of stalwart sons and blooming daughters. His father, the banker,
LINE 315: having died some years ago and left him all his riches, he has now full
LINE 316: scope for the exercise of his prevailing tastes, and I need not tell
LINE 317: you that Ralph Hattersley, Esq., is celebrated throughout the country
LINE 318: for his noble breed of horses.
