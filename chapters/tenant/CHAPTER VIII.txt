LINE 1: Six weeks had passed away. It was a splendid morning about the close of
LINE 2: June. Most of the hay was cut, but the last week had been very
LINE 3: unfavourable; and now that fine weather was come at last, being
LINE 4: determined to make the most of it, I had gathered all hands together
LINE 5: into the hay-field, and was working away myself, in the midst of them,
LINE 6: in my shirt-sleeves, with a light, shady straw hat on my head, catching
LINE 7: up armfuls of moist, reeking grass, and shaking it out to the four
LINE 8: winds of heaven, at the head of a goodly file of servants and
LINE 9: hirelings—intending so to labour, from morning till night, with as much
LINE 10: zeal and assiduity as I could look for from any of them, as well to
LINE 11: prosper the work by my own exertion as to animate the workers by my
LINE 12: example—when lo! my resolutions were overthrown in a moment, by the
LINE 13: simple fact of my brother's running up to me and putting into my hand a
LINE 14: small parcel, just arrived from London, which I had been for some time
LINE 15: expecting. I tore off the cover, and disclosed an elegant and portable
LINE 16: edition of "Marmion."
LINE 17: "I guess I know who that's for," said Fergus, who stood looking on
LINE 18: while I complacently examined the volume. "That's for Miss Eliza, now."
LINE 19: He pronounced this with a tone and look so prodigiously knowing, that I
LINE 20: was glad to contradict him.
LINE 21: "You're wrong, my lad," said I; and, taking up my coat, I deposited the
LINE 22: book in one of its pockets, and then put it on (_i.e._ the coat). "Now
LINE 23: come here, you idle dog, and make yourself useful for once," I
LINE 24: continued. "Pull off your coat, and take my place in the field till I
LINE 25: come back."
LINE 26: "Till you come back?—and where are you going, pray?"
LINE 27: "No matter—_where_—the _when_ is all that concerns you;—and I shall be
LINE 28: back by dinner, at least."
LINE 29: "Oh—oh! and I'm to labour away till then, am I?—and to keep all these
LINE 30: fellows hard at it besides? Well, well! I'll submit—for once in a
LINE 31: way.—Come, my lads, you must look sharp: _I_'m come to help you
LINE 32: now:—and woe be to that man, or woman either, that pauses for a moment
LINE 33: amongst you—whether to stare about him, to scratch his head, or blow
LINE 34: his nose—no pretext will serve—nothing but work, work, work in the
LINE 35: sweat of your face," &c., &c.
LINE 36: Leaving him thus haranguing the people, more to their amusement than
LINE 37: edification, I returned to the house, and, having made some alteration
LINE 38: in my toilet, hastened away to Wildfell Hall, with the book in my
LINE 39: pocket; for it was destined for the shelves of Mrs. Graham.
LINE 40: "What! then had she and you got on so well together as to come to the
LINE 41: giving and receiving of presents?"—Not precisely, old buck; this was my
LINE 42: first experiment in that line; and I was very anxious to see the result
LINE 43: of it.
LINE 44: We had met several times since the —— Bay excursion, and I had found
LINE 45: she was not averse to my company, provided I confined my conversation
LINE 46: to the discussion of abstract matters, or topics of common
LINE 47: interest;—the moment I touched upon the sentimental or the
LINE 48: complimentary, or made the slightest approach to tenderness in word or
LINE 49: look, I was not only punished by an immediate change in her manner at
LINE 50: the time, but doomed to find her more cold and distant, if not entirely
LINE 51: inaccessible, when next I sought her company. This circumstance did not
LINE 52: greatly disconcert me, however, because I attributed it, not so much to
LINE 53: any dislike of my person, as to some absolute resolution against a
LINE 54: second marriage formed prior to the time of our acquaintance, whether
LINE 55: from excess of affection for her late husband, or because she had had
LINE 56: enough of him and the matrimonial state together. At first, indeed, she
LINE 57: had seemed to take a pleasure in mortifying my vanity and crushing my
LINE 58: presumption—relentlessly nipping off bud by bud as they ventured to
LINE 59: appear; and then, I confess, I was deeply wounded, though, at the same
LINE 60: time, stimulated to seek revenge;—but latterly finding, beyond a doubt,
LINE 61: that I was not that empty-headed coxcomb she had first supposed me, she
LINE 62: had repulsed my modest advances in quite a different spirit. It was a
LINE 63: kind of serious, almost sorrowful displeasure, which I soon learnt
LINE 64: carefully to avoid awakening.
LINE 65: "Let me first establish my position as a friend," thought I—"the patron
LINE 66: and playfellow of her son, the sober, solid, plain-dealing friend of
LINE 67: herself, and then, when I have made myself fairly necessary to her
LINE 68: comfort and enjoyment in life (as I believe I can), we'll see what next
LINE 69: may be effected."
LINE 70: So we talked about painting, poetry, and music, theology, geology, and
LINE 71: philosophy: once or twice I lent her a book, and once she lent me one
LINE 72: in return: I met her in her walks as often as I could; I came to her
LINE 73: house as often as I dared. My first pretext for invading the sanctum
LINE 74: was to bring Arthur a little waddling puppy of which Sancho was the
LINE 75: father, and which delighted the child beyond expression, and,
LINE 76: consequently, could not fail to please his mamma. My second was to
LINE 77: bring him a book, which, knowing his mother's particularity, I had
LINE 78: carefully selected, and which I submitted for her approbation before
LINE 79: presenting it to him. Then, I brought her some plants for her garden,
LINE 80: in my sister's name—having previously persuaded Rose to send them. Each
LINE 81: of these times I inquired after the picture she was painting from the
LINE 82: sketch taken on the cliff, and was admitted into the studio, and asked
LINE 83: my opinion or advice respecting its progress.
LINE 84: My last visit had been to return the book she had lent me; and then it
LINE 85: was that, in casually discussing the poetry of Sir Walter Scott, she
LINE 86: had expressed a wish to see "Marmion," and I had conceived the
LINE 87: presumptuous idea of making her a present of it, and, on my return
LINE 88: home, instantly sent for the smart little volume I had this morning
LINE 89: received. But an apology for invading the hermitage was still
LINE 90: necessary; so I had furnished myself with a blue morocco collar for
LINE 91: Arthur's little dog; and that being given and received, with much more
LINE 92: joy and gratitude, on the part of the receiver, than the worth of the
LINE 93: gift or the selfish motive of the giver deserved, I ventured to ask
LINE 94: Mrs. Graham for one more look at the picture, if it was still there.
LINE 95: "Oh, yes! come in," said she (for I had met them in the garden). "It is
LINE 96: finished and framed, all ready for sending away; but give me your last
LINE 97: opinion, and if you can suggest any further improvement, it shall
LINE 98: be—duly considered, at least."
LINE 99: The picture was strikingly beautiful; it was the very scene itself,
LINE 100: transferred as if by magic to the canvas; but I expressed my
LINE 101: approbation in guarded terms, and few words, for fear of displeasing
LINE 102: her. She, however, attentively watched my looks, and her artist's pride
LINE 103: was gratified, no doubt, to read my heartfelt admiration in my eyes.
LINE 104: But, while I gazed, I thought upon the book, and wondered how it was to
LINE 105: be presented. My heart failed me; but I determined not to be such a
LINE 106: fool as to come away without having made the attempt. It was useless
LINE 107: waiting for an opportunity, and useless trying to concoct a speech for
LINE 108: the occasion. The more plainly and naturally the thing was done, the
LINE 109: better, I thought; so I just looked out of the window to screw up my
LINE 110: courage, and then pulled out the book, turned round, and put it into
LINE 111: her hand, with this short explanation:
LINE 112: "You were wishing to see "Marmion," Mrs. Graham; and here it is, if you
LINE 113: will be so kind as to take it."
LINE 114: A momentary blush suffused her face—perhaps, a blush of sympathetic
LINE 115: shame for such an awkward style of presentation: she gravely examined
LINE 116: the volume on both sides; then silently turned over the leaves,
LINE 117: knitting her brows the while, in serious cogitation; then closed the
LINE 118: book, and turning from it to me, quietly asked the price of it—I felt
LINE 119: the hot blood rush to my face.
LINE 120: "I'm sorry to offend you, Mr. Markham," said she, "but unless I pay for
LINE 121: the book, I cannot take it." And she laid it on the table.
LINE 122: "Why cannot you?"
LINE 123: "Because,"—she paused, and looked at the carpet.
LINE 124: "Why cannot you?" I repeated, with a degree of irascibility that roused
LINE 125: her to lift her eyes and look me steadily in the face.
LINE 126: "Because I don't like to put myself under obligations that I can never
LINE 127: repay—I _am_ obliged to you already for your kindness to my son; but
LINE 128: his grateful affection and your own good feelings must reward you for
LINE 129: that."
LINE 130: "Nonsense!" ejaculated I.
LINE 131: She turned her eyes on me again, with a look of quiet, grave surprise,
LINE 132: that had the effect of a rebuke, whether intended for such or not.
LINE 133: "Then you won't take the book?" I asked, more mildly than I had yet
LINE 134: spoken.
LINE 135: "I will gladly take it, if you will let me pay for it." I told her the
LINE 136: exact price, and the cost of the carriage besides, in as calm a tone as
LINE 137: I could command—for, in fact, I was ready to weep with disappointment
LINE 138: and vexation.
LINE 139: She produced her purse, and coolly counted out the money, but hesitated
LINE 140: to put it into my hand. Attentively regarding me, in a tone of soothing
LINE 141: softness, she observed,—"You think yourself insulted, Mr Markham—I wish
LINE 142: I could make you understand that—that I—"
LINE 143: "I do understand you, perfectly," I said. "You think that if you were
LINE 144: to accept that trifle from me now, I should presume upon it hereafter;
LINE 145: but you are mistaken:—if you will only oblige me by taking it, believe
LINE 146: me, I shall build no hopes upon it, and consider this no precedent for
LINE 147: future favours:—and it is nonsense to talk about putting yourself under
LINE 148: obligations to me when you must know that in such a case the obligation
LINE 149: is entirely on my side,—the favour on yours."
LINE 150: "Well, then, I'll take you at your word," she answered, with a most
LINE 151: angelic smile, returning the odious money to her purse—"but
LINE 152: _remember!_"
LINE 153: "I will remember—what I have said;—but do not you punish my presumption
LINE 154: by withdrawing your friendship entirely from me,—or expect me to atone
LINE 155: for it by being _more_ distant than before," said I, extending my hand
LINE 156: to take leave, for I was too much excited to remain.
LINE 157: "Well, then! let us be as we were," replied she, frankly placing her
LINE 158: hand in mine; and while I held it there, I had much difficulty to
LINE 159: refrain from pressing it to my lips;—but that would be suicidal
LINE 160: madness: I had been bold enough already, and this premature offering
LINE 161: had well-nigh given the death-blow to my hopes.
LINE 162: It was with an agitated, burning heart and brain that I hurried
LINE 163: homewards, regardless of that scorching noonday sun—forgetful of
LINE 164: everything but her I had just left—regretting nothing but her
LINE 165: impenetrability, and my own precipitancy and want of tact—fearing
LINE 166: nothing but her hateful resolution, and my inability to overcome
LINE 167: it—hoping nothing—but halt,—I will not bore you with my conflicting
LINE 168: hopes and fears—my serious cogitations and resolves.
