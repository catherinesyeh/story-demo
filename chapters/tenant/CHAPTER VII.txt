LINE 1: Not many days after this, on a mild sunny morning—rather soft under
LINE 2: foot; for the last fall of snow was only just wasted away, leaving yet
LINE 3: a thin ridge, here and there, lingering on the fresh green grass
LINE 4: beneath the hedges; but beside them already, the young primroses were
LINE 5: peeping from among their moist, dark foliage, and the lark above was
LINE 6: singing of summer, and hope, and love, and every heavenly thing—I was
LINE 7: out on the hill-side, enjoying these delights, and looking after the
LINE 8: well-being of my young lambs and their mothers, when, on glancing round
LINE 9: me, I beheld three persons ascending from the vale below. They were
LINE 10: Eliza Millward, Fergus, and Rose; so I crossed the field to meet them;
LINE 11: and, being told they were going to Wildfell Hall, I declared myself
LINE 12: willing to go with them, and offering my arm to Eliza, who readily
LINE 13: accepted it in lieu of my brother's, told the latter he might go back,
LINE 14: for I would accompany the ladies.
LINE 15: "I beg _your_ pardon!" exclaimed he. "It's the ladies that are
LINE 16: accompanying me, not I them. You had all had a peep at this wonderful
LINE 17: stranger but me, and I could endure my wretched ignorance no
LINE 18: longer—come what would, I must be satisfied; so I begged Rose to go
LINE 19: with me to the Hall, and introduce me to her at once. She swore she
LINE 20: would not, unless Miss Eliza would go too; so I ran to the vicarage and
LINE 21: fetched her; and we've come hooked all the way, as fond as a pair of
LINE 22: lovers—and now you've taken her from me; and you want to deprive me of
LINE 23: my walk and my visit besides. Go back to your fields and your cattle,
LINE 24: you lubberly fellow; you're not fit to associate with ladies and
LINE 25: gentlemen like us, that have nothing to do but to run snooking about to
LINE 26: our neighbours' houses, peeping into their private corners, and
LINE 27: scenting out their secrets, and picking holes in their coats, when we
LINE 28: don't find them ready made to our hands—you don't understand such
LINE 29: refined sources of enjoyment."
LINE 30: "Can't you both go?" suggested Eliza, disregarding the latter half of
LINE 31: the speech.
LINE 32: "Yes, both, to be sure!" cried Rose; "the more the merrier—and I'm sure
LINE 33: we shall want all the cheerfulness we can carry with us to that great,
LINE 34: dark, gloomy room, with its narrow latticed windows, and its dismal old
LINE 35: furniture—unless she shows us into her studio again."
LINE 36: So we went all in a body; and the meagre old maid-servant, that opened
LINE 37: the door, ushered us into an apartment such as Rose had described to me
LINE 38: as the scene of her first introduction to Mrs. Graham, a tolerably
LINE 39: spacious and lofty room, but obscurely lighted by the old-fashioned
LINE 40: windows, the ceiling, panels, and chimney-piece of grim black oak—the
LINE 41: latter elaborately but not very tastefully carved,—with tables and
LINE 42: chairs to match, an old bookcase on one side of the fire-place, stocked
LINE 43: with a motley assemblage of books, and an elderly cabinet piano on the
LINE 44: other.
LINE 45: The lady was seated in a stiff, high-backed arm-chair, with a small
LINE 46: round table, containing a desk and a work-basket on one side of her,
LINE 47: and her little boy on the other, who stood leaning his elbow on her
LINE 48: knee, and reading to her, with wonderful fluency, from a small volume
LINE 49: that lay in her lap; while she rested her hand on his shoulder, and
LINE 50: abstractedly played with the long, wavy curls that fell on his ivory
LINE 51: neck. They struck me as forming a pleasing contrast to all the
LINE 52: surrounding objects; but of course their position was immediately
LINE 53: changed on our entrance. I could only observe the picture during the
LINE 54: few brief seconds that Rachel held the door for our admittance.
LINE 55: I do not think Mrs. Graham was particularly delighted to see us: there
LINE 56: was something indescribably chilly in her quiet, calm civility; but I
LINE 57: did not talk much to her. Seating myself near the window, a little back
LINE 58: from the circle, I called Arthur to me, and he and I and Sancho amused
LINE 59: ourselves very pleasantly together, while the two young ladies baited
LINE 60: his mother with small talk, and Fergus sat opposite with his legs
LINE 61: crossed and his hands in his breeches-pockets, leaning back in his
LINE 62: chair, and staring now up at the ceiling, now straight forward at his
LINE 63: hostess (in a manner that made me strongly inclined to kick him out of
LINE 64: the room), now whistling sotto voce to himself a snatch of a favourite
LINE 65: air, now interrupting the conversation, or filling up a pause (as the
LINE 66: case might be) with some most impertinent question or remark. At one
LINE 67: time it was,—"It, amazes me, Mrs. Graham, how you could choose such a
LINE 68: dilapidated, rickety old place as this to live in. If you couldn't
LINE 69: afford to occupy the whole house, and have it mended up, why couldn't
LINE 70: you take a neat little cottage?"
LINE 71: "Perhaps I was too proud, Mr. Fergus," replied she, smiling; "perhaps I
LINE 72: took a particular fancy for this romantic, old-fashioned place—but,
LINE 73: indeed, it has many advantages over a cottage—in the first place, you
LINE 74: see, the rooms are larger and more airy; in the second place, the
LINE 75: unoccupied apartments, which I don't pay for, may serve as
LINE 76: lumber-rooms, if I have anything to put in them; and they are very
LINE 77: useful for my little boy to run about in on rainy days when he can't go
LINE 78: out; and then there is the garden for him to play in, and for me to
LINE 79: work in. You see I have effected some little improvement already,"
LINE 80: continued she, turning to the window. "There is a bed of young
LINE 81: vegetables in that corner, and here are some snowdrops and primroses
LINE 82: already in bloom—and there, too, is a yellow crocus just opening in the
LINE 83: sunshine."
LINE 84: "But then how can you bear such a situation—your nearest neighbours two
LINE 85: miles distant, and nobody looking in or passing by? Rose would go stark
LINE 86: mad in such a place. She can't put on life unless she sees half a dozen
LINE 87: fresh gowns and bonnets a day—not to speak of the faces within; but you
LINE 88: might sit watching at these windows all day long, and never see so much
LINE 89: as an old woman carrying her eggs to market."
LINE 90: "I am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief
LINE 91: recommendations. I take no pleasure in watching people pass the
LINE 92: windows; and I like to be quiet."
LINE 93: "Oh! as good as to say you wish we would all of us mind our own
LINE 94: business, and let you alone."
LINE 95: "No, I dislike an extensive acquaintance; but if I have a few friends,
LINE 96: of course I am glad to see them occasionally. No one can be happy in
LINE 97: eternal solitude. Therefore, Mr. Fergus, if you choose to enter my
LINE 98: house as a friend, I will make you welcome; if not, I must confess, I
LINE 99: would rather you kept away." She then turned and addressed some
LINE 100: observation to Rose or Eliza.
LINE 101: "And, Mrs. Graham," said he again, five minutes after, "we were
LINE 102: disputing, as we came along, a question that you can readily decide for
LINE 103: us, as it mainly regarded yourself—and, indeed, we often hold
LINE 104: discussions about you; for some of us have nothing better to do than to
LINE 105: talk about our neighbours' concerns, and we, the indigenous plants of
LINE 106: the soil, have known each other so long, and talked each other over so
LINE 107: often, that we are quite sick of that game; so that a stranger coming
LINE 108: amongst us makes an invaluable addition to our exhausted sources of
LINE 109: amusement. Well, the question, or questions, you are requested to
LINE 110: solve—"
LINE 111: "Hold your tongue, Fergus!" cried Rose, in a fever of apprehension and
LINE 112: wrath.
LINE 113: "I won't, I tell you. The questions you are requested to solve are
LINE 114: these:—First, concerning your birth, extraction, and previous
LINE 115: residence. Some will have it that you are a foreigner, and some an
LINE 116: Englishwoman; some a native of the north country, and some of the
LINE 117: south; some say—"
LINE 118: "Well, Mr. Fergus, I'll tell you. I'm an Englishwoman—and I don't see
LINE 119: why any one should doubt it—and I was born in the country, neither in
LINE 120: the extreme north nor south of our happy isle; and in the country I
LINE 121: have chiefly passed my life, and now I hope you are satisfied; for I am
LINE 122: not disposed to answer any more questions at present."
LINE 123: "Except this—"
LINE 124: "No, not one more!" laughed she, and, instantly quitting her seat, she
LINE 125: sought refuge at the window by which I was seated, and, in very
LINE 126: desperation, to escape my brother's persecutions, endeavoured to draw
LINE 127: me into conversation.
LINE 128: "Mr. Markham," said she, her rapid utterance and heightened colour too
LINE 129: plainly evincing her disquietude, "have you forgotten the fine sea-view
LINE 130: we were speaking of some time ago? I think I must trouble you, now, to
LINE 131: tell me the nearest way to it; for if this beautiful weather continue,
LINE 132: I shall, perhaps, be able to walk there, and take my sketch; I have
LINE 133: exhausted every other subject for painting; and I long to see it."
LINE 134: I was about to comply with her request, but Rose would not suffer me to
LINE 135: proceed.
LINE 136: "Oh, don't tell her, Gilbert!" cried she; "she shall go with us. It's
LINE 137: —— Bay you are thinking about, I suppose, Mrs. Graham? It is a very
LINE 138: long walk, too far for you, and out of the question for Arthur. But we
LINE 139: were thinking about making a picnic to see it some fine day; and, if
LINE 140: you will wait till the settled fine weather comes, I'm sure we shall
LINE 141: all be delighted to have you amongst us."
LINE 142: Poor Mrs. Graham looked dismayed, and attempted to make excuses, but
LINE 143: Rose, either compassionating her lonely life, or anxious to cultivate
LINE 144: her acquaintance, was determined to have her; and every objection was
LINE 145: overruled. She was told it would only be a small party, and all
LINE 146: friends, and that the best view of all was from —— Cliffs, full five
LINE 147: miles distant.
LINE 148: "Just a nice walk for the gentlemen," continued Rose; "but the ladies
LINE 149: will drive and walk by turns; for we shall have our pony-carriage,
LINE 150: which will be plenty large enough to contain little Arthur and three
LINE 151: ladies, together with your sketching apparatus, and our provisions."
LINE 152: So the proposal was finally acceded to; and, after some further
LINE 153: discussion respecting the time and manner of the projected excursion,
LINE 154: we rose, and took our leave.
LINE 155: But this was only March: a cold, wet April, and two weeks of May passed
LINE 156: over before we could venture forth on our expedition with the
LINE 157: reasonable hope of obtaining that pleasure we sought in pleasant
LINE 158: prospects, cheerful society, fresh air, good cheer and exercise,
LINE 159: without the alloy of bad roads, cold winds, or threatening clouds.
LINE 160: Then, on a glorious morning, we gathered our forces and set forth. The
LINE 161: company consisted of Mrs. and Master Graham, Mary and Eliza Millward,
LINE 162: Jane and Richard Wilson, and Rose, Fergus, and Gilbert Markham.
LINE 163: Mr. Lawrence had been invited to join us, but, for some reason best
LINE 164: known to himself, had refused to give us his company. I had solicited
LINE 165: the favour myself. When I did so, he hesitated, and asked who were
LINE 166: going. Upon my naming Miss Wilson among the rest, he seemed half
LINE 167: inclined to go, but when I mentioned Mrs. Graham, thinking it might be
LINE 168: a further inducement, it appeared to have a contrary effect, and he
LINE 169: declined it altogether, and, to confess the truth, the decision was not
LINE 170: displeasing to me, though I could scarcely tell you why.
LINE 171: It was about midday when we reached the place of our destination. Mrs.
LINE 172: Graham walked all the way to the cliffs; and little Arthur walked the
LINE 173: greater part of it too; for he was now much more hardy and active than
LINE 174: when he first entered the neighbourhood, and he did not like being in
LINE 175: the carriage with strangers, while all his four friends, mamma, and
LINE 176: Sancho, and Mr. Markham, and Miss Millward, were on foot, journeying
LINE 177: far behind, or passing through distant fields and lanes.
LINE 178: I have a very pleasant recollection of that walk, along the hard,
LINE 179: white, sunny road, shaded here and there with bright green trees, and
LINE 180: adorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious
LINE 181: fragrance; or through pleasant fields and lanes, all glorious in the
LINE 182: sweet flowers and brilliant verdure of delightful May. It was true,
LINE 183: Eliza was not beside me; but she was with her friends in the
LINE 184: pony-carriage, as happy, I trusted, as I was; and even when we
LINE 185: pedestrians, having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the
LINE 186: fields, beheld the little carriage far away, disappearing amid the
LINE 187: green, embowering trees, I did not hate those trees for snatching the
LINE 188: dear little bonnet and shawl from my sight, nor did I feel that all
LINE 189: those intervening objects lay between my happiness and me; for, to
LINE 190: confess the truth, I was too happy in the company of Mrs. Graham to
LINE 191: regret the absence of Eliza Millward.
LINE 192: The former, it is true, was most provokingly unsociable at
LINE 193: first—seemingly bent upon talking to no one but Mary Millward and
LINE 194: Arthur. She and Mary journeyed along together, generally with the child
LINE 195: between them;—but where the road permitted, I always walked on the
LINE 196: other side of her, Richard Wilson taking the other side of Miss
LINE 197: Millward, and Fergus roving here and there according to his fancy; and,
LINE 198: after a while, she became more friendly, and at length I succeeded in
LINE 199: securing her attention almost entirely to myself—and then I was happy
LINE 200: indeed; for whenever she did condescend to converse, I liked to listen.
LINE 201: Where her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme
LINE 202: good sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where
LINE 203: they differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal
LINE 204: or defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that
LINE 205: piqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or
LINE 206: looks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me
LINE 207: the more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed
LINE 208: her, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in
LINE 209: her eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.
LINE 210: At length our walk was ended. The increasing height and boldness of the
LINE 211: hills had for some time intercepted the prospect; but, on gaining the
LINE 212: summit of a steep acclivity, and looking downward, an opening lay
LINE 213: before us—and the blue sea burst upon our sight!—deep violet blue—not
LINE 214: deadly calm, but covered with glinting breakers—diminutive white specks
LINE 215: twinkling on its bosom, and scarcely to be distinguished, by the
LINE 216: keenest vision, from the little seamews that sported above, their white
LINE 217: wings glittering in the sunshine: only one or two vessels were visible,
LINE 218: and those were far away.
LINE 219: I looked at my companion to see what she thought of this glorious
LINE 220: scene. She said nothing: but she stood still, and fixed her eyes upon
LINE 221: it with a gaze that assured me she was not disappointed. She had very
LINE 222: fine eyes, by-the-by—I don't know whether I have told you before, but
LINE 223: they were full of soul, large, clear, and nearly black—not brown, but
LINE 224: very dark grey. A cool, reviving breeze blew from the sea—soft, pure,
LINE 225: salubrious: it waved her drooping ringlets, and imparted a livelier
LINE 226: colour to her usually too pallid lip and cheek. She felt its
LINE 227: exhilarating influence, and so did I—I felt it tingling through my
LINE 228: frame, but dared not give way to it while she remained so quiet. There
LINE 229: was an aspect of subdued exhilaration in her face, that kindled into
LINE 230: almost a smile of exalted, glad intelligence as her eye met mine. Never
LINE 231: had she looked so lovely: never had my heart so warmly cleaved to her
LINE 232: as now. Had we been left two minutes longer standing there alone, I
LINE 233: cannot answer for the consequences. Happily for my discretion, perhaps
LINE 234: for my enjoyment during the remainder of the day, we were speedily
LINE 235: summoned to the repast—a very respectable collation, which Rose,
LINE 236: assisted by Miss Wilson and Eliza, who, having shared her seat in the
LINE 237: carriage, had arrived with her a little before the rest, had set out
LINE 238: upon an elevated platform overlooking the sea, and sheltered from the
LINE 239: hot sun by a shelving rock and overhanging trees.
LINE 240: Mrs. Graham seated herself at a distance from me. Eliza was my nearest
LINE 241: neighbour. She exerted herself to be agreeable, in her gentle,
LINE 242: unobtrusive way, and was, no doubt, as fascinating and charming as
LINE 243: ever, if I could only have felt it. But soon my heart began to warm
LINE 244: towards her once again; and we were all very merry and happy
LINE 245: together—as far as I could see—throughout the protracted social meal.
LINE 246: When that was over, Rose summoned Fergus to help her to gather up the
LINE 247: fragments, and the knives, dishes, &c., and restore them to the
LINE 248: baskets; and Mrs. Graham took her camp-stool and drawing materials; and
LINE 249: having begged Miss Millward to take charge of her precious son, and
LINE 250: strictly enjoined him not to wander from his new guardian's side, she
LINE 251: left us and proceeded along the steep, stony hill, to a loftier, more
LINE 252: precipitous eminence at some distance, whence a still finer prospect
LINE 253: was to be had, where she preferred taking her sketch, though some of
LINE 254: the ladies told her it was a frightful place, and advised her not to
LINE 255: attempt it.
LINE 256: When she was gone, I felt as if there was to be no more fun—though it
LINE 257: is difficult to say what she had contributed to the hilarity of the
LINE 258: party. No jests, and little laughter, had escaped her lips; but her
LINE 259: smile had animated my mirth; a keen observation or a cheerful word from
LINE 260: her had insensibly sharpened my wits, and thrown an interest over all
LINE 261: that was done and said by the rest. Even my conversation with Eliza had
LINE 262: been enlivened by her presence, though I knew it not; and now that she
LINE 263: was gone, Eliza's playful nonsense ceased to amuse me—nay, grew
LINE 264: wearisome to my soul, and I grew weary of amusing her: I felt myself
LINE 265: drawn by an irresistible attraction to that distant point where the
LINE 266: fair artist sat and plied her solitary task—and not long did I attempt
LINE 267: to resist it: while my little neighbour was exchanging a few words with
LINE 268: Miss Wilson, I rose and cannily slipped away. A few rapid strides, and
LINE 269: a little active clambering, soon brought me to the place where she was
LINE 270: seated—a narrow ledge of rock at the very verge of the cliff, which
LINE 271: descended with a steep, precipitous slant, quite down to the rocky
LINE 272: shore.
LINE 273: She did not hear me coming: the falling of my shadow across her paper
LINE 274: gave her an electric start; and she looked hastily round—any other lady
LINE 275: of my acquaintance would have screamed under such a sudden alarm.
LINE 276: "Oh! I didn't know it was you.—Why did you startle me so?" said she,
LINE 277: somewhat testily. "I hate anybody to come upon me so unexpectedly."
LINE 278: "Why, what did you take me for?" said I: "if I had known you were so
LINE 279: nervous, I would have been more cautious; but—"
LINE 280: "Well, never mind. What did you come for? are they all coming?"
LINE 281: "No; this little ledge could scarcely contain them all."
LINE 282: "I'm glad, for I'm tired of talking."
LINE 283: "Well, then, I won't talk. I'll only sit and watch your drawing."
LINE 284: "Oh, but you know I don't like that."
LINE 285: "Then I'll content myself with admiring this magnificent prospect."
LINE 286: She made no objection to this; and, for some time, sketched away in
LINE 287: silence. But I could not help stealing a glance, now and then, from the
LINE 288: splendid view at our feet to the elegant white hand that held the
LINE 289: pencil, and the graceful neck and glossy raven curls that drooped over
LINE 290: the paper.
LINE 291: "Now," thought I, "if I had but a pencil and a morsel of paper, I could
LINE 292: make a lovelier sketch than hers, admitting I had the power to
LINE 293: delineate faithfully what is before me."
LINE 294: But, though this satisfaction was denied me, I was very well content to
LINE 295: sit beside her there, and say nothing.
LINE 296: "Are you there still, Mr. Markham?" said she at length, looking round
LINE 297: upon me—for I was seated a little behind on a mossy projection of the
LINE 298: cliff.—"Why don't you go and amuse yourself with your friends?"
LINE 299: "Because I am tired of them, like you; and I shall have enough of them
LINE 300: to-morrow—or at any time hence; but you I may not have the pleasure of
LINE 301: seeing again for I know not how long."
LINE 302: "What was Arthur doing when you came away?"
LINE 303: "He was with Miss Millward, where you left him—all right, but hoping
LINE 304: mamma would not be long away. You didn't intrust him to me, by-the-by,"
LINE 305: I grumbled, "though I had the honour of a much longer acquaintance; but
LINE 306: Miss Millward has the art of conciliating and amusing children," I
LINE 307: carelessly added, "if she is good for nothing else."
LINE 308: "Miss Millward has many estimable qualities, which such as you cannot
LINE 309: be expected to perceive or appreciate. Will you tell Arthur that I
LINE 310: shall come in a few minutes?"
LINE 311: "If that be the case, I will wait, with your permission, till those few
LINE 312: minutes are past; and then I can assist you to descend this difficult
LINE 313: path."
LINE 314: "Thank you—I always manage best, on such occasions, without
LINE 315: assistance."
LINE 316: "But, at least, I can carry your stool and sketch-book."
LINE 317: She did not deny me this favour; but I was rather offended at her
LINE 318: evident desire to be rid of me, and was beginning to repent of my
LINE 319: pertinacity, when she somewhat appeased me by consulting my taste and
LINE 320: judgment about some doubtful matter in her drawing. My opinion,
LINE 321: happily, met her approbation, and the improvement I suggested was
LINE 322: adopted without hesitation.
LINE 323: "I have often wished in vain," said she, "for another's judgment to
LINE 324: appeal to when I could scarcely trust the direction of my own eye and
LINE 325: head, they having been so long occupied with the contemplation of a
LINE 326: single object as to become almost incapable of forming a proper idea
LINE 327: respecting it."
LINE 328: "That," replied I, "is only one of many evils to which a solitary life
LINE 329: exposes us."
LINE 330: "True," said she; and again we relapsed into silence.
LINE 331: About two minutes after, however, she declared her sketch completed,
LINE 332: and closed the book.
LINE 333: On returning to the scene of our repast we found all the company had
LINE 334: deserted it, with the exception of three—Mary Millward, Richard Wilson,
LINE 335: and Arthur Graham. The younger gentleman lay fast asleep with his head
LINE 336: pillowed on the lady's lap; the other was seated beside her with a
LINE 337: pocket edition of some classic author in his hand. He never went
LINE 338: anywhere without such a companion wherewith to improve his leisure
LINE 339: moments: all time seemed lost that was not devoted to study, or
LINE 340: exacted, by his physical nature, for the bare support of life. Even now
LINE 341: he could not abandon himself to the enjoyment of that pure air and
LINE 342: balmy sunshine—that splendid prospect, and those soothing sounds, the
LINE 343: music of the waves and of the soft wind in the sheltering trees above
LINE 344: him—not even with a lady by his side (though not a very charming one, I
LINE 345: will allow)—he must pull out his book, and make the most of his time
LINE 346: while digesting his temperate meal, and reposing his weary limbs,
LINE 347: unused to so much exercise.
LINE 348: Perhaps, however, he spared a moment to exchange a word or a glance
LINE 349: with his companion now and then—at any rate, she did not appear at all
LINE 350: resentful of his conduct; for her homely features wore an expression of
LINE 351: unusual cheerfulness and serenity, and she was studying his pale,
LINE 352: thoughtful face with great complacency when we arrived.
LINE 353: The journey homeward was by no means so agreeable to me as the former
LINE 354: part of the day: for now Mrs. Graham was in the carriage, and Eliza
LINE 355: Millward was the companion of my walk. She had observed my preference
LINE 356: for the young widow, and evidently felt herself neglected. She did not
LINE 357: manifest her chagrin by keen reproaches, bitter sarcasms, or pouting
LINE 358: sullen silence—any or all of these I could easily have endured, or
LINE 359: lightly laughed away; but she showed it by a kind of gentle melancholy,
LINE 360: a mild, reproachful sadness that cut me to the heart. I tried to cheer
LINE 361: her up, and apparently succeeded in some degree, before the walk was
LINE 362: over; but in the very act my conscience reproved me, knowing, as I did,
LINE 363: that, sooner or later, the tie must be broken, and this was only
LINE 364: nourishing false hopes and putting off the evil day.
LINE 365: When the pony-carriage had approached as near Wildfell Hall as the road
LINE 366: would permit—unless, indeed, it proceeded up the long rough lane, which
LINE 367: Mrs. Graham would not allow—the young widow and her son alighted,
LINE 368: relinquishing the driver's seat to Rose; and I persuaded Eliza to take
LINE 369: the latter's place. Having put her comfortably in, bid her take care of
LINE 370: the evening air, and wished her a kind good-night, I felt considerably
LINE 371: relieved, and hastened to offer my services to Mrs. Graham to carry her
LINE 372: apparatus up the fields, but she had already hung her camp-stool on her
LINE 373: arm and taken her sketch-book in her hand, and insisted upon bidding me
