LINE 1: December 20th, 1826.—The fifth anniversary of my wedding-day, and, I
LINE 2: trust, the last I shall spend under this roof. My resolution is formed,
LINE 3: my plan concocted, and already partly put in execution. My conscience
LINE 4: does not blame me, but while the purpose ripens let me beguile a few of
LINE 5: these long winter evenings in stating the case for my own satisfaction:
LINE 6: a dreary amusement enough, but having the air of a useful occupation,
LINE 7: and being pursued as a task, it will suit me better than a lighter one.
LINE 8: In September, quiet Grassdale was again alive with a party of ladies
LINE 9: and gentlemen (so called), consisting of the same individuals as those
LINE 10: invited the year before last, with the addition of two or three others,
LINE 11: among whom were Mrs. Hargrave and her younger daughter. The gentlemen
LINE 12: and Lady Lowborough were invited for the pleasure and convenience of
LINE 13: the host; the other ladies, I suppose, for the sake of appearances, and
LINE 14: to keep me in check, and make me discreet and civil in my demeanour.
LINE 15: But the ladies stayed only three weeks; the gentlemen, with two
LINE 16: exceptions, above two months: for their hospitable entertainer was loth
LINE 17: to part with them and be left alone with his bright intellect, his
LINE 18: stainless conscience, and his loved and loving wife.
LINE 19: On the day of Lady Lowborough's arrival, I followed her into her
LINE 20: chamber, and plainly told her that, if I found reason to believe that
LINE 21: she still continued her criminal connection with Mr. Huntingdon, I
LINE 22: should think it my absolute duty to inform her husband of the
LINE 23: circumstance—or awaken his suspicions at least—however painful it might
LINE 24: be, or however dreadful the consequences. She was startled at first by
LINE 25: the declaration, so unexpected, and so determinately yet calmly
LINE 26: delivered; but rallying in a moment, she coolly replied that, if I saw
LINE 27: anything at all reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct, she would
LINE 28: freely give me leave to tell his lordship all about it. Willing to be
LINE 29: satisfied with this, I left her; and certainly I saw nothing
LINE 30: thenceforth particularly reprehensible or suspicious in her demeanour
LINE 31: towards her host; but then I had the other guests to attend to, and I
LINE 32: did not watch them narrowly—for, to confess the truth, I _feared_ to
LINE 33: see anything between them. I no longer regarded it as any concern of
LINE 34: mine, and if it was my duty to enlighten Lord Lowborough, it was a
LINE 35: painful duty, and I dreaded to be called to perform it.
LINE 36: But my fears were brought to an end in a manner I had not anticipated.
LINE 37: One evening, about a fortnight after the visitors' arrival, I had
LINE 38: retired into the library to snatch a few minutes' respite from forced
LINE 39: cheerfulness and wearisome discourse, for after so long a period of
LINE 40: seclusion, dreary indeed as I had often found it, I could not always
LINE 41: bear to be doing violence to my feelings, and goading my powers to
LINE 42: talk, and smile and listen, and play the attentive hostess, or even the
LINE 43: cheerful friend: I had just ensconced myself within the bow of the
LINE 44: window, and was looking out upon the west, where the darkening hills
LINE 45: rose sharply defined against the clear amber light of evening, that
LINE 46: gradually blended and faded away into the pure, pale blue of the upper
LINE 47: sky, where one bright star was shining through, as if to promise—"When
LINE 48: that dying light is gone, the world will not be left in darkness, and
LINE 49: they who trust in God, whose minds are unbeclouded by the mists of
LINE 50: unbelief and sin, are never wholly comfortless,"—when I heard a hurried
LINE 51: step approaching, and Lord Lowborough entered. This room was still his
LINE 52: favourite resort. He flung the door to with unusual violence, and cast
LINE 53: his hat aside regardless where it fell. What could be the matter with
LINE 54: him? His face was ghastly pale; his eyes were fixed upon the ground;
LINE 55: his teeth clenched: his forehead glistened with the dews of agony. It
LINE 56: was plain he knew his wrongs at last!
LINE 57: Unconscious of my presence, he began to pace the room in a state of
LINE 58: fearful agitation, violently wringing his hands and uttering low groans
LINE 59: or incoherent ejaculations. I made a movement to let him know that he
LINE 60: was not alone; but he was too preoccupied to notice it. Perhaps, while
LINE 61: his back was towards me, I might cross the room and slip away
LINE 62: unobserved. I rose to make the attempt, but then he perceived me. He
LINE 63: started and stood still a moment; then wiped his streaming forehead,
LINE 64: and, advancing towards me, with a kind of unnatural composure, said in
LINE 65: a deep, almost sepulchral tone,—"Mrs. Huntingdon, I must leave you
LINE 66: to-morrow."
LINE 67: "To-morrow!" I repeated. "I do not ask the cause."
LINE 68: "You know it then, and you can be so calm!" said he, surveying me with
LINE 69: profound astonishment, not unmingled with a kind of resentful
LINE 70: bitterness, as it appeared to me.
LINE 71: "I have so long been aware of—" I paused in time, and added, "of my
LINE 72: husband's character, that nothing shocks me."
LINE 73: "But _this_—how long have you been aware of this?" demanded he, laying
LINE 74: his clenched hand on the table beside him, and looking me keenly and
LINE 75: fixedly in the face.
LINE 76: I felt like a criminal.
LINE 77: "Not long," I answered.
LINE 78: "You knew it!" cried he, with bitter vehemence—"and you did not tell
LINE 79: me! You helped to deceive me!"
LINE 80: "My lord, I did _not_ help to deceive you."
LINE 81: "Then why did you not tell me?"
LINE 82: "Because I knew it would be painful to you. I hoped she would return to
LINE 83: her duty, and then there would be no need to harrow your feelings with
LINE 84: such—"
LINE 85: "O God! how long has this been going on? How long has it been, Mrs.
LINE 86: Huntingdon?—Tell me—I MUST know!" exclaimed, with intense and fearful
LINE 87: eagerness.
LINE 88: "Two years, I believe."
LINE 89: "Great heaven! and she has duped me all this time!" He turned away with
LINE 90: a suppressed groan of agony, and paced the room again in a paroxysm of
LINE 91: renewed agitation. My heart smote me; but I would try to console him,
LINE 92: though I knew not how to attempt it.
LINE 93: "She is a wicked woman," I said. "She has basely deceived and betrayed
LINE 94: you. She is as little worthy of your regret as she was of your
LINE 95: affection. Let her injure you no further; abstract yourself from her,
LINE 96: and stand alone."
LINE 97: "And you, Madam," said he sternly, arresting himself, and turning round
LINE 98: upon me, "you have injured me too by this ungenerous concealment!"
LINE 99: There was a sudden revulsion in my feelings. Something rose within me,
LINE 100: and urged me to resent this harsh return for my heartfelt sympathy, and
LINE 101: defend myself with answering severity. Happily, I did not yield to the
LINE 102: impulse. I saw his anguish as, suddenly smiting his forehead, he turned
LINE 103: abruptly to the window, and, looking upward at the placid sky, murmured
LINE 104: passionately, "O God, that I might die!"—and felt that to add one drop
LINE 105: of bitterness to that already overflowing cup would be ungenerous
LINE 106: indeed. And yet I fear there was more coldness than gentleness in the
LINE 107: quiet tone of my reply:—"I might offer many excuses that some would
LINE 108: admit to be valid, but I will not attempt to enumerate them—"
LINE 109: "I know them," said he hastily: "you would say that it was no business
LINE 110: of yours: that I ought to have taken care of myself; that if my own
LINE 111: blindness has led me into this pit of hell, I have no right to blame
LINE 112: another for giving me credit for a larger amount of sagacity than I
LINE 113: possessed—"
LINE 114: "I confess I was wrong," continued I, without regarding this bitter
LINE 115: interruption; "but whether want of courage or mistaken kindness was the
LINE 116: cause of my error, I think you blame me too severely. I told Lady
LINE 117: Lowborough two weeks ago, the very hour she came, that I should
LINE 118: certainly think it my duty to inform you if she continued to deceive
LINE 119: you: she gave me full liberty to do so if I should see anything
LINE 120: reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct; I have seen nothing; and I
LINE 121: trusted she had altered her course."
LINE 122: He continued gazing from the window while I spoke, and did not answer,
LINE 123: but, stung by the recollections my words awakened, stamped his foot
LINE 124: upon the floor, ground his teeth, and corrugated his brow, like one
LINE 125: under the influence of acute physical pain.
LINE 126: "It was wrong, it was wrong!" he muttered at length. "Nothing can
LINE 127: excuse it; nothing can atone for it,—for nothing can recall those years
LINE 128: of cursed credulity; nothing obliterate them!—nothing, nothing!" he
LINE 129: repeated in a whisper, whose despairing bitterness precluded all
LINE 130: resentment.
LINE 131: "When I put the case to myself, I own it _was_ wrong," I answered; "but
LINE 132: I can only now regret that I did not see it in this light before, and
LINE 133: that, as you say, nothing can recall the past."
LINE 134: Something in my voice or in the spirit of this answer seemed to alter
LINE 135: his mood. Turning towards me, and attentively surveying my face by the
LINE 136: dim light, he said, in a milder tone than he had yet employed,—"You,
LINE 137: too, have suffered, I suppose."
LINE 138: "I suffered much, at first."
LINE 139: "When was that?"
LINE 140: "Two years ago; and two years hence you will be as calm as I am now,
LINE 141: and far, far happier, I trust, for you are a man, and free to act as
LINE 142: you please."
LINE 143: Something like a smile, but a _very_ bitter one, crossed his face for a
LINE 144: moment.
LINE 145: "You have not been happy, lately?" he said, with a kind of effort to
LINE 146: regain composure, and a determination to waive the further discussion
LINE 147: of his own calamity.
LINE 148: "Happy?" I repeated, almost provoked at such a question. "Could I be
LINE 149: so, with such a husband?"
LINE 150: "I have noticed a change in your appearance since the first years of
LINE 151: your marriage," pursued he: "I observed it to—to that infernal demon,"
LINE 152: he muttered between his teeth; "and he said it was your own sour temper
LINE 153: that was eating away your bloom: it was making you old and ugly before
LINE 154: your time, and had already made his fireside as comfortless as a
LINE 155: convent cell. You smile, Mrs. Huntingdon; nothing moves you. I wish my
LINE 156: nature were as calm as yours."
LINE 157: "My nature was not originally calm," said I. "I have learned to appear
LINE 158: so by dint of hard lessons and many repeated efforts."
LINE 159: At this juncture Mr. Hattersley burst into the room.
LINE 160: "Hallo, Lowborough!" he began—"Oh! I beg your pardon," he exclaimed on
LINE 161: seeing me. "I didn't know it was a _tête-à-tête_. Cheer up, man," he
LINE 162: continued, giving Lord Lowborough a thump on the back, which caused the
LINE 163: latter to recoil from him with looks of ineffable disgust and
LINE 164: irritation. "Come, I want to speak with you a bit."
LINE 165: "Speak, then."
LINE 166: "But I'm not sure it would be quite agreeable to the lady what I have
LINE 167: to say."
LINE 168: "Then it would not be agreeable to me," said his lordship, turning to
LINE 169: leave the room.
LINE 170: "Yes, it would," cried the other, following him into the hall. "If
LINE 171: you've the heart of a man, it would be the very ticket for you. It's
LINE 172: just this, my lad," he continued, rather lowering his voice, but not
LINE 173: enough to prevent me from hearing every word he said, though the
LINE 174: half-closed door stood between us. "I think you're an ill-used man—nay,
LINE 175: now, don't flare up; I don't want to offend you: it's only my rough way
LINE 176: of talking. I must speak right out, you _know_, or else not at all; and
LINE 177: I'm come—stop now! let me explain—I'm come to offer you my services,
LINE 178: for though Huntingdon is my friend, he's a devilish scamp, as we all
LINE 179: know, and I'll be _your_ friend for the nonce. I know what it is you
LINE 180: want, to make matters straight: it's just to exchange a shot with him,
LINE 181: and then you'll feel yourself all right again; and if an accident
LINE 182: happens—why, that'll be all right too, I daresay, to a desperate fellow
LINE 183: like you. Come now, give me your hand, and don't look so black upon it.
LINE 184: Name time and place, and I'll manage the rest."
LINE 185: "That," answered the more low, deliberate voice of Lord Lowborough, "is
LINE 186: just the remedy my own heart, or the devil within it, suggested—to meet
LINE 187: him, and _not to sever without blood_. Whether I or he should fall, or
LINE 188: both, it would be an _inexpressible_ relief to me, if—"
LINE 189: "Just so! Well then,—"
LINE 190: "No!" exclaimed his lordship, with deep, determined emphasis. "Though I
LINE 191: hate him from my heart, and should rejoice at any calamity that could
LINE 192: befall him, I'll leave him to God; and though I abhor my own life, I'll
LINE 193: leave that, too, to Him that gave it."
LINE 194: "But you see, in this case," pleaded Hattersley—
LINE 195: "I'll not hear you!" exclaimed his companion, hastily turning away.
LINE 196: "Not another word! I've enough to do against the fiend within me."
LINE 197: "Then you're a white-livered fool, and I wash my hands of you,"
LINE 198: grumbled the tempter, as he swung himself round and departed.
LINE 199: "Right, right, Lord Lowborough," cried I, darting out and clasping his
LINE 200: burning hand, as he was moving away to the stairs. "I begin to think
LINE 201: the world is not worthy of you!" Not understanding this sudden
LINE 202: ebullition, he turned upon me with a stare of gloomy, bewildered
LINE 203: amazement, that made me ashamed of the impulse to which I had yielded;
LINE 204: but soon a more humanised expression dawned upon his countenance, and
LINE 205: before I could withdraw my hand, he pressed it kindly, while a gleam of
LINE 206: genuine feeling flashed from his eyes as he murmured, "God help us
LINE 207: both!"
LINE 208: "Amen!" responded I; and we parted.
LINE 209: I returned to the drawing-room, where, doubtless, my presence would be
LINE 210: expected by most, desired by one or two. In the ante-room was Mr.
LINE 211: Hattersley, railing against Lord Lowborough's poltroonery before a
LINE 212: select audience, viz. Mr. Huntingdon, who was lounging against the
LINE 213: table, exulting in his own treacherous villainy, and laughing his
LINE 214: victim to scorn, and Mr. Grimsby, standing by, quietly rubbing his
LINE 215: hands and chuckling with fiendish satisfaction.
LINE 216: In the drawing-room I found Lady Lowborough, evidently in no very
LINE 217: enviable state of mind, and struggling hard to conceal her discomposure
LINE 218: by an overstrained affectation of unusual cheerfulness and vivacity,
LINE 219: very uncalled-for under the circumstances, for she had herself given
LINE 220: the company to understand that her husband had received unpleasant
LINE 221: intelligence from home, which necessitated his immediate departure, and
LINE 222: that he had suffered it so to bother his mind that it had brought on a
LINE 223: bilious headache, owing to which, and the preparations he judged
LINE 224: necessary to hasten his departure, she believed they would not have the
LINE 225: pleasure of seeing him to-night. However, she asserted, it was only a
LINE 226: business concern, and so she did not intend it should trouble _her._
LINE 227: She was just saying this as I entered, and she darted upon me such a
LINE 228: glance of hardihood and defiance as at once astonished and revolted me.
LINE 229: "But I _am_ troubled," continued she, "and vexed too, for I think it my
LINE 230: duty to accompany his lordship, and of course I am very sorry to part
LINE 231: with all my kind friends so unexpectedly and so soon."
LINE 232: "And yet, Annabella," said Esther, who was sitting beside her, "I never
LINE 233: saw you in better spirits in my life."
LINE 234: "Precisely so, my love: because I wish to make the best of your
LINE 235: society, since it appears this is to be the last night I am to enjoy it
LINE 236: till heaven knows when; and I wish to leave a good impression on you
LINE 237: all,"—she glanced round, and seeing her aunt's eye fixed upon her,
LINE 238: rather too scrutinizingly, as she probably thought, she started up and
LINE 239: continued: "To which end I'll give you a song—shall I, aunt? shall I,
LINE 240: Mrs. Huntingdon? shall I ladies and gentlemen all? Very well. I'll do
LINE 241: my best to amuse you."
LINE 242: She and Lord Lowborough occupied the apartments next to mine. I know
LINE 243: not how _she_ passed the night, but I lay awake the greater part of it
LINE 244: listening to his heavy step pacing monotonously up and down his
LINE 245: dressing-room, which was nearest my chamber. Once I heard him pause and
LINE 246: throw something out of the window with a passionate ejaculation; and in
LINE 247: the morning, after they were gone, a keen-bladed clasp-knife was found
LINE 248: on the grass-plot below; a razor, likewise, was snapped in two and
LINE 249: thrust deep into the cinders of the grate, but partially corroded by
LINE 250: the decaying embers. So strong had been the temptation to end his
LINE 251: miserable life, so determined his resolution to resist it.
LINE 252: My heart bled for him as I lay listening to that ceaseless tread.
LINE 253: Hitherto I had thought too much of myself, too little of him: now I
LINE 254: forgot my own afflictions, and thought only of his; of the ardent
LINE 255: affection so miserably wasted, the fond faith so cruelly betrayed,
LINE 256: the—no, I will not attempt to enumerate his wrongs—but I hated his wife
LINE 257: and my husband more intensely than ever, and not for my sake, but for
LINE 258: his.
LINE 259: They departed early in the morning, before any one else was down,
LINE 260: except myself, and just as I was leaving my room Lord Lowborough was
LINE 261: descending to take his place in the carriage, where his lady was
LINE 262: already ensconced; and Arthur (or Mr. Huntingdon, as I prefer calling
LINE 263: him, for the other is my child's name) had the gratuitous insolence to
LINE 264: come out in his dressing-gown to bid his "friend" good-by.
LINE 265: "What, going already, Lowborough!" said he. "Well, good-morning." He
LINE 266: smilingly offered his hand.
LINE 267: I think the other would have knocked him down, had he not instinctively
LINE 268: started back before that bony fist quivering with rage and clenched
LINE 269: till the knuckles gleamed white and glistening through the skin.
LINE 270: Looking upon him with a countenance livid with furious hate, Lord
LINE 271: Lowborough muttered between his closed teeth a deadly execration he
LINE 272: would not have uttered had he been calm enough to choose his words, and
LINE 273: departed.
LINE 274: "I call that an unchristian spirit now," said the villain. "But I'd
LINE 275: never give up an old friend for the sake of a wife. You may have mine
LINE 276: if you like, and I call that handsome; I can do no more than offer
LINE 277: restitution, can I?"
LINE 278: But Lowborough had gained the bottom of the stairs, and was now
LINE 279: crossing the hall; and Mr. Huntingdon, leaning over the banisters,
LINE 280: called out, "Give my love to Annabella! and I wish you both a happy
LINE 281: journey," and withdrew, laughing, to his chamber.
LINE 282: He subsequently expressed himself rather glad she was gone. "She was so
LINE 283: deuced imperious and exacting," said he. "Now I shall be my own man
LINE 284: again, and feel rather more at my ease."
