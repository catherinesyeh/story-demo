LINE 1: Though Mr. Lawrence's health was now quite re-established, my visits to
LINE 2: Woodford were as unremitting as ever; though often less protracted than
LINE 3: before. We seldom _talked_ about Mrs. Huntingdon; but yet we never met
LINE 4: without mentioning her, for I never sought his company but with the
LINE 5: hope of hearing something about her, and he never sought mine at all,
LINE 6: because he saw me often enough without. But I always began to talk of
LINE 7: other things, and waited first to see if _he_ would introduce the
LINE 8: subject. If he did not, I would casually ask, "Have you heard from your
LINE 9: sister lately?" If he said "No," the matter was dropped: if he said
LINE 10: "Yes," I would venture to inquire, "How is she?" but never "How is her
LINE 11: husband?" though I might be burning to know; because I had not the
LINE 12: hypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his recovery, and I had not the
LINE 13: face to express any desire for a contrary result. Had I any such
LINE 14: desire?—I fear I must plead guilty; but since you have heard my
LINE 15: confession, you must hear my justification as well—a few of the
LINE 16: excuses, at least, wherewith I sought to pacify my own accusing
LINE 17: conscience.
LINE 18: In the first place, you see, his life did harm to others, and evidently
LINE 19: no good to himself; and though I wished it to terminate, I would not
LINE 20: have hastened its close if, by the lifting of a finger, I could have
LINE 21: done so, or if a spirit had whispered in my ear that a single effort of
LINE 22: the will would be enough,—unless, indeed, I had the power to exchange
LINE 23: him for some other victim of the grave, whose life might be of service
LINE 24: to his race, and whose death would be lamented by his friends. But was
LINE 25: there any harm in wishing that, among the many thousands whose souls
LINE 26: would certainly be required of them before the year was over, this
LINE 27: wretched mortal might be one? I thought not; and therefore I wished
LINE 28: with all my heart that it might please heaven to remove him to a better
LINE 29: world, or if that might not be, still to take him out of this; for if
LINE 30: he were unfit to answer the summons now, after a warning sickness, and
LINE 31: with such an angel by his side, it seemed but too certain that he never
LINE 32: would be—that, on the contrary, returning health would bring returning
LINE 33: lust and villainy, and as he grew more certain of recovery, more
LINE 34: accustomed to her generous goodness, his feelings would become more
LINE 35: callous, his heart more flinty and impervious to her persuasive
LINE 36: arguments—but God knew best. Meantime, however, I could not but be
LINE 37: anxious for the result of His decrees; knowing, as I did, that (leaving
LINE 38: myself entirely out of the question), however Helen might feel
LINE 39: interested in her husband's welfare, however she might deplore his
LINE 40: fate, still while he lived she must be miserable.
LINE 41: A fortnight passed away, and my inquiries were always answered in the
LINE 42: negative. At length a welcome "yes" drew from me the second question.
LINE 43: Lawrence divined my anxious thoughts, and appreciated my reserve. I
LINE 44: feared, at first, he was going to torture me by unsatisfactory replies,
LINE 45: and either leave me quite in the dark concerning what I wanted to know,
LINE 46: or force me to drag the information out of him, morsel by morsel, by
LINE 47: direct inquiries. "And serve you right," you will say; but he was more
LINE 48: merciful; and in a little while he put his sister's letter into my
LINE 49: hand. I silently read it, and restored it to him without comment or
LINE 50: remark. This mode of procedure suited him so well, that thereafter he
LINE 51: always pursued the plan of showing me her letters at once, when
LINE 52: "inquired" after her, if there were any to show—it was so much less
LINE 53: trouble than to tell me their contents; and I received such confidences
LINE 54: so quietly and discreetly that he was never induced to discontinue
LINE 55: them.
LINE 56: But I devoured those precious letters with my eyes, and never let them
LINE 57: go till their contents were stamped upon my mind; and when I got home,
LINE 58: the most important passages were entered in my diary among the
LINE 59: remarkable events of the day.
LINE 60: The first of these communications brought intelligence of a serious
LINE 61: relapse in Mr. Huntingdon's illness, entirely the result of his own
LINE 62: infatuation in persisting in the indulgence of his appetite for
LINE 63: stimulating drink. In vain had she remonstrated, in vain she had
LINE 64: mingled his wine with water: her arguments and entreaties were a
LINE 65: nuisance, her interference was an insult so intolerable that, at
LINE 66: length, on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was
LINE 67: brought him, he threw the bottle out of the window, swearing he would
LINE 68: not be cheated like a baby, ordered the butler, on pain of instant
LINE 69: dismissal, to bring a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar, and
LINE 70: affirming that he should have been well long ago if he had been let to
LINE 71: have his own way, but she wanted to keep him weak in order that she
LINE 72: might have him under her thumb—but, by the Lord Harry, he would have no
LINE 73: more humbug—seized a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other, and
LINE 74: never rested till he had drunk it dry. Alarming symptoms were the
LINE 75: immediate result of this "imprudence," as she mildly termed it—symptoms
LINE 76: which had rather increased than diminished since; and this was the
LINE 77: cause of her delay in writing to her brother. Every former feature of
LINE 78: his malady had returned with augmented virulence: the slight external
LINE 79: wound, half healed, had broken out afresh; internal inflammation had
LINE 80: taken place, which might terminate fatally if not soon removed. Of
LINE 81: course, the wretched sufferer's temper was not improved by this
LINE 82: calamity—in fact, I suspect it was well nigh insupportable, though his
LINE 83: kind nurse did not complain; but she said she had been obliged at last
LINE 84: to give her son in charge to Esther Hargrave, as her presence was so
LINE 85: constantly required in the sick-room that she could not possibly attend
LINE 86: to him herself; and though the child had begged to be allowed to
LINE 87: continue with her there, and to help her to nurse his papa, and though
LINE 88: she had no doubt he would have been very good and quiet, she could not
LINE 89: think of subjecting his young and tender feelings to the sight of so
LINE 90: much suffering, or of allowing him to witness his father's impatience,
LINE 91: or hear the dreadful language he was wont to use in his paroxysms of
LINE 92: pain or irritation.
LINE 93: The latter (continued she) most deeply regrets the step that has
LINE 94: occasioned his relapse; but, as usual, he throws the blame upon me. If
LINE 95: I had reasoned with him like a rational creature, he says, it never
LINE 96: would have happened; but to be treated like a baby or a fool was enough
LINE 97: to put any man past his patience, and drive him to assert his
LINE 98: independence even at the sacrifice of his own interest. He forgets how
LINE 99: often I had _reasoned_ him "past his patience" before. He appears to be
LINE 100: sensible of his danger; but nothing can induce him to behold it in the
LINE 101: proper light. The other night, while I was waiting on him, and just as
LINE 102: I had brought him a draught to assuage his burning thirst, he observed,
LINE 103: with a return of his former sarcastic bitterness, "Yes, you're mighty
LINE 104: attentive _now!_ I suppose there's _nothing_ you wouldn't do for me
LINE 105: now?"
LINE 106: "You know," said I, a little surprised at his manner, "that I am
LINE 107: willing to do anything I can to relieve you."
LINE 108: "Yes, _now_, my immaculate angel; but when once you have secured your
LINE 109: reward, and find yourself safe in heaven, and me howling in hell-fire,
LINE 110: catch you lifting a finger to serve me _then!_ No, you'll look
LINE 111: complacently on, and not so much as dip the tip of your finger in water
LINE 112: to cool my tongue!"
LINE 113: "If so, it will be because of the great gulf over which I cannot pass;
LINE 114: and if I _could_ look complacently on in such a case, it would be only
LINE 115: from the assurance that you were being purified from your sins, and
LINE 116: fitted to enjoy the happiness I felt.—But are you _determined_, Arthur,
LINE 117: that I shall not meet you in heaven?"
LINE 118: "Humph! What should I do there, I should like to know?"
LINE 119: "Indeed, I cannot tell; and I fear it is too certain that your tastes
LINE 120: and feelings must be widely altered before you can have any enjoyment
LINE 121: there. But do you prefer sinking, without an effort, into the state of
LINE 122: torment you picture to yourself?"
LINE 123: "Oh, it's all a fable," said he, contemptuously.
LINE 124: "Are you sure, Arthur? are you _quite_ sure? Because, if there is any
LINE 125: doubt, and if you _should_ find yourself mistaken after all, when it is
LINE 126: too late to turn—"
LINE 127: "It would be rather awkward, to be sure," said he; "but don't bother me
LINE 128: now—I'm not going to die yet. I can't and won't," he added vehemently,
LINE 129: as if suddenly struck with the appalling aspect of that terrible event.
LINE 130: "Helen, you _must_ save me!" And he earnestly seized my hand, and
LINE 131: looked into my face with such imploring eagerness that my heart bled
LINE 132: for him, and I could not speak for tears.
LINE 133: * * * * *
LINE 134: The next letter brought intelligence that the malady was fast
LINE 135: increasing; and the poor sufferer's horror of death was still more
LINE 136: distressing than his impatience of bodily pain. _All_ his friends had
LINE 137: not forsaken him; for Mr. Hattersley, hearing of his danger, had come
LINE 138: to see him from his distant home in the north. His wife had accompanied
LINE 139: him, as much for the pleasure of seeing her dear friend, from whom she
LINE 140: had been parted so long, as to visit her mother and sister.
LINE 141: Mrs. Huntingdon expressed herself glad to see Milicent once more, and
LINE 142: pleased to behold her so happy and well. She is now at the Grove,
LINE 143: continued the letter, but she often calls to see me. Mr. Hattersley
LINE 144: spends much of his time at Arthur's bed-side. With more good feeling
LINE 145: than I gave him credit for, he evinces considerable sympathy for his
LINE 146: unhappy friend, and is far more willing than able to comfort him.
LINE 147: Sometimes he tries to joke and laugh with him, but that will not do;
LINE 148: sometimes he endeavours to cheer him with talk about old times, and
LINE 149: this at one time may serve to divert the sufferer from his own sad
LINE 150: thoughts; at another, it will only plunge him into deeper melancholy
LINE 151: than before; and then Hattersley is confounded, and knows not what to
LINE 152: say, unless it be a timid suggestion that the clergyman might be sent
LINE 153: for. But Arthur will never consent to that: he knows he has rejected
LINE 154: the clergyman's well-meant admonitions with scoffing levity at other
LINE 155: times, and cannot dream of turning to him for consolation now.
LINE 156: Mr. Hattersley sometimes offers his services instead of mine, but
LINE 157: Arthur will not let me go: that strange whim still increases, as his
LINE 158: strength declines—the fancy to have me always by his side. I hardly
LINE 159: ever leave him, except to go into the next room, where I sometimes
LINE 160: snatch an hour or so of sleep when he is quiet; but even then the door
LINE 161: is left ajar, that he may know me to be within call. I am with him now,
LINE 162: while I write, and I fear my occupation annoys him; though I frequently
LINE 163: break off to attend to him, and though Mr. Hattersley is also by his
LINE 164: side. That gentleman came, as he said, to beg a holiday for me, that I
LINE 165: might have a run in the park, this fine frosty morning, with Milicent
LINE 166: and Esther and little Arthur, whom he had driven over to see me. Our
LINE 167: poor invalid evidently felt it a heartless proposition, and would have
LINE 168: felt it still more heartless in me to accede to it. I therefore said I
LINE 169: would only go and speak to them a minute, and then come back. I did but
LINE 170: exchange a few words with them, just outside the portico, inhaling the
LINE 171: fresh, bracing air as I stood, and then, resisting the earnest and
LINE 172: eloquent entreaties of all three to stay a little longer, and join them
LINE 173: in a walk round the garden, I tore myself away and returned to my
LINE 174: patient. I had not been absent five minutes, but he reproached me
LINE 175: bitterly for my levity and neglect. His friend espoused my cause.
LINE 176: "Nay, nay, Huntingdon," said he, "you're too hard upon her; she must
LINE 177: have food and sleep, and a mouthful of fresh air now and then, or she
LINE 178: can't stand it, I tell you. Look at her, man! she's worn to a shadow
LINE 179: already."
LINE 180: "What are her sufferings to mine?" said the poor invalid. "You don't
LINE 181: grudge me these attentions, do you, Helen?"
LINE 182: "No, Arthur, if I could really serve you by them. I would give my life
LINE 183: to save you, if I might."
LINE 184: "Would you, _indeed?_ No!"
LINE 185: "Most willingly I would."
LINE 186: "Ah! that's because you think yourself more fit to die!"
LINE 187: There was a painful pause. He was evidently plunged in gloomy
LINE 188: reflections; but while I pondered for something to say that might
LINE 189: benefit without alarming him, Hattersley, whose mind had been pursuing
LINE 190: almost the same course, broke silence with, "I say, Huntingdon, I
LINE 191: _would_ send for a parson of some sort: if you didn't like the vicar,
LINE 192: you know, you could have his curate, or somebody else."
LINE 193: "No; none of them can benefit me if _she_ can't," was the answer. And
LINE 194: the tears gushed from his eyes as he earnestly exclaimed, "Oh, Helen,
LINE 195: if I had listened to you, it never would have come to this! and if I
LINE 196: had heard you long ago—oh, God! how different it would have been!"
LINE 197: "Hear me now, then, Arthur," said I, gently pressing his hand.
LINE 198: "It's too late now," said he despondingly. And after that another
LINE 199: paroxysm of pain came on; and then his mind began to wander, and we
LINE 200: feared his death was approaching: but an opiate was administered: his
LINE 201: sufferings began to abate, he gradually became more composed, and at
LINE 202: length sank into a kind of slumber. He has been quieter since; and now
LINE 203: Hattersley has left him, expressing a hope that he shall find him
LINE 204: better when he calls to-morrow.
LINE 205: "Perhaps I _may_ recover," he replied; "who knows? This may have been
LINE 206: the crisis. What do _you_ think, Helen?"
LINE 207: Unwilling to depress him, I gave the most cheering answer I could, but
LINE 208: still recommended him to prepare for the possibility of what I inly
LINE 209: feared was but too certain. But he was determined to hope. Shortly
LINE 210: after he relapsed into a kind of doze, but now he groans again.
LINE 211: There is a change. Suddenly he called me to his side, with such a
LINE 212: strange, excited manner, that I feared he was delirious, but he was
LINE 213: not. "That _was_ the crisis, Helen!" said he, delightedly. "I had an
LINE 214: infernal pain here—it is quite gone now. I never was so easy since the
LINE 215: fall—quite gone, by heaven!" and he clasped and kissed my hand in the
LINE 216: very fulness of his heart; but finding I did not participate in his
LINE 217: joy, he quickly flung it from him, and bitterly cursed my coldness and
LINE 218: insensibility. How could I reply? Kneeling beside him, I took his hand
LINE 219: and fondly pressed it to my lips—for the first time since our
LINE 220: separation—and told him, as well as tears would let me speak, that it
LINE 221: was not _that_ that kept me silent: it was the fear that this sudden
LINE 222: cessation of pain was not so favourable a symptom as he supposed. I
LINE 223: immediately sent for the doctor: we are now anxiously awaiting him. I
LINE 224: will tell you what he says. There is still the same freedom from pain,
LINE 225: the same deadness to all sensation where the suffering was most acute.
LINE 226: My worst fears are realised: mortification has commenced. The doctor
LINE 227: has told him there is no hope. No words can describe his anguish. I can
LINE 228: write no more.
LINE 229: * * * * *
LINE 230: The next was still more distressing in the tenor of its contents. The
LINE 231: sufferer was fast approaching dissolution—dragged almost to the verge
LINE 232: of that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate, from which no agony of
LINE 233: prayers or tears could save him. Nothing could comfort him now;
LINE 234: Hattersley's rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain. The
LINE 235: world was nothing to him: life and all its interests, its petty cares
LINE 236: and transient pleasures, were a cruel mockery. To talk of the past was
LINE 237: to torture him with vain remorse; to refer to the future was to
LINE 238: increase his anguish; and yet to be silent was to leave him a prey to
LINE 239: his own regrets and apprehensions. Often he dwelt with shuddering
LINE 240: minuteness on the fate of his perishing clay—the slow, piecemeal
LINE 241: dissolution already invading his frame: the shroud, the coffin, the
LINE 242: dark, lonely grave, and all the horrors of corruption.
LINE 243: "If I try," said his afflicted wife, "to divert him from these
LINE 244: things—to raise his thoughts to higher themes, it is no better:—'Worse
LINE 245: and worse!' he groans. 'If there be really life beyond the tomb, and
LINE 246: judgment after death, how _can_ I face it?'—I cannot do him any good;
LINE 247: he will neither be enlightened, nor roused, nor comforted by anything I
LINE 248: say; and yet he clings to me with unrelenting pertinacity—with a kind
LINE 249: of childish desperation, as if _I_ could save him from the fate he
LINE 250: dreads. He keeps me night and day beside him. He is holding my left
LINE 251: hand now, while I write; he has held it thus for hours: sometimes
LINE 252: quietly, with his pale face upturned to mine: sometimes clutching my
LINE 253: arm with violence—the big drops starting from his forehead at the
LINE 254: thoughts of what he sees, or thinks he sees, before him. If I withdraw
LINE 255: my hand for a moment it distresses him.
LINE 256: "'Stay with me, Helen,' he says; 'let me hold you so: it seems as if
LINE 257: harm could not reach me while you are here. But death _will_ come—it is
LINE 258: coming now—fast, fast!—and—oh, if I _could_ believe there was nothing
LINE 259: after!'
LINE 260: "'Don't try to believe it, Arthur; there is joy and glory after, if you
LINE 261: will but try to reach it!'
LINE 262: "'What, for _me?_' he said, with something like a laugh. 'Are we not to
LINE 263: be judged according to the deeds done in the body? Where's the use of a
LINE 264: probationary existence, if a man may spend it as he pleases, just
LINE 265: contrary to God's decrees, and then go to heaven with the best—if the
LINE 266: vilest sinner may win the reward of the holiest saint, by merely
LINE 267: saying, 'I repent!'"
LINE 268: "'But if you _sincerely_ repent—'
LINE 269: "'I _can't_ repent; I only fear.'
LINE 270: "'You only regret the past for its consequences to yourself?'
LINE 271: "'Just so—except that I'm sorry to have wronged you, Nell, because
LINE 272: you're so good to me.'
LINE 273: "'Think of the goodness of God, and you cannot but be grieved to have
LINE 274: offended Him.'
LINE 275: "'What _is_ God?—I cannot see Him or hear Him.—God is only an idea.'
LINE 276: "'God is Infinite Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness—and LOVE; but if this
LINE 277: idea is too vast for your human faculties—if your mind loses itself in
LINE 278: its overwhelming infinitude, fix it on Him who condescended to take our
LINE 279: nature upon Him, who was raised to heaven even in His glorified human
LINE 280: body, in whom the fulness of the Godhead shines.'
LINE 281: "But he only shook his head and sighed. Then, in another paroxysm of
LINE 282: shuddering horror, he tightened his grasp on my hand and arm, and,
LINE 283: groaning and lamenting, still clung to me with that wild, desperate
LINE 284: earnestness so harrowing to my soul, because I know I cannot help him.
LINE 285: I did my best to soothe and comfort him.
LINE 286: "'Death is so terrible,' he cried, 'I cannot bear it! _You_ don't know,
LINE 287: Helen—you can't imagine what it is, because you haven't it before you!
LINE 288: and when I'm buried, you'll return to your old ways and be as happy as
LINE 289: ever, and all the world will go on just as busy and merry as if I had
LINE 290: never been; while I—' He burst into tears.
LINE 291: "'You needn't let _that_ distress you,' I said; 'we shall all follow
LINE 292: you soon enough.'
LINE 293: "'I wish to God I could take you with me now!' he exclaimed: 'you
LINE 294: should plead for me.'
LINE 295: "'No man can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for him,'
LINE 296: I replied: 'it cost more to redeem their souls—it cost the blood of an
LINE 297: incarnate God, perfect and sinless in Himself, to redeem us from the
LINE 298: bondage of the evil one:—let _Him_ plead for you.'
LINE 299: "But I seem to speak in vain. He does not now, as formerly, laugh these
LINE 300: blessed truths to scorn: but still he cannot trust, or will not
LINE 301: comprehend them. He cannot linger long. He suffers dreadfully, and so
LINE 302: do those that wait upon him. But I will not harass you with further
LINE 303: details: I have said enough, I think, to convince you that I did well
LINE 304: to go to him."
LINE 305: * * * * *
LINE 306: Poor, poor Helen! dreadful indeed her trials must have been! And I
LINE 307: could do nothing to lessen them—nay, it almost seemed as if I had
LINE 308: brought them upon her myself by my own secret desires; and whether I
LINE 309: looked at her husband's sufferings or her own, it seemed almost like a
LINE 310: judgment upon myself for having cherished such a wish.
LINE 311: The next day but one there came another letter. That too was put into
LINE 312: my hands without a remark, and these are its contents:—
LINE 313: Dec. 5th.
LINE 314: He is gone at last. I sat beside him all night, with my hand fast
LINE 315: locked in his, watching the changes of his features and listening to
LINE 316: his failing breath. He had been silent a long time, and I thought he
LINE 317: would never speak again, when he murmured, faintly but
LINE 318: distinctly,—"Pray for me, Helen!"
LINE 319: "I do pray for you, every hour and every minute, Arthur; but you must
LINE 320: pray for yourself."
LINE 321: His lips moved, but emitted no sound;—then his looks became unsettled;
LINE 322: and, from the incoherent, half-uttered words that escaped him from time
LINE 323: to time, supposing him to be now unconscious, I gently disengaged my
LINE 324: hand from his, intending to steal away for a breath of air, for I was
LINE 325: almost ready to faint; but a convulsive movement of the fingers, and a
LINE 326: faintly whispered "Don't leave me!" immediately recalled me: I took his
LINE 327: hand again, and held it till he was no more—and then I fainted. It was
LINE 328: not grief; it was exhaustion, that, till then, I had been enabled
LINE 329: successfully to combat. Oh, Frederick! none can imagine the miseries,
LINE 330: bodily and mental, of that death-bed! How could I endure to think that
LINE 331: that poor trembling soul was hurried away to everlasting torment? it
LINE 332: would drive me mad. But, thank God, I have hope—not only from a vague
LINE 333: dependence on the possibility that penitence and pardon might have
LINE 334: reached him at the last, but from the blessed confidence that, through
LINE 335: whatever purging fires the erring spirit may be doomed to pass—whatever
LINE 336: fate awaits it—still it is not lost, and God, who hateth nothing that
LINE 337: He hath made, _will_ bless it in the end!
LINE 338: His body will be consigned on Thursday to that dark grave he so much
LINE 339: dreaded; but the coffin must be closed as soon as possible. If you will
LINE 340: attend the funeral, come quickly, for I need help.
LINE 341: HELEN HUNTINGDON.
