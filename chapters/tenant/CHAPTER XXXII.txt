LINE 1: October 5th.—Esther Hargrave is getting a fine girl. She is not out of
LINE 2: the school-room yet, but her mother frequently brings her over to call
LINE 3: in the mornings when the gentlemen are out, and sometimes she spends an
LINE 4: hour or two in company with her sister and me, and the children; and
LINE 5: when we go to the Grove, I always contrive to see her, and talk more to
LINE 6: her than to any one else, for I am very much attached to my little
LINE 7: friend, and so is she to me. I wonder what she can see to like in me
LINE 8: though, for I am no longer the happy, lively girl I used to be; but she
LINE 9: has no other society, save that of her uncongenial mother, and her
LINE 10: governess (as artificial and conventional a person as that prudent
LINE 11: mother could procure to rectify the pupil's natural qualities), and,
LINE 12: now and then, her subdued, quiet sister. I often wonder what will be
LINE 13: _her_ lot in life, and so does she; but _her_ speculations on the
LINE 14: future are full of buoyant hope; so were mine once. I shudder to think
LINE 15: of her being awakened, like me, to a sense of their delusive vanity. It
LINE 16: seems as if I should feel her disappointment, even more deeply than my
LINE 17: own. I feel almost as if I were born for such a fate, but _she_ is so
LINE 18: joyous and fresh, so light of heart and free of spirit, and so
LINE 19: guileless and unsuspecting too. Oh, it would be cruel to make her feel
LINE 20: as I feel now, and know what I have known!
LINE 21: Her sister trembles for her too. Yesterday morning, one of October's
LINE 22: brightest, loveliest days, Milicent and I were in the garden enjoying a
LINE 23: brief half-hour together with our children, while Annabella was lying
LINE 24: on the drawing-room sofa, deep in the last new novel. We had been
LINE 25: romping with the little creatures, almost as merry and wild as
LINE 26: themselves, and now paused in the shade of the tall copper beech, to
LINE 27: recover breath and rectify our hair, disordered by the rough play and
LINE 28: the frolicsome breeze, while they toddled together along the broad,
LINE 29: sunny walk; my Arthur supporting the feebler steps of her little Helen,
LINE 30: and sagaciously pointing out to her the brightest beauties of the
LINE 31: border as they passed, with semi-articulate prattle, that did as well
LINE 32: for her as any other mode of discourse. From laughing at the pretty
LINE 33: sight, we began to talk of the children's future life; and that made us
LINE 34: thoughtful. We both relapsed into silent musing as we slowly proceeded
LINE 35: up the walk; and I suppose Milicent, by a train of associations, was
LINE 36: led to think of her sister.
LINE 37: "Helen," said she, "you often see Esther, don't you?"
LINE 38: "Not very often."
LINE 39: "But you have more frequent opportunities of meeting her than I have;
LINE 40: and she loves you, I know, and reverences you too: there is nobody's
LINE 41: opinion she thinks so much of; and she says you have more sense than
LINE 42: mamma."
LINE 43: "That is because she is self-willed, and my opinions more generally
LINE 44: coincide with her own than your mamma's. But what then, Milicent?"
LINE 45: "Well, since you have so much influence with her, I wish you would
LINE 46: seriously impress it upon her, never, on any account, or for anybody's
LINE 47: persuasion, to marry for the sake of money, or rank, or establishment,
LINE 48: or any earthly thing, but true affection and well-grounded esteem."
LINE 49: "There is no necessity for that," said I, "for we have had some
LINE 50: discourse on that subject already, and I assure you her ideas of love
LINE 51: and matrimony are as romantic as any one could desire."
LINE 52: "But romantic notions will not do: I want her to have true notions."
LINE 53: "Very right: but in my judgment, what the world stigmatises as
LINE 54: romantic, is often more nearly allied to the truth than is commonly
LINE 55: supposed; for, if the generous ideas of youth are too often
LINE 56: over-clouded by the sordid views of after-life, that scarcely proves
LINE 57: them to be false."
LINE 58: "Well, but if you think her ideas are what they ought to be, strengthen
LINE 59: them, will you? and confirm them, as far as you can; for _I_ had
LINE 60: romantic notions once, and—I don't mean to say that I regret my lot,
LINE 61: for I am quite sure I don't, but—"
LINE 62: "I understand you," said I; "you are contented for yourself, but you
LINE 63: would not have your sister to suffer the same as you."
LINE 64: "No—or worse. She might have far worse to suffer than I, for _I am_
LINE 65: really contented, Helen, though you mayn't think it: I speak the solemn
LINE 66: truth in saying that I would not exchange my husband for any man on
LINE 67: earth, if I might do it by the plucking of this leaf."
LINE 68: "Well, I believe you: now that you have him, you would not exchange him
LINE 69: for another; but then you would gladly exchange some of his qualities
LINE 70: for those of better men."
LINE 71: "Yes: just as I would gladly exchange some of my own qualities for
LINE 72: those of better women; for neither he nor I are perfect, and I desire
LINE 73: his improvement as earnestly as my own. And he will improve, don't you
LINE 74: think so, Helen? he's only six-and-twenty yet."
LINE 75: "He may," I answered,
LINE 76: "He will, he WILL!" repeated she.
LINE 77: "Excuse the faintness of my acquiescence, Milicent, I would not
LINE 78: discourage your hopes for the world, but mine have been so often
LINE 79: disappointed, that I am become as cold and doubtful in my expectations
LINE 80: as the flattest of octogenarians."
LINE 81: "And yet you do hope, still, even for Mr. Huntingdon?"
LINE 82: "I do, I confess, 'even' for _him;_ for it seems as if life and hope
LINE 83: must cease together. And is he so _much_ worse, Milicent, than Mr.
LINE 84: Hattersley?"
LINE 85: "Well, to give you my candid opinion, I think there is no comparison
LINE 86: between them. But you mustn't be offended, Helen, for you know I always
LINE 87: speak my mind, and you may speak yours too. I sha'n't care."
LINE 88: "I am not offended, love; and my opinion is, that if there _be_ a
LINE 89: comparison made between the two, the difference, for the most part, is
LINE 90: certainly in Hattersley's favour."
LINE 91: Milicent's own heart told her how much it cost me to make this
LINE 92: acknowledgment; and, with a childlike impulse, she expressed her
LINE 93: sympathy by suddenly kissing my cheek, without a word of reply, and
LINE 94: then turning quickly away, caught up her baby, and hid her face in its
LINE 95: frock. How odd it is that we so often weep for each other's distresses,
LINE 96: when we shed not a tear for our own! Her heart had been full enough of
LINE 97: her own sorrows, but it overflowed at the idea of mine; and I, too,
LINE 98: shed tears at the sight of her sympathetic emotion, though I had not
LINE 99: wept for myself for many a week.
LINE 100: [Illustration]
LINE 101: It was one rainy day last week; most of the company were killing time
LINE 102: in the billiard-room, but Milicent and I were with little Arthur and
LINE 103: Helen in the library, and between our books, our children, and each
LINE 104: other, we expected to make out a very agreeable morning. We had not
LINE 105: been thus secluded above two hours, however, when Mr. Hattersley came
LINE 106: in, attracted, I suppose, by the voice of his child, as he was crossing
LINE 107: the hall, for he is prodigiously fond of her, and she of him.
LINE 108: He was redolent of the stables, where he had been regaling himself with
LINE 109: the company of his fellow-creatures the horses ever since breakfast.
LINE 110: But that was no matter to my little namesake; as soon as the colossal
LINE 111: person of her father darkened the door, she uttered a shrill scream of
LINE 112: delight, and, quitting her mother's side, ran crowing towards him,
LINE 113: balancing her course with outstretched arms, and embracing his knee,
LINE 114: threw back her head and laughed in his face. He might well look
LINE 115: smilingly down upon those small, fair features, radiant with innocent
LINE 116: mirth, those clear blue shining eyes, and that soft flaxen hair cast
LINE 117: back upon the little ivory neck and shoulders. Did he not think how
LINE 118: unworthy he was of such a possession? I fear no such idea crossed his
LINE 119: mind. He caught her up, and there followed some minutes of very rough
LINE 120: play, during which it is difficult to say whether the father or the
LINE 121: daughter laughed and shouted the loudest. At length, however, the
LINE 122: boisterous pastime terminated, suddenly, as might be expected: the
LINE 123: little one was hurt, and began to cry; and the ungentle play-fellow
LINE 124: tossed it into its mother's lap, bidding her "make all straight." As
LINE 125: happy to return to that gentle comforter as it had been to leave her,
LINE 126: the child nestled in her arms, and hushed its cries in a moment; and
LINE 127: sinking its little weary head on her bosom, soon dropped asleep.
LINE 128: Meantime Mr. Hattersley strode up to the fire, and interposing his
LINE 129: height and breadth between us and it, stood with arms akimbo, expanding
LINE 130: his chest, and gazing round him as if the house and all its
LINE 131: appurtenances and contents were his own undisputed possessions.
LINE 132: "Deuced bad weather this!" he began. "There'll be no shooting to-day, I
LINE 133: guess." Then, suddenly lifting up his voice, he regaled us with a few
LINE 134: bars of a rollicking song, which abruptly ceasing, he finished the tune
LINE 135: with a whistle, and then continued:—"I say, Mrs. Huntingdon, what a
LINE 136: fine stud your husband has! not large, but good. I've been looking at
LINE 137: them a bit this morning; and upon my word, Black Boss, and Grey Tom,
LINE 138: and that young Nimrod are the finest animals I've seen for many a day!"
LINE 139: Then followed a particular discussion of their various merits,
LINE 140: succeeded by a sketch of the great things _he_ intended to do in the
LINE 141: horse-jockey line, when his old governor thought proper to quit the
LINE 142: stage. "Not that I wish him to close his accounts," added he: "the old
LINE 143: Trojan is welcome to keep his books open as long as he pleases for me."
LINE 144: "I hope so, _indeed_, Mr. Hattersley."
LINE 145: "Oh, yes! It's only my way of talking. The event must come some time,
LINE 146: and so I look to the bright side of it: that's the right plan—isn't it,
LINE 147: Mrs. H.? What are you two doing here? By-the-by, where's Lady
LINE 148: Lowborough?"
LINE 149: "In the billiard-room."
LINE 150: "What a splendid creature she _is!_" continued he, fixing his eyes on
LINE 151: his wife, who changed colour, and looked more and more disconcerted as
LINE 152: he proceeded. "What a noble figure she has; and what magnificent black
LINE 153: eyes; and what a fine spirit of her own; and what a tongue of her own,
LINE 154: too, when she likes to use it. I perfectly adore her! But never mind,
LINE 155: Milicent: I wouldn't have her for my wife, not if she'd a kingdom for
LINE 156: her dowry! I'm better satisfied with the one I have. Now _then!_ what
LINE 157: do you look so sulky for? don't you believe me?"
LINE 158: "Yes, I believe you," murmured she, in a tone of half sad, half sullen
LINE 159: resignation, as she turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping
LINE 160: infant, that she had laid on the sofa beside her.
LINE 161: "Well, _then_, what makes you so cross? Come here, Milly, and tell me
LINE 162: why you can't be satisfied with my assurance."
LINE 163: She went, and putting her little hand within his arm, looked up in his
LINE 164: face, and said softly,—
LINE 165: "What does it amount to, Ralph? Only to this, that though you admire
LINE 166: Annabella so much, and for qualities that I don't possess, you would
LINE 167: still rather have me than her for your wife, which merely proves that
LINE 168: you don't think it necessary to love your wife; you are satisfied if
LINE 169: she can keep your house, and take care of your child. But I'm not
LINE 170: cross; I'm only sorry; for," added she, in a low, tremulous accent,
LINE 171: withdrawing her hand from his arm, and bending her looks on the rug,
LINE 172: "if you don't love me, you don't, and it can't be helped."
LINE 173: "Very true; but who told you I didn't? Did I say I loved Annabella?"
LINE 174: "You said you adored her."
LINE 175: "True, but adoration isn't love. I adore Annabella, but I don't love
LINE 176: her; and I love thee, Milicent, but I don't adore thee." In proof of
LINE 177: his affection, he clutched a handful of her light brown ringlets, and
LINE 178: appeared to twist them unmercifully.
LINE 179: "Do you really, Ralph?" murmured she, with a faint smile beaming
LINE 180: through her tears, just putting up her hand to his, in token that he
LINE 181: pulled _rather_ too hard.
LINE 182: "To be sure I do," responded he: "only you bother me rather,
LINE 183: sometimes."
LINE 184: "_I_ bother you!" cried she, in very natural surprise.
LINE 185: "Yes, _you_—but only by your exceeding goodness. When a boy has been
LINE 186: eating raisins and sugar-plums all day, he longs for a squeeze of sour
LINE 187: orange by way of a change. And did you never, Milly, observe the sands
LINE 188: on the sea-shore; how nice and smooth they look, and how soft and easy
LINE 189: they feel to the foot? But if you plod along, for half an hour, over
LINE 190: this soft, easy carpet—giving way at every step, yielding the more the
LINE 191: harder you press,—you'll find it rather wearisome work, and be glad
LINE 192: enough to come to a bit of good, firm rock, that won't budge an inch
LINE 193: whether you stand, walk, or stamp upon it; and, though it be hard as
LINE 194: the nether millstone, you'll find it the easier footing after all."
LINE 195: "I know what you mean, Ralph," said she, nervously playing with her
LINE 196: watchguard and tracing the figure on the rug with the point of her tiny
LINE 197: foot—"I know what you mean: but I thought you always liked to be
LINE 198: yielded to, and I can't alter now."
LINE 199: "I do like it," replied he, bringing her to him by another tug at her
LINE 200: hair. "You mustn't mind my talk, Milly. A man must have something to
LINE 201: grumble about; and if he can't complain that his wife harries him to
LINE 202: death with her perversity and ill-humour, he must complain that she
LINE 203: wears him out with her kindness and gentleness."
LINE 204: "But why complain at all, unless because you are tired and
LINE 205: dissatisfied?"
LINE 206: "To excuse my own failings, to be sure. Do you think I'll bear all the
LINE 207: burden of my sins on my own shoulders, as long as there's another ready
LINE 208: to help me, with none of her own to carry?"
LINE 209: "There is no such one on earth," said she seriously; and then, taking
LINE 210: his hand from her head, she kissed it with an air of genuine devotion,
LINE 211: and tripped away to the door.
LINE 212: "What now?" said he. "Where are you going?"
LINE 213: "To tidy my hair," she answered, smiling through her disordered locks;
LINE 214: "you've made it all come down."
LINE 215: "Off with you then!—An excellent little woman," he remarked when she
LINE 216: was gone, "but a thought too soft—she almost melts in one's hands. I
LINE 217: positively think I ill-use her sometimes, when I've taken too much—but
LINE 218: I can't help it, for she never complains, either at the time or after.
LINE 219: I suppose she doesn't mind it."
LINE 220: "I can enlighten you on that subject, Mr. Hattersley," said I: "she
LINE 221: _does_ mind it; and some other things she minds still more, which yet
LINE 222: you may never hear her complain of."
LINE 223: "How do you know?—does she complain to you?" demanded he, with a sudden
LINE 224: spark of fury ready to burst into a flame if I should answer 'yes.'
LINE 225: "No," I replied; "but I have known her longer and studied her more
LINE 226: closely than you have done.—And I can tell you, Mr. Hattersley, that
LINE 227: Milicent loves you more than you deserve, and that you have it in your
LINE 228: power to make her very happy, instead of which you are her evil genius,
LINE 229: and, I will venture to say, there is not a single day passes in which
LINE 230: you do not inflict upon her some pang that you might spare her if you
LINE 231: would."
LINE 232: "Well—it's not _my_ fault," said he, gazing carelessly up at the
LINE 233: ceiling and plunging his hands into his pockets: "if my ongoings don't
LINE 234: suit her, she should tell me so."
LINE 235: "Is she not exactly the wife you wanted? Did you not tell Mr.
LINE 236: Huntingdon you must have one that would submit to anything without a
LINE 237: murmur, and never blame you, whatever you did?"
LINE 238: "True, but we shouldn't always have what we want: it spoils the best of
LINE 239: us, doesn't it? How can I help playing the deuce when I see it's all
LINE 240: one to her whether I behave like a Christian or like a scoundrel, such
LINE 241: as nature made me? and how can I help teasing her when she's so
LINE 242: invitingly meek and mim, when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet
LINE 243: and never so much as squeaks to tell me that's enough?"
LINE 244: "If you are a tyrant by nature, the temptation is strong, I allow; but
LINE 245: no generous mind delights to oppress the weak, but rather to cherish
LINE 246: and protect."
LINE 247: "I _don't_ oppress her; but it's so confounded flat to be always
LINE 248: cherishing and protecting; and then, how can I tell that I _am_
LINE 249: oppressing her when she 'melts away and makes no sign'? I sometimes
LINE 250: think she has no feeling at all; and then I go on till she cries, and
LINE 251: that satisfies me."
LINE 252: "Then you _do_ delight to oppress her?"
LINE 253: "I don't, I tell you! only when I'm in a bad humour, or a particularly
LINE 254: good one, and want to afflict for the pleasure of comforting; or when
LINE 255: she looks flat and wants shaking up a bit. And sometimes she provokes
LINE 256: me by crying for nothing, and won't tell me what it's for; and then, I
LINE 257: allow, it enrages me past bearing, especially when I'm not my own man."
LINE 258: "As is no doubt generally the case on such occasions," said I. "But in
LINE 259: future, Mr. Hattersley, when you see her looking flat, or crying for
LINE 260: 'nothing' (as you call it), ascribe it all to yourself: be assured it
LINE 261: is something you have done amiss, or your general misconduct, that
LINE 262: distresses her."
LINE 263: "I don't believe it. If it were, she should tell me so: I don't like
LINE 264: that way of moping and fretting in silence, and saying nothing: it's
LINE 265: not honest. How can she expect me to mend my ways at that rate?"
LINE 266: "Perhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess,
LINE 267: and deludes herself with the hope that you will one day see your own
LINE 268: errors and repair them, if left to your own reflection."
LINE 269: "None of your sneers, Mrs. Huntingdon. I _have_ the sense to see that
LINE 270: I'm not always quite correct, but sometimes I think that's no great
LINE 271: matter, as long as I injure nobody but myself—"
LINE 272: "It _is_ a great matter," interrupted I, "both to yourself (as you will
LINE 273: hereafter find to your cost) and to all connected with you, most
LINE 274: especially your wife. But, indeed, it is nonsense to talk about
LINE 275: injuring no one but yourself: it is impossible to injure yourself,
LINE 276: especially by such acts as we allude to, without injuring hundreds, if
LINE 277: not thousands, besides, in a greater or less, degree, either by the
LINE 278: evil you do or the good you leave undone."
LINE 279: "And as I was saying," continued he, "or would have said if you hadn't
LINE 280: taken me up so short, I sometimes think I should do better if I were
LINE 281: joined to one that would always remind me when I was wrong, and give me
LINE 282: a motive for doing good and eschewing evil, by decidedly showing her
LINE 283: approval of the one and disapproval of the other."
LINE 284: "If you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellow-mortal,
LINE 285: it would do you little good."
LINE 286: "Well, but if I had a mate that would not always be yielding, and
LINE 287: always equally kind, but that would have the spirit to stand at bay now
LINE 288: and then, and honestly tell me her mind at all times, such a one as
LINE 289: yourself for instance. Now, if I went on with you as I do with her when
LINE 290: I'm in London, you'd make the house too hot to hold me at times, I'll
LINE 291: be sworn."
LINE 292: "You mistake me: I'm no termagant."
LINE 293: "Well, all the better for that, for I can't stand contradiction, in a
LINE 294: general way, and I'm as fond of my own will as another; only I think
LINE 295: too much of it doesn't answer for any man."
LINE 296: "Well, I would never contradict you without a cause, but certainly I
LINE 297: would always let you know what I thought of your conduct; and if you
LINE 298: oppressed me, in body, mind, or estate, you should at least have no
LINE 299: reason to suppose 'I didn't mind it.'"
LINE 300: "I know that, my lady; and I think if my little wife were to follow the
LINE 301: same plan, it would be better for us both."
LINE 302: "I'll tell her."
LINE 303: "No, no, let her be; there's much to be said on both sides, and, now I
LINE 304: think upon it, Huntingdon often regrets that you are not more like her,
LINE 305: scoundrelly dog that he is, and you see, after all, you can't reform
LINE 306: _him:_ he's _ten_ times worse than I. He's afraid of you, to be sure;
LINE 307: that is, he's always on his best behaviour in your presence—but—"
LINE 308: "I wonder what his worst behaviour is like, then?" I could not forbear
LINE 309: observing.
LINE 310: "Why, to tell you the truth, it's very bad indeed—isn't it, Hargrave?"
LINE 311: said he, addressing that gentleman, who had entered the room
LINE 312: unperceived by me, for I was now standing near the fire, with my back
LINE 313: to the door. "Isn't Huntingdon," he continued, "as great a reprobate as
LINE 314: ever was d—d?"
LINE 315: "His lady will not hear him censured with impunity," replied Mr.
LINE 316: Hargrave, coming forward; "but I must say, I thank God I am not such
LINE 317: another."
LINE 318: "Perhaps it would become you better," said I, "to look at what you are,
LINE 319: and say, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.'"
LINE 320: "You are severe," returned he, bowing slightly and drawing himself up
LINE 321: with a proud yet injured air. Hattersley laughed, and clapped him on
LINE 322: the shoulder. Moving from under his hand with a gesture of insulted
LINE 323: dignity, Mr. Hargrave took himself away to the other end of the rug.
LINE 324: "Isn't it a shame, Mrs. Huntingdon?" cried his brother-in-law; "I
LINE 325: struck Walter Hargrave when I was drunk, the second night after we
LINE 326: came, and he's turned a cold shoulder on me ever since; though I asked
LINE 327: his pardon the very morning after it was done!"
LINE 328: "Your manner of asking it," returned the other, "and the clearness with
LINE 329: which you remembered the whole transaction, showed you were not too
LINE 330: drunk to be fully conscious of what you were about, and quite
LINE 331: responsible for the deed."
LINE 332: "You wanted to interfere between me and my wife," grumbled Hattersley,
LINE 333: "and that is enough to provoke any man."
LINE 334: "You justify it, then?" said his opponent, darting upon him a most
LINE 335: vindictive glance.
LINE 336: "No, I tell you I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been under
LINE 337: excitement; and if you choose to bear malice for it after all the
LINE 338: handsome things I've said, do so and be d—d!"
LINE 339: "I _would_ refrain from such language in a _lady's_ presence, at
LINE 340: least," said Mr. Hargrave, hiding his anger under a mask of disgust.
LINE 341: "What have I said?" returned Hattersley: "nothing but heaven's truth.
LINE 342: He will be damned, won't he, Mrs. Huntingdon, if he doesn't forgive his
LINE 343: brother's trespasses?"
LINE 344: "You ought to forgive him, Mr. Hargrave, since he asks you," said I.
LINE 345: "Do you say so? Then I will!" And, smiling almost frankly, he stepped
LINE 346: forward and offered his hand. It was immediately clasped in that of his
LINE 347: relative, and the reconciliation was apparently cordial on both sides.
LINE 348: "The affront," continued Hargrave, turning to me, "owed half its
LINE 349: bitterness to the fact of its being offered in your presence; and since
LINE 350: you bid me forgive it, I will, and forget it too."
LINE 351: "I guess the best return I can make will be to take myself off,"
LINE 352: muttered Hattersley, with a broad grin. His companion smiled, and he
LINE 353: left the room. This put me on my guard. Mr. Hargrave turned seriously
LINE 354: to me, and earnestly began,—
LINE 355: "Dear Mrs. Huntingdon, how I have longed for, yet dreaded, this hour!
LINE 356: Do not be alarmed," he added, for my face was crimson with anger: "I am
LINE 357: not about to offend you with any useless entreaties or complaints. I am
LINE 358: not going to presume to trouble you with the mention of my own feelings
LINE 359: or your perfections, but I have something to reveal to you which you
LINE 360: ought to know, and which, yet, it pains me inexpressibly—"
LINE 361: "Then don't trouble yourself to reveal it!"
LINE 362: "But it is of importance—"
LINE 363: "If so I shall hear it soon enough, especially if it is bad news, as
LINE 364: you seem to consider it. At present I am going to take the children to
LINE 365: the nursery."
LINE 366: "But can't you ring and send them?"
LINE 367: "No; I want the exercise of a run to the top of the house. Come,
LINE 368: Arthur."
LINE 369: "But you will return?"
LINE 370: "Not yet; don't wait."
LINE 371: "Then when may I see you again?"
LINE 372: "At lunch," said I, departing with little Helen in one arm and leading
LINE 373: Arthur by the hand.
LINE 374: He turned away, muttering some sentence of impatient censure or
LINE 375: complaint, in which "heartless" was the only distinguishable word.
LINE 376: "What nonsense is this, Mr. Hargrave?" said I, pausing in the doorway.
LINE 377: "What do you mean?"
LINE 378: "Oh, nothing; I did not intend you should hear my soliloquy. But the
LINE 379: fact is, Mrs. Huntingdon, I have a disclosure to make, painful for me
LINE 380: to offer as for you to hear; and I want you to give me a few minutes of
LINE 381: your attention in private at any time and place you like to appoint. It
LINE 382: is from no selfish motive that I ask it, and not for any cause that
LINE 383: could alarm your superhuman purity: therefore you need not kill me with
LINE 384: that look of cold and pitiless disdain. I know too well the feelings
LINE 385: with which the bearers of bad tidings are commonly regarded not to—"
LINE 386: "What _is_ this wonderful piece of intelligence?" said I, impatiently
LINE 387: interrupting him. "If it is anything of real importance, speak it in
LINE 388: three words before I go."
LINE 389: "In three words I cannot. Send those children away and stay with me."
LINE 390: "No; keep your bad tidings to yourself. I know it is something I don't
LINE 391: want to hear, and something you would displease me by telling."
LINE 392: "You have divined too truly, I fear; but still, since I know it, I feel
LINE 393: it my duty to disclose it to you."
LINE 394: "Oh, spare us both the infliction, and I will exonerate you from the
LINE 395: duty. You have offered to tell; I have refused to hear: my ignorance
LINE 396: will not be charged on you."
LINE 397: "Be it so: you shall not hear it from me. But if the blow fall too
LINE 398: suddenly upon you when it comes, remember I wished to soften it!"
LINE 399: I left him. I was determined his words should not alarm me. What could
LINE 400: _he_, of all men, have to reveal that was of importance for _me_ to
LINE 401: hear? It was no doubt some exaggerated tale about my unfortunate
LINE 402: husband that he wished to make the most of to serve his own bad
LINE 403: purposes.
LINE 404: 6th.—He has not alluded to this momentous mystery since, and I have
LINE 405: seen no reason to repent of my unwillingness to hear it. The threatened
LINE 406: blow has not been struck yet, and I do not greatly fear it. At present
LINE 407: I am pleased with Arthur: he has not positively disgraced himself for
LINE 408: upwards of a fortnight, and all this last week has been so very
LINE 409: moderate in his indulgence at table that I can perceive a marked
LINE 410: difference in his general temper and appearance. Dare I hope this will
LINE 411: continue?
