LINE 1: Next morning, I bethought me, I, too, had business at L——; so I mounted
LINE 2: my horse, and set forth on the expedition soon after breakfast. It was
LINE 3: a dull, drizzly day; but that was no matter: it was all the more
LINE 4: suitable to my frame of mind. It was likely to be a lonely journey; for
LINE 5: it was no market-day, and the road I traversed was little frequented at
LINE 6: any other time; but that suited me all the better too.
LINE 7: As I trotted along, however, chewing the cud of—_bitter_ fancies, I
LINE 8: heard another horse at no great distance behind me; but I never
LINE 9: conjectured who the rider might be, or troubled my head about him,
LINE 10: till, on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle acclivity, or rather,
LINE 11: suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk—for, rapt in my
LINE 12: own reflections, I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought
LINE 13: proper—I lost ground, and my fellow-traveller overtook me. He accosted
LINE 14: me by name, for it was no stranger—it was Mr. Lawrence! Instinctively
LINE 15: the fingers of my whip-hand tingled, and grasped their charge with
LINE 16: convulsive energy; but I restrained the impulse, and answering his
LINE 17: salutation with a nod, attempted to push on; but he pushed on beside
LINE 18: me, and began to talk about the weather and the crops. I gave the
LINE 19: briefest possible answers to his queries and observations, and fell
LINE 20: back. He fell back too, and asked if my horse was lame. I replied with
LINE 21: a _look_, at which he placidly smiled.
LINE 22: I was as much astonished as exasperated at this singular pertinacity
LINE 23: and imperturbable assurance on his part. I had thought the
LINE 24: circumstances of our last meeting would have left such an impression on
LINE 25: his mind as to render him cold and distant ever after: instead of that,
LINE 26: he appeared not only to have forgotten all former offences, but to be
LINE 27: impenetrable to all present incivilities. Formerly, the slightest hint,
LINE 28: or mere fancied coldness in tone or glance, had sufficed to repulse
LINE 29: him: now, positive rudeness could not drive him away. Had he heard of
LINE 30: my disappointment; and was he come to witness the result, and triumph
LINE 31: in my despair? I grasped my whip with more determined energy than
LINE 32: before—but still forbore to raise it, and rode on in silence, waiting
LINE 33: for some more tangible cause of offence, before I opened the floodgates
LINE 34: of my soul and poured out the dammed-up fury that was foaming and
LINE 35: swelling within.
LINE 36: "Markham," said he, in his usual quiet tone, "why do you quarrel with
LINE 37: your friends, because you have been disappointed in one quarter? You
LINE 38: have found your hopes defeated; but how am _I_ to blame for it? I
LINE 39: warned you beforehand, you know, but you would not—"
LINE 40: He said no more; for, impelled by some fiend at my elbow, I had seized
LINE 41: my whip by the small end, and—swift and sudden as a flash of
LINE 42: lightning—brought the other down upon his head. It was not without a
LINE 43: feeling of savage satisfaction that I beheld the instant, deadly pallor
LINE 44: that overspread his face, and the few red drops that trickled down his
LINE 45: forehead, while he reeled a moment in his saddle, and then fell
LINE 46: backward to the ground. The pony, surprised to be so strangely relieved
LINE 47: of its burden, started and capered, and kicked a little, and then made
LINE 48: use of its freedom to go and crop the grass of the hedge-bank: while
LINE 49: its master lay as still and silent as a corpse. Had I killed him?—an
LINE 50: icy hand seemed to grasp my heart and check its pulsation, as I bent
LINE 51: over him, gazing with breathless intensity upon the ghastly, upturned
LINE 52: face. But no; he moved his eyelids and uttered a slight groan. I
LINE 53: breathed again—he was only stunned by the fall. It served him right—it
LINE 54: would teach him better manners in future. Should I help him to his
LINE 55: horse? No. For any other combination of offences I would; but his were
LINE 56: too unpardonable. He might mount it himself, if he liked—in a while:
LINE 57: already he was beginning to stir and look about him—and there it was
LINE 58: for him, quietly browsing on the road-side.
LINE 59: So with a muttered execration I left the fellow to his fate, and
LINE 60: clapping spurs to my own horse, galloped away, excited by a combination
LINE 61: of feelings it would not be easy to analyse; and perhaps, if I did so,
LINE 62: the result would not be very creditable to my disposition; for I am not
LINE 63: sure that a species of exultation in what I had done was not one
LINE 64: principal concomitant.
LINE 65: Shortly, however, the effervescence began to abate, and not many
LINE 66: minutes elapsed before I had turned and gone back to look after the
LINE 67: fate of my victim. It was no generous impulse—no kind relentings that
LINE 68: led me to this—nor even the fear of what might be the consequences to
LINE 69: myself, if I finished my assault upon the squire by leaving him thus
LINE 70: neglected, and exposed to further injury; it was, simply, the voice of
LINE 71: conscience; and I took great credit to myself for attending so promptly
LINE 72: to its dictates—and judging the merit of the deed by the sacrifice it
LINE 73: cost, I was not far wrong.
LINE 74: Mr. Lawrence and his pony had both altered their positions in some
LINE 75: degree. The pony had wandered eight or ten yards further away; and he
LINE 76: had managed, somehow, to remove himself from the middle of the road: I
LINE 77: found him seated in a recumbent position on the bank,—looking very
LINE 78: white and sickly still, and holding his cambric handkerchief (now more
LINE 79: red than white) to his head. It must have been a powerful blow; but
LINE 80: half the credit—or the blame of it (which you please) must be
LINE 81: attributed to the whip, which was garnished with a massive horse's head
LINE 82: of plated metal. The grass, being sodden with rain, afforded the young
LINE 83: gentleman a rather inhospitable couch; his clothes were considerably
LINE 84: bemired; and his hat was rolling in the mud on the other side of the
LINE 85: road. But his thoughts seemed chiefly bent upon his pony, on which he
LINE 86: was wistfully gazing—half in helpless anxiety, and half in hopeless
LINE 87: abandonment to his fate.
LINE 88: I dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the nearest
LINE 89: tree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his head; but
LINE 90: either he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, in its
LINE 91: present condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the one, he
LINE 92: took the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it aside.
LINE 93: "It's good enough for _you_," I muttered.
LINE 94: My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which
LINE 95: was soon accomplished; for the beast was quiet enough in the main, and
LINE 96: only winced and flirted a trifle till I got hold of the bridle—but
LINE 97: then, I must see him in the saddle.
LINE 98: "Here, you fellow—scoundrel—dog—give me your hand, and I'll help you to
LINE 99: mount."
LINE 100: No; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him by the arm.
LINE 101: He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch.
LINE 102: "What, you won't! Well! you may sit there till doomsday, for what I
LINE 103: care. But I suppose you don't want to lose all the blood in your
LINE 104: body—I'll just condescend to bind that up for you."
LINE 105: "Let me alone, if you please."
LINE 106: "Humph; with all my heart. You may go to the d—l, if you choose—and say
LINE 107: I sent you."
LINE 108: But before I abandoned him to his fate I flung his pony's bridle over a
LINE 109: stake in the hedge, and threw him my handkerchief, as his own was now
LINE 110: saturated with blood. He took it and cast it back to me in abhorrence
LINE 111: and contempt, with all the strength he could muster. It wanted but this
LINE 112: to fill the measure of his offences. With execrations not loud but deep
LINE 113: I left him to live or die as he could, well satisfied that I had done
LINE 114: _my_ duty in attempting to save him—but forgetting how I had erred in
LINE 115: bringing him into such a condition, and how insultingly my
LINE 116: after-services had been offered—and sullenly prepared to meet the
LINE 117: consequences if he should choose to say I had attempted to murder
LINE 118: him—which I thought not unlikely, as it seemed probable he was actuated
LINE 119: by such spiteful motives in so perseveringly refusing my assistance.
LINE 120: Having remounted my horse, I just looked back to see how he was getting
LINE 121: on, before I rode away. He had risen from the ground, and grasping his
LINE 122: pony's mane, was attempting to resume his seat in the saddle; but
LINE 123: scarcely had he put his foot in the stirrup, when a sickness or
LINE 124: dizziness seemed to overpower him: he leant forward a moment, with his
LINE 125: head drooped on the animal's back, and then made one more effort, which
LINE 126: proving ineffectual, he sank back on the bank, where I left him,
LINE 127: reposing his head on the oozy turf, and to all appearance, as calmly
LINE 128: reclining as if he had been taking his rest on his sofa at home.
LINE 129: I ought to have helped him in spite of himself—to have bound up the
LINE 130: wound he was unable to staunch, and insisted upon getting him on his
LINE 131: horse and seeing him safe home; but, besides my bitter indignation
LINE 132: against himself, there was the question what to say to his servants—and
LINE 133: what to my own family. Either I should have to acknowledge the deed,
LINE 134: which would set me down as a madman, unless I acknowledged the motive
LINE 135: too—and that seemed impossible—or I must get up a lie, which seemed
LINE 136: equally out of the question—especially as Mr. Lawrence would probably
LINE 137: reveal the whole truth, and thereby bring me to tenfold disgrace—unless
LINE 138: I were villain enough, presuming on the absence of witnesses, to
LINE 139: persist in my own version of the case, and make him out a still greater
LINE 140: scoundrel than he was. No; he had only received a cut above the temple,
LINE 141: and perhaps a few bruises from the fall, or the hoofs of his own pony:
LINE 142: that could not kill him if he lay there half the day; and, if he could
LINE 143: not help himself, surely some one would be coming by: it would be
LINE 144: impossible that a whole day should pass and no one traverse the road
LINE 145: but ourselves. As for what he might choose to say hereafter, I would
LINE 146: take my chance about it: if he told lies, I would contradict him; if he
LINE 147: told the truth, I would bear it as best I could. I was not _obliged_ to
LINE 148: enter into explanations further than I thought proper. Perhaps he might
LINE 149: choose to be silent on the subject, for fear of raising inquiries as to
LINE 150: the cause of the quarrel, and drawing the public attention to his
LINE 151: connection with Mrs. Graham, which, whether for her sake or his own, he
LINE 152: seemed so very desirous to conceal.
LINE 153: Thus reasoning, I trotted away to the town, where I duly transacted my
LINE 154: business, and performed various little commissions for my mother and
LINE 155: Rose, with very laudable exactitude, considering the different
LINE 156: circumstances of the case. In returning home, I was troubled with
LINE 157: sundry misgivings about the unfortunate Lawrence. The question, What if
LINE 158: I should find him lying still on the damp earth, fairly dying of cold
LINE 159: and exhaustion—or already stark and chill? thrust itself most
LINE 160: unpleasantly upon my mind, and the appalling possibility pictured
LINE 161: itself with painful vividness to my imagination as I approached the
LINE 162: spot where I had left him. But no, thank heaven, both man and horse
LINE 163: were gone, and nothing was left to witness against me but two
LINE 164: objects—unpleasant enough in themselves to be sure, and presenting a
LINE 165: very ugly, not to say murderous appearance—in one place, the hat
LINE 166: saturated with rain and coated with mud, indented and broken above the
LINE 167: brim by that villainous whip-handle; in another, the crimson
LINE 168: handkerchief, soaking in a deeply tinctured pool of water—for much rain
LINE 169: had fallen in the interim.
LINE 170: Bad news flies fast: it was hardly four o'clock when I got home, but my
LINE 171: mother gravely accosted me with—"Oh, Gilbert!—_Such_ an accident! Rose
LINE 172: has been shopping in the village, and she's heard that Mr. Lawrence has
LINE 173: been thrown from his horse and brought home dying!"
LINE 174: This shocked me a trifle, as you may suppose; but I was comforted to
LINE 175: hear that he had frightfully fractured his skull and broken a leg; for,
LINE 176: assured of the falsehood of this, I trusted the rest of the story was
LINE 177: equally exaggerated; and when I heard my mother and sister so feelingly
LINE 178: deploring his condition, I had considerable difficulty in preventing
LINE 179: myself from telling them the real extent of the injuries, as far as I
LINE 180: knew them.
LINE 181: "You must go and see him to-morrow," said my mother.
LINE 182: "Or to-day," suggested Rose: "there's plenty of time; and you can have
LINE 183: the pony, as your horse is tired. Won't you, Gilbert—as soon as you've
LINE 184: had something to eat?"
LINE 185: "No, no—how can we tell that it isn't all a false report? It's highly
LINE 186: im-"
LINE 187: "Oh, I'm sure it isn't; for the village is all alive about it; and I
LINE 188: saw two people that had seen others that had seen the man that found
LINE 189: him. That sounds far-fetched; but it isn't so when you think of it."
LINE 190: "Well, but Lawrence is a good rider; it is not likely he would fall
LINE 191: from his horse at all; and if he did, it is highly improbable he would
LINE 192: break his bones in that way. It must be a gross exaggeration at least."
LINE 193: "No; but the horse kicked him—or something."
LINE 194: "What, his quiet little pony?"
LINE 195: "How do you know it was that?"
LINE 196: "He seldom rides any other."
LINE 197: "At any rate," said my mother, "you will call to-morrow. Whether it be
LINE 198: true or false, exaggerated or otherwise, we shall like to know how he
LINE 199: is."
LINE 200: "Fergus may go."
LINE 201: "Why not you?"
LINE 202: "He has more time. I am busy just now."
LINE 203: "Oh! but, Gilbert, how can you be so composed about it? You won't mind
LINE 204: business for an hour or two in a case of this sort, when your friend is
LINE 205: at the point of death."
LINE 206: "He is _not_, I tell you."
LINE 207: "For anything you know, he _may_ be: you can't tell till you have seen
LINE 208: him. At all events, he must have met with some terrible accident, and
LINE 209: you ought to see him: he'll take it very unkind if you don't."
LINE 210: "Confound it! I can't. He and I have not been on good terms of late."
LINE 211: "Oh, my _dear_ boy! Surely, surely you are not so unforgiving as to
LINE 212: carry your little differences to such a length as—"
LINE 213: "Little differences, indeed!" I muttered.
LINE 214: "Well, but only remember the occasion. Think how—"
LINE 215: "Well, well, don't bother me now—I'll see about it," I replied.
LINE 216: And my seeing about it was to send Fergus next morning, with my
LINE 217: mother's compliments, to make the requisite inquiries; for, of course,
LINE 218: my going was out of the question—or sending a message either. He
LINE 219: brought back intelligence that the young squire was laid up with the
LINE 220: complicated evils of a broken head and certain contusions (occasioned
LINE 221: by a fall—of which he did not trouble himself to relate the
LINE 222: particulars—and the subsequent misconduct of his horse), and a severe
LINE 223: cold, the consequence of lying on the wet ground in the rain; but there
LINE 224: were no broken bones, and no immediate prospects of dissolution.
LINE 225: It was evident, then, that for Mrs. Graham's sake it was not his
LINE 226: intention to criminate me.
