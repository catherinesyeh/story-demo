LINE 1: Those were four miserable months, alternating between intense anxiety,
LINE 2: despair, and indignation, pity for him and pity for myself. And yet,
LINE 3: through all, I was not wholly comfortless: I had my darling, sinless,
LINE 4: inoffensive little one to console me; but even this consolation was
LINE 5: embittered by the constantly-recurring thought, "How shall I teach him
LINE 6: hereafter to respect his father, and yet to avoid his example?"
LINE 7: But I remembered that I had brought all these afflictions, in a manner
LINE 8: wilfully, upon myself; and I determined to bear them without a murmur.
LINE 9: At the same time I resolved not to give myself up to misery for the
LINE 10: transgressions of another, and endeavoured to divert myself as much as
LINE 11: I could; and besides the companionship of my child, and my dear,
LINE 12: faithful Rachel, who evidently guessed my sorrows and felt for them,
LINE 13: though she was too discreet to allude to them, I had my books and
LINE 14: pencil, my domestic affairs, and the welfare and comfort of Arthur's
LINE 15: poor tenants and labourers to attend to: and I sometimes sought and
LINE 16: obtained amusement in the company of my young friend Esther Hargrave:
LINE 17: occasionally I rode over to see her, and once or twice I had her to
LINE 18: spend the day with me at the Manor. Mrs. Hargrave did not visit London
LINE 19: that season: having no daughter to marry, she thought it as well to
LINE 20: stay at home and economise; and, for a wonder, Walter came down to join
LINE 21: her in the beginning of June, and stayed till near the close of August.
LINE 22: The first time I saw him was on a sweet, warm evening, when I was
LINE 23: sauntering in the park with little Arthur and Rachel, who is head-nurse
LINE 24: and lady's-maid in one—for, with my secluded life and tolerably active
LINE 25: habits, I require but little attendance, and as she had nursed me and
LINE 26: coveted to nurse my child, and was moreover so very trustworthy, I
LINE 27: preferred committing the important charge to her, with a young
LINE 28: nursery-maid under her directions, to engaging any one else: besides,
LINE 29: it saves money; and since I have made acquaintance with Arthur's
LINE 30: affairs, I have learnt to regard that as no trifling recommendation;
LINE 31: for, by my own desire, nearly the whole of the income of my fortune is
LINE 32: devoted, for years to come, to the paying off of his debts, and the
LINE 33: money he contrives to squander away in London is incomprehensible. But
LINE 34: to return to Mr. Hargrave. I was standing with Rachel beside the water,
LINE 35: amusing the laughing baby in her arms with a twig of willow laden with
LINE 36: golden catkins, when, greatly to my surprise, he entered the park,
LINE 37: mounted on his costly black hunter, and crossed over the grass to meet
LINE 38: me. He saluted me with a very fine compliment, delicately worded, and
LINE 39: modestly delivered withal, which he had doubtless concocted as he rode
LINE 40: along. He told me he had brought a message from his mother, who, as he
LINE 41: was riding that way, had desired him to call at the Manor and beg the
LINE 42: pleasure of my company to a friendly family dinner to-morrow.
LINE 43: "There is no one to meet but ourselves," said he; "but Esther is very
LINE 44: anxious to see you; and my mother fears you will feel solitary in this
LINE 45: great house so much alone, and wishes she could persuade you to give
LINE 46: her the pleasure of your company more frequently, and make yourself at
LINE 47: home in our more humble dwelling, till Mr. Huntingdon's return shall
LINE 48: render this a little more conducive to your comfort."
LINE 49: "She is very kind," I answered, "but I am not alone, you see;—and those
LINE 50: whose time is fully occupied seldom complain of solitude."
LINE 51: "Will you not come to-morrow, then? She will be sadly disappointed if
LINE 52: you refuse."
LINE 53: I did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness; but,
LINE 54: however, I promised to come.
LINE 55: "What a sweet evening this is!" observed he, looking round upon the
LINE 56: sunny park, with its imposing swell and slope, its placid water, and
LINE 57: majestic clumps of trees. "And what a paradise you live in!"
LINE 58: "It is a lovely evening," answered I; and I sighed to think how little
LINE 59: I had felt its loveliness, and how little of a paradise sweet Grassdale
LINE 60: was to me—how still less to the voluntary exile from its scenes.
LINE 61: Whether Mr. Hargrave divined my thoughts, I cannot tell, but, with a
LINE 62: half-hesitating, sympathising seriousness of tone and manner, he asked
LINE 63: if I had lately heard from Mr. Huntingdon.
LINE 64: "Not lately," I replied.
LINE 65: "I thought not," he muttered, as if to himself, looking thoughtfully on
LINE 66: the ground.
LINE 67: "Are you not lately returned from London?" I asked.
LINE 68: "Only yesterday."
LINE 69: "And did you see him there?"
LINE 70: "Yes—I saw him."
LINE 71: "Was he well?"
LINE 72: "Yes—that is," said he, with increasing hesitation and an appearance of
LINE 73: suppressed indignation, "he was as well as—as he deserved to be, but
LINE 74: under circumstances I should have deemed incredible for a man so
LINE 75: favoured as he is." He here looked up and pointed the sentence with a
LINE 76: serious bow to me. I suppose my face was crimson.
LINE 77: "Pardon me, Mrs. Huntingdon," he continued, "but I cannot suppress my
LINE 78: indignation when I behold such infatuated blindness and perversion of
LINE 79: taste;—but, perhaps, you are not aware—" He paused.
LINE 80: "I am aware of nothing, sir—except that he delays his coming longer
LINE 81: than I expected; and if, at present, he prefers the society of his
LINE 82: friends to that of his wife, and the dissipations of the town to the
LINE 83: quiet of country life, I suppose I have those friends to thank for it.
LINE 84: _Their_ tastes and occupations are similar to his, and I don't see why
LINE 85: his conduct should awaken either their indignation or surprise."
LINE 86: "You wrong me cruelly," answered he. "I have shared but little of Mr.
LINE 87: Huntingdon's society for the last few weeks; and as for his tastes and
LINE 88: occupations, they are quite beyond me—lonely wanderer as I am. Where I
LINE 89: have but sipped and tasted, he drains the cup to the dregs; and if ever
LINE 90: for a moment I have sought to drown the voice of reflection in madness
LINE 91: and folly, or if I have wasted too much of my time and talents among
LINE 92: reckless and dissipated companions, God knows I would gladly renounce
LINE 93: them entirely and for ever, if I had but _half_ the blessings that man
LINE 94: so thanklessly casts behind his back—but _half_ the inducements to
LINE 95: virtue and domestic, orderly habits that he despises—but _such_ a home,
LINE 96: and _such_ a partner to share it! It is infamous!" he muttered, between
LINE 97: his teeth. "And don't think, Mrs. Huntingdon," he added aloud, "that I
LINE 98: could be guilty of inciting him to persevere in his present pursuits:
LINE 99: on the contrary, I have remonstrated with him again and again; I have
LINE 100: frequently expressed my surprise at his conduct, and reminded him of
LINE 101: his duties and his privileges—but to no purpose; he only—"
LINE 102: "Enough, Mr. Hargrave; you ought to be aware that whatever my husband's
LINE 103: faults may be, it can only aggravate the evil for me to hear them from
LINE 104: a stranger's lips."
LINE 105: "_Am_ I then a stranger?" said he in a sorrowful tone. "I am your
LINE 106: nearest neighbour, your son's godfather, and your husband's friend; may
LINE 107: I not be yours also?"
LINE 108: "Intimate acquaintance must precede real friendship; I know but little
LINE 109: of you, Mr. Hargrave, except from report."
LINE 110: "Have you then forgotten the six or seven weeks I spent under your roof
LINE 111: last autumn? _I_ have not forgotten them. And I know enough of _you_,
LINE 112: Mrs. Huntingdon, to think that your husband is the most enviable man in
LINE 113: the world, and I should be the next if you would deem me worthy of your
LINE 114: friendship."
LINE 115: "If you knew more of me, you would not think it, or if you did you
LINE 116: would not say it, and expect me to be flattered by the compliment."
LINE 117: I stepped backward as I spoke. He saw that I wished the conversation to
LINE 118: end; and immediately taking the hint, he gravely bowed, wished me
LINE 119: good-evening, and turned his horse towards the road. He appeared
LINE 120: grieved and hurt at my unkind reception of his sympathising overtures.
LINE 121: I was not sure that I had done right in speaking so harshly to him;
LINE 122: but, at the time, I had felt irritated—almost insulted by his conduct;
LINE 123: it seemed as if he was presuming upon the absence and neglect of my
LINE 124: husband, and insinuating even more than the truth against him.
LINE 125: Rachel had moved on, during our conversation, to some yards' distance.
LINE 126: He rode up to her, and asked to see the child. He took it carefully
LINE 127: into his arms, looked upon it with an almost paternal smile, and I
LINE 128: heard him say, as I approached,—
LINE 129: "And this, too, he has forsaken!"
LINE 130: He then tenderly kissed it, and restored it to the gratified nurse.
LINE 131: "Are you fond of children, Mr. Hargrave?" said I, a little softened
LINE 132: towards him.
LINE 133: "Not in general," he replied, "but that is such a _sweet_ child, and so
LINE 134: like its mother," he added in a lower tone.
LINE 135: "You are mistaken there; it is its father it resembles."
LINE 136: "Am I not right, nurse?" said he, appealing to Rachel.
LINE 137: "I think, sir, there's a bit of both," she replied.
LINE 138: He departed; and Rachel pronounced him a very nice gentleman. I had
LINE 139: still my doubts on the subject.
LINE 140: In the course of the following six weeks I met him several times, but
LINE 141: always, save once, in company with his mother, or his sister, or both.
LINE 142: When I called on them, he always happened to be at home, and, when they
LINE 143: called on me, it was always he that drove them over in the phaeton. His
LINE 144: mother, evidently, was quite delighted with his dutiful attentions and
LINE 145: newly-acquired domestic habits.
LINE 146: The time that I met him alone was on a bright, but not oppressively hot
LINE 147: day, in the beginning of July: I had taken little Arthur into the wood
LINE 148: that skirts the park, and there seated him on the moss-cushioned roots
LINE 149: of an old oak; and, having gathered a handful of bluebells and
LINE 150: wild-roses, I was kneeling before him, and presenting them, one by one,
LINE 151: to the grasp of his tiny fingers; enjoying the heavenly beauty of the
LINE 152: flowers, through the medium of his smiling eyes: forgetting, for the
LINE 153: moment, all my cares, laughing at his gleeful laughter, and delighting
LINE 154: myself with his delight,—when a shadow suddenly eclipsed the little
LINE 155: space of sunshine on the grass before us; and looking up, I beheld
LINE 156: Walter Hargrave standing and gazing upon us.
LINE 157: "Excuse me, Mrs. Huntingdon," said he, "but I was spell-bound; I had
LINE 158: neither the power to come forward and interrupt you, nor to withdraw
LINE 159: from the contemplation of such a scene. How vigorous my little godson
LINE 160: grows! and how merry he is this morning!" He approached the child, and
LINE 161: stooped to take his hand; but, on seeing that his caresses were likely
LINE 162: to produce tears and lamentations, instead of a reciprocation of
LINE 163: friendly demonstrations, he prudently drew back.
LINE 164: "What a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you, Mrs.
LINE 165: Huntingdon!" he observed, with a touch of sadness in his intonation, as
LINE 166: he admiringly contemplated the infant.
LINE 167: "It is," replied I; and then I asked after his mother and sister.
LINE 168: He politely answered my inquiries, and then returned again to the
LINE 169: subject I wished to avoid; though with a degree of timidity that
LINE 170: witnessed his fear to offend.
LINE 171: "You have not heard from Huntingdon lately?" he said.
LINE 172: "Not this week," I replied. Not these three weeks, I might have said.
LINE 173: "I had a letter from him this morning. I wish it were such a one as I
LINE 174: could show to his lady." He half drew from his waistcoat-pocket a
LINE 175: letter with Arthur's still beloved hand on the address, scowled at it,
LINE 176: and put it back again, adding—"But he tells me he is about to return
LINE 177: next week."
LINE 178: "He tells _me_ so every time he writes."
LINE 179: "Indeed! well, it is like him. But to me he always avowed it his
LINE 180: intention to stay till the present month."
LINE 181: It struck me like a blow, this proof of premeditated transgression and
LINE 182: systematic disregard of truth.
LINE 183: "It is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct," observed Mr.
LINE 184: Hargrave, thoughtfully regarding me, and reading, I suppose, my
LINE 185: feelings in my face.
LINE 186: "Then he is really coming next week?" said I, after a pause.
LINE 187: "You may rely upon it, if the assurance can give you any pleasure. And
LINE 188: is it _possible_, Mrs. Huntingdon, that you can rejoice at his return?"
LINE 189: he exclaimed, attentively perusing my features again.
LINE 190: "Of course, Mr. Hargrave; is he not my husband?"
LINE 191: "Oh, Huntingdon; you know not _what_ you slight!" he passionately
LINE 192: murmured.
LINE 193: I took up my baby, and, wishing him good-morning, departed, to indulge
LINE 194: my thoughts unscrutinized, within the sanctum of my home.
LINE 195: And _was_ I glad? Yes, delighted; though I was angered by Arthur's
LINE 196: conduct, and though I felt that he had wronged me, and was determined
LINE 197: he should feel it too.
