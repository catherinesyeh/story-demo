LINE 1: Seventh.—Yes, I _will_ hope! To-night I heard Grimsby and Hattersley
LINE 2: grumbling together about the inhospitality of their host. They did not
LINE 3: know I was near, for I happened to be standing behind the curtain in
LINE 4: the bow of the window, watching the moon rising over the clump of tall
LINE 5: dark elm-trees below the lawn, and wondering why Arthur was so
LINE 6: sentimental as to stand without, leaning against the outer pillar of
LINE 7: the portico, apparently watching it too.
LINE 8: "So, I suppose we've seen the last of our merry carousals in this
LINE 9: house," said Mr. Hattersley; "I _thought_ his good-fellowship wouldn't
LINE 10: last long. But," added he, laughing, "I didn't expect it would meet its
LINE 11: end this way. I rather thought our pretty hostess would be setting up
LINE 12: her porcupine quills, and threatening to turn us out of the house if we
LINE 13: didn't mind our manners."
LINE 14: "You didn't foresee _this_, then?" answered Grimsby, with a guttural
LINE 15: chuckle. "But he'll change again when he's sick of her. If we come here
LINE 16: a year or two hence, we shall have all our own way, you'll see."
LINE 17: "I don't know," replied the other: "she's not the style of woman you
LINE 18: soon tire of. But be that as it may, it's devilish provoking now that
LINE 19: we can't be jolly, because he chooses to be on his good behaviour."
LINE 20: "It's all these cursed women!" muttered Grimsby: "they're the very bane
LINE 21: of the world! They bring trouble and discomfort wherever they come,
LINE 22: with their false, fair faces and their deceitful tongues."
LINE 23: At this juncture I issued from my retreat, and smiling on Mr. Grimsby
LINE 24: as I passed, left the room and went out in search of Arthur. Having
LINE 25: seen him bend his course towards the shrubbery, I followed him thither,
LINE 26: and found him just entering the shadowy walk. I was so light of heart,
LINE 27: so overflowing with affection, that I sprang upon him and clasped him
LINE 28: in my arms. This startling conduct had a singular effect upon him:
LINE 29: first, he murmured, "Bless you, darling!" and returned my close embrace
LINE 30: with a fervour like old times, and _then_ he started, and, in a tone of
LINE 31: absolute terror, exclaimed,
LINE 32: "Helen! what the devil is this?" and I saw, by the faint light gleaming
LINE 33: through the overshadowing tree, that he was positively pale with the
LINE 34: shock.
LINE 35: How strange that the instinctive impulse of affection should come
LINE 36: first, and then the shock of the surprise! It shows, at least, that the
LINE 37: affection is genuine: he is not sick of me yet.
LINE 38: "I startled you, Arthur," said I, laughing in my glee. "How nervous you
LINE 39: are!"
LINE 40: "What the deuce did you do it for?" cried he, quite testily,
LINE 41: extricating himself from my arms, and wiping his forehead with his
LINE 42: handkerchief. "Go back, Helen—go back directly! You'll get your death
LINE 43: of cold!"
LINE 44: "I won't, till I've told you what I came for. They are blaming you,
LINE 45: Arthur, for your temperance and sobriety, and I'm come to thank you for
LINE 46: it. They say it is all 'these cursed women,' and that we are the bane
LINE 47: of the world; but don't let them laugh or grumble you out of your good
LINE 48: resolutions, or your affection for me."
LINE 49: He laughed. I squeezed him in my arms again, and cried in tearful
LINE 50: earnest, "Do, do persevere! and I'll love you better than ever I did
LINE 51: before!"
LINE 52: "Well, well, I will!" said he, hastily kissing me. "There, now, go. You
LINE 53: mad creature, how _could_ you come out in your light evening dress this
LINE 54: chill autumn night?"
LINE 55: "It is a glorious night," said I.
LINE 56: "It is a night that will give you your death, in another minute. Run
LINE 57: away, do!"
LINE 58: "Do you see my death among those trees, Arthur?" said I, for he was
LINE 59: gazing intently at the shrubs, as if he saw it coming, and I was
LINE 60: reluctant to leave him, in my new-found happiness and revival of hope
LINE 61: and love. But he grew angry at my delay, so I kissed him and ran back
LINE 62: to the house.
LINE 63: I was in such a good humour that night: Milicent told me I was the life
LINE 64: of the party, and whispered she had never seen me so brilliant.
LINE 65: Certainly, I talked enough for twenty, and smiled upon them all.
LINE 66: Grimsby, Hattersley, Hargrave, Lady Lowborough, all shared my sisterly
LINE 67: kindness. Grimsby stared and wondered; Hattersley laughed and jested
LINE 68: (in spite of the little wine he had been suffered to imbibe), but still
LINE 69: behaved as well as he knew how. Hargrave and Annabella, from different
LINE 70: motives and in different ways, emulated me, and doubtless both
LINE 71: surpassed me, the former in his discursive versatility and eloquence,
LINE 72: the latter in boldness and animation at least. Milicent, delighted to
LINE 73: see her husband, her brother, and her over-estimated friend acquitting
LINE 74: themselves so well, was lively and gay too, in her quiet way. Even Lord
LINE 75: Lowborough caught the general contagion: his dark greenish eyes were
LINE 76: lighted up beneath their moody brows; his sombre countenance was
LINE 77: beautified by smiles; all traces of gloom and proud or cold reserve had
LINE 78: vanished for the time; and he astonished us all, not only by his
LINE 79: general cheerfulness and animation, but by the positive flashes of true
LINE 80: force and brilliance he emitted from time to time. Arthur did not talk
LINE 81: much, but he laughed, and listened to the rest, and was in perfect
LINE 82: good-humour, though not excited by wine. So that, altogether, we made a
LINE 83: very merry, innocent, and entertaining party.
LINE 84: 9th.—Yesterday, when Rachel came to dress me for dinner, I saw that she
LINE 85: had been crying. I wanted to know the cause of it, but she seemed
LINE 86: reluctant to tell. Was she unwell? No. Had she heard bad news from her
LINE 87: friends? No. Had any of the servants vexed her?
LINE 88: "Oh, no, ma'am!" she answered; "it's not for myself."
LINE 89: "What then, Rachel? Have you been reading novels?"
LINE 90: "Bless you, no!" said she, with a sorrowful shake of the head; and then
LINE 91: she sighed and continued: "But to tell you the truth, ma'am, I don't
LINE 92: like master's ways of going on."
LINE 93: "What do you mean, Rachel? He's going on very properly at present."
LINE 94: "Well, ma'am, if you think so, it's right."
LINE 95: And she went on dressing my hair, in a hurried way, quite unlike her
LINE 96: usual calm, collected manner, murmuring, half to herself, she was sure
LINE 97: it was beautiful hair: she "could like to see 'em match it." When it
LINE 98: was done, she fondly stroked it, and gently patted my head.
LINE 99: "Is that affectionate ebullition intended for my hair, or myself,
LINE 100: nurse?" said I, laughingly turning round upon her; but a tear was even
LINE 101: now in her eye.
LINE 102: "What _do_ you mean, Rachel?" I exclaimed.
LINE 103: "Well, ma'am, I don't know; but if—"
LINE 104: "If what?"
LINE 105: "Well, if I was you, I wouldn't have that Lady Lowborough in the house
LINE 106: another minute—not another _minute_ I wouldn't!
LINE 107: I was thunderstruck; but before I could recover from the shock
LINE 108: sufficiently to demand an explanation, Milicent entered my room, as she
LINE 109: frequently does when she is dressed before me; and she stayed with me
LINE 110: till it was time to go down. She must have found me a very unsociable
LINE 111: companion this time, for Rachel's last words rang in my ears. But still
LINE 112: I hoped, I trusted they had no foundation but in some idle rumour of
LINE 113: the servants from what they had seen in Lady Lowborough's manner last
LINE 114: month; or perhaps from something that had passed between their master
LINE 115: and her during her former visit. At dinner I narrowly observed both her
LINE 116: and Arthur, and saw nothing extraordinary in the conduct of either,
LINE 117: nothing calculated to excite suspicion, except in distrustful minds,
LINE 118: which mine was not, and therefore I would not suspect.
LINE 119: Almost immediately after dinner Annabella went out with her husband to
LINE 120: share his moonlight ramble, for it was a splendid evening like the
LINE 121: last. Mr. Hargrave entered the drawing-room a little before the others,
LINE 122: and challenged me to a game of chess. He did it without any of that sad
LINE 123: but proud humility he usually assumes in addressing me, unless he is
LINE 124: excited with wine. I looked at his face to see if that was the case
LINE 125: now. His eye met mine keenly, but steadily: there was something about
LINE 126: him I did not understand, but he seemed sober enough. Not choosing to
LINE 127: engage with him, I referred him to Milicent.
LINE 128: "She plays badly," said he, "I want to match my skill with yours. Come
LINE 129: now! you can't pretend you are reluctant to lay down your work. I know
LINE 130: you never take it up except to pass an idle hour, when there is nothing
LINE 131: better you can do."
LINE 132: "But chess-players are so unsociable," I objected; "they are no company
LINE 133: for any but themselves."
LINE 134: "There is no one here but Milicent, and she—"
LINE 135: "Oh, I shall be delighted to watch you!" cried our mutual friend. "Two
LINE 136: _such_ players—it will be quite a treat! I wonder which will conquer."
LINE 137: I consented.
LINE 138: "Now, Mrs. Huntingdon," said Hargrave, as he arranged the men on the
LINE 139: board, speaking distinctly, and with a peculiar emphasis, as if he had
LINE 140: a double meaning to all his words, "you are a good player, but I am a
LINE 141: better: we shall have a long game, and you will give me some trouble;
LINE 142: but I can be as patient as you, and in the end I shall certainly win."
LINE 143: He fixed his eyes upon me with a glance I did not like, keen, crafty,
LINE 144: bold, and almost impudent;—already half triumphant in his anticipated
LINE 145: success.
LINE 146: "I hope not, Mr. Hargrave!" returned I, with vehemence that must have
LINE 147: startled Milicent at least; but _he_ only smiled and murmured, "Time
LINE 148: will show."
LINE 149: We set to work: he sufficiently interested in the game, but calm and
LINE 150: fearless in the consciousness of superior skill: I, intensely eager to
LINE 151: disappoint his expectations, for I considered this the type of a more
LINE 152: serious contest, as I imagined he did, and I felt an almost
LINE 153: superstitious dread of being beaten: at all events, I could ill endure
LINE 154: that present success should add one tittle to his conscious power (his
LINE 155: insolent self-confidence I ought to say), or encourage for a moment his
LINE 156: dream of future conquest. His play was cautious and deep, but I
LINE 157: struggled hard against him. For some time the combat was doubtful: at
LINE 158: length, to my joy, the victory seemed inclining to my side: I had taken
LINE 159: several of his best pieces, and manifestly baffled his projects. He put
LINE 160: his hand to his brow and paused, in evident perplexity. I rejoiced in
LINE 161: my advantage, but dared not glory in it yet. At length, he lifted his
LINE 162: head, and quietly making his move, looked at me and said, calmly, "Now
LINE 163: you think you will win, don't you?"
LINE 164: "I hope so," replied I, taking his pawn that he had pushed into the way
LINE 165: of my bishop with so careless an air that I thought it was an
LINE 166: oversight, but was not generous enough, under the circumstances, to
LINE 167: direct his attention to it, and too heedless, at the moment, to foresee
LINE 168: the after-consequences of my move. "It is those bishops that trouble
LINE 169: me," said he; "but the bold knight can overleap the reverend
LINE 170: gentlemen," taking my last bishop with his knight; "and now, those
LINE 171: sacred persons once removed, I shall carry all before me."
LINE 172: "Oh, Walter, how you talk!" cried Milicent; "she has far more pieces
LINE 173: than you still."
LINE 174: "I intend to give you some trouble yet," said I; "and perhaps, sir, you
LINE 175: will find yourself checkmated before you are aware. Look to your
LINE 176: queen."
LINE 177: The combat deepened. The game was a long one, and I _did_ give him some
LINE 178: trouble: but he was a better player than I.
LINE 179: "What keen gamesters you are!" said Mr. Hattersley, who had now
LINE 180: entered, and been watching us for some time. "Why, Mrs. Huntingdon,
LINE 181: your hand trembles as if you had staked your all upon it! and, Walter,
LINE 182: you dog, you look as deep and cool as if you were certain of success,
LINE 183: and as keen and cruel as if you would drain her heart's blood! But if I
LINE 184: were you, I wouldn't beat her, for very fear: she'll hate you if you
LINE 185: do—she will, by heaven! I see it in her eye."
LINE 186: "Hold your tongue, will you?" said I: his talk distracted me, for I was
LINE 187: driven to extremities. A few more moves, and I was inextricably
LINE 188: entangled in the snare of my antagonist.
LINE 189: "Check," cried he: I sought in agony some means of escape. "Mate!" he
LINE 190: added, quietly, but with evident delight. He had suspended the
LINE 191: utterance of that last fatal syllable the better to enjoy my dismay. I
LINE 192: was foolishly disconcerted by the event. Hattersley laughed; Milicent
LINE 193: was troubled to see me so disturbed. Hargrave placed his hand on mine
LINE 194: that rested on the table, and squeezing it with a firm but gentle
LINE 195: pressure, murmured, "Beaten, beaten!" and gazed into my face with a
LINE 196: look where exultation was blended with an expression of ardour and
LINE 197: tenderness yet more insulting.
LINE 198: "_No, never_, Mr. Hargrave!" exclaimed I, quickly withdrawing my hand.
LINE 199: "Do you deny?" replied he, smilingly pointing to the board. "No, no," I
LINE 200: answered, recollecting how strange my conduct must appear: "you have
LINE 201: beaten me in that game."
LINE 202: "Will you try another, then?"
LINE 203: "No."
LINE 204: "You acknowledge my superiority?"
LINE 205: "Yes, as a chess-player."
LINE 206: I rose to resume my work.
LINE 207: "Where is Annabella?" said Hargrave, gravely, after glancing round the
LINE 208: room.
LINE 209: "Gone out with Lord Lowborough," answered I, for he looked at me for a
LINE 210: reply.
LINE 211: "And not yet returned!" he said, seriously.
LINE 212: "I suppose not."
LINE 213: "Where is Huntingdon?" looking round again.
LINE 214: "Gone out with Grimsby, as you know," said Hattersley, suppressing a
LINE 215: laugh, which broke forth as he concluded the sentence. Why did he
LINE 216: laugh? Why did Hargrave connect them thus together? Was it true, then?
LINE 217: And was this the dreadful secret he had wished to reveal to me? I must
LINE 218: know, and that quickly. I instantly rose and left the room to go in
LINE 219: search of Rachel and demand an explanation of her words; but Mr.
LINE 220: Hargrave followed me into the anteroom, and before I could open its
LINE 221: outer door, gently laid his hand upon the lock. "May I tell you
LINE 222: something, Mrs. Huntingdon?" said he, in a subdued tone, with serious,
LINE 223: downcast eyes.
LINE 224: "If it be anything worth hearing," replied I, struggling to be
LINE 225: composed, for I trembled in every limb.
LINE 226: He quietly pushed a chair towards me. I merely leant my hand upon it,
LINE 227: and bid him go on.
LINE 228: "Do not be alarmed," said he: "what I wish to say is nothing in itself;
LINE 229: and I will leave you to draw your own inferences from it. You say that
LINE 230: Annabella is not yet returned?"
LINE 231: "Yes, yes—go on!" said I, impatiently; for I feared my forced calmness
LINE 232: would leave me before the end of his disclosure, whatever it might be.
LINE 233: "And you hear," continued he, "that Huntingdon is gone out with
LINE 234: Grimsby?"
LINE 235: "Well?"
LINE 236: "I heard the latter say to your husband—or the man who calls himself
LINE 237: so—"
LINE 238: "Go on, sir!"
LINE 239: He bowed submissively, and continued: "I heard him say,—'I shall manage
LINE 240: it, you'll see! They're gone down by the water; I shall meet them
LINE 241: there, and tell him I want a bit of talk with him about some things
LINE 242: that we needn't trouble the lady with; and she'll say she can be
LINE 243: walking back to the house; and then I shall apologise, you know, and
LINE 244: all that, and tip her a wink to take the way of the shrubbery. I'll
LINE 245: keep him talking there, about those matters I mentioned, and anything
LINE 246: else I can think of, as long as I can, and then bring him round the
LINE 247: other way, stopping to look at the trees, the fields, and anything else
LINE 248: I can find to discourse of.'" Mr. Hargrave paused, and looked at me.
LINE 249: Without a word of comment or further questioning, I rose, and darted
LINE 250: from the room and out of the house. The torment of suspense was not to
LINE 251: be endured: I would not suspect my husband falsely, on this man's
LINE 252: accusation, and I would not trust him unworthily—I must know the truth
LINE 253: at once. I flew to the shrubbery. Scarcely had I reached it, when a
LINE 254: sound of voices arrested my breathless speed.
LINE 255: "We have lingered too long; he will be back," said Lady Lowborough's
LINE 256: voice.
LINE 257: "Surely not, dearest!" was _his_ reply; "but you can run across the
LINE 258: lawn, and get in as quietly as you can; I'll follow in a while."
LINE 259: My knees trembled under me; my brain swam round. I was ready to faint.
LINE 260: She must not see me thus. I shrunk among the bushes, and leant against
LINE 261: the trunk of a tree to let her pass.
LINE 262: "Ah, Huntingdon!" said she reproachfully, pausing where I had stood
LINE 263: with him the night before—"it was here you kissed that woman!" she
LINE 264: looked back into the leafy shade. Advancing thence, he answered, with a
LINE 265: careless laugh,—
LINE 266: "Well, dearest, I couldn't help it. You know I must keep straight with
LINE 267: her as long as I can. Haven't I seen you kiss your dolt of a husband
LINE 268: scores of times?—and do _I_ ever complain?"
LINE 269: "But tell me, don't you love her still—a _little?_" said she, placing
LINE 270: her hand on his arm, looking earnestly in his face—for I could see
LINE 271: them, plainly, the moon shining full upon them from between the
LINE 272: branches of the tree that sheltered me.
LINE 273: "Not _one bit_, by all that's sacred!" he replied, kissing her glowing
LINE 274: cheek.
LINE 275: "Good heavens, I _must_ be gone!" cried she, suddenly breaking from
LINE 276: him, and away she flew.
LINE 277: There he stood before me; but I had not strength to confront him now:
LINE 278: my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth; I was well-nigh sinking to
LINE 279: the earth, and I almost wondered he did not hear the beating of my
LINE 280: heart above the low sighing of the wind and the fitful rustle of the
LINE 281: falling leaves. My senses seemed to fail me, but still I saw his
LINE 282: shadowy form pass before me, and through the rushing sound in my ears I
LINE 283: distinctly heard him say, as he stood looking up the lawn,—"There goes
LINE 284: the fool! Run, Annabella, run! There—in with you! Ah,—he didn't see!
LINE 285: That's right, Grimsby, keep him back!" And even his low laugh reached
LINE 286: me as he walked away.
LINE 287: "God help me now!" I murmured, sinking on my knees among the damp weeds
LINE 288: and brushwood that surrounded me, and looking up at the moonlit sky,
LINE 289: through the scant foliage above. It seemed all dim and quivering now to
LINE 290: my darkened sight. My burning, bursting heart strove to pour forth its
LINE 291: agony to God, but could not frame its anguish into prayer; until a gust
LINE 292: of wind swept over me, which, while it scattered the dead leaves, like
LINE 293: blighted hopes, around, cooled my forehead, and seemed a little to
LINE 294: revive my sinking frame. Then, while I lifted up my soul in speechless,
LINE 295: earnest supplication, some heavenly influence seemed to strengthen me
LINE 296: within: I breathed more freely; my vision cleared; I saw distinctly the
LINE 297: pure moon shining on, and the light clouds skimming the clear, dark
LINE 298: sky; and then I saw the eternal stars twinkling down upon me; I knew
LINE 299: their God was mine, and He was strong to save and swift to hear. "I
LINE 300: will never leave thee, nor forsake thee," seemed whispered from above
LINE 301: their myriad orbs. No, no; I felt He would not leave me comfortless: in
LINE 302: spite of earth and hell I should have strength for all my trials, and
LINE 303: win a glorious rest at last!
LINE 304: Refreshed, invigorated, if not composed, I rose and returned to the
LINE 305: house. Much of my new-born strength and courage forsook me, I confess,
LINE 306: as I entered it, and shut out the fresh wind and the glorious sky:
LINE 307: everything I saw and heard seemed to sicken my heart—the hall, the
LINE 308: lamp, the staircase, the doors of the different apartments, the social
LINE 309: sound of talk and laughter from the drawing-room. How could I bear my
LINE 310: future life! In this house, among those people—oh, how could I endure
LINE 311: to live! John just then entered the hall, and seeing me, told me he had
LINE 312: been sent in search of me, adding that he had taken in the tea, and
LINE 313: master wished to know if I were coming.
LINE 314: "Ask Mrs. Hattersley to be so kind as to make the tea, John," said I.
LINE 315: "Say I am not well to-night, and wish to be excused."
LINE 316: I retired into the large, empty dining-room, where all was silence and
LINE 317: darkness, but for the soft sighing of the wind without, and the faint
LINE 318: gleam of moonlight that pierced the blinds and curtains; and there I
LINE 319: walked rapidly up and down, thinking of my bitter thoughts alone. How
LINE 320: different was this from the evening of yesterday! _That_, it seems, was
LINE 321: the last expiring flash of my life's happiness. Poor, blinded fool that
LINE 322: I was to be so happy! I could now see the reason of Arthur's strange
LINE 323: reception of me in the shrubbery; the burst of kindness was for his
LINE 324: paramour, the start of horror for his wife. Now, too, I could better
LINE 325: understand the conversation between Hattersley and Grimsby; it was
LINE 326: doubtless of his love for _her_ they spoke, not for me.
LINE 327: I heard the drawing-room door open: a light quick step came out of the
LINE 328: ante-room, crossed the hall, and ascended the stairs. It was Milicent,
LINE 329: poor Milicent, gone to see how I was—no one else cared for me; but
LINE 330: _she_ still was kind. I shed no tears before, but now they came, fast
LINE 331: and free. Thus she did me good, without approaching me. Disappointed in
LINE 332: her search, I heard her come down, more slowly than she had ascended.
LINE 333: Would she come in there, and find me out? No, she turned in the
LINE 334: opposite direction and re-entered the drawing-room. I was glad, for I
LINE 335: knew not how to meet her, or what to say. I wanted no confidante in my
LINE 336: distress. I deserved none, and I wanted none. I had taken the burden
LINE 337: upon myself; let me bear it alone.
LINE 338: As the usual hour of retirement approached I dried my eyes, and tried
LINE 339: to clear my voice and calm my mind. I must see Arthur to-night, and
LINE 340: speak to him; but I would do it calmly: there should be no
LINE 341: scene—nothing to complain or to boast of to his companions—nothing to
LINE 342: laugh at with his lady-love. When the company were retiring to their
LINE 343: chambers I gently opened the door, and just as he passed, beckoned him
LINE 344: in.
LINE 345: "What's to do with _you_, Helen?" said he. "Why couldn't you come to
LINE 346: make tea for us? and what the deuce are you here for, in the dark? What
LINE 347: ails you, young woman: you look like a ghost!" he continued, surveying
LINE 348: me by the light of his candle.
LINE 349: "No matter," I answered, "to you; you have no longer any regard for me
LINE 350: it appears; and I have no longer any for you."
LINE 351: "Hal-lo! what the devil is this?" he muttered.
LINE 352: "I would leave you to-morrow," continued I, "and never again come under
LINE 353: this roof, but for my child"—I paused a moment to steady, my voice.
LINE 354: "What in the devil's name _is_ this, Helen?" cried he. "What can you be
LINE 355: driving at?"
LINE 356: "You know perfectly well. Let us waste no time in useless explanation,
LINE 357: but tell me, will you—?"
LINE 358: He vehemently swore he knew nothing about it, and insisted upon hearing
LINE 359: what poisonous old woman had been blackening his name, and what
LINE 360: infamous lies I had been fool enough to believe.
LINE 361: "Spare yourself the trouble of forswearing yourself and racking your
LINE 362: brains to stifle truth with falsehood," I coldly replied. "I have
LINE 363: trusted to the testimony of no third person. I was in the shrubbery
LINE 364: this evening, and I saw and heard for myself."
LINE 365: This was enough. He uttered a suppressed exclamation of consternation
LINE 366: and dismay, and muttering, "I _shall_ catch it now!" set down his
LINE 367: candle on the nearest chair, and rearing his back against the wall,
LINE 368: stood confronting me with folded arms.
LINE 369: "Well, what then?" said he, with the calm insolence of mingled
LINE 370: shamelessness and desperation.
LINE 371: "Only this," returned I; "will you let me take our child and what
LINE 372: remains of my fortune, and go?"
LINE 373: "Go where?"
LINE 374: "Anywhere, where he will be safe from your contaminating influence, and
LINE 375: I shall be delivered from your presence, and you from mine."
LINE 376: "No."
LINE 377: "Will you let me have the child then, without the money?"
LINE 378: "No, nor yourself without the child. Do you think I'm going to be made
LINE 379: the talk of the country for your fastidious caprices?"
LINE 380: "Then I must stay here, to be hated and despised. But henceforth we are
LINE 381: husband and wife only in the name."
LINE 382: "Very good."
LINE 383: "I am your child's mother, and _your_ housekeeper, nothing more. So you
LINE 384: need not trouble yourself any longer to feign the love you cannot feel:
LINE 385: I will exact no more heartless caresses from you, nor offer nor endure
LINE 386: them either. I will not be mocked with the empty husk of conjugal
LINE 387: endearments, when you have given the substance to another!"
LINE 388: "Very good, if _you_ please. We shall see who will tire first, my
LINE 389: lady."
LINE 390: "If I tire, it will be of living in the world with you: not of living
LINE 391: without your mockery of love. When _you_ tire of your sinful ways, and
LINE 392: show yourself truly repentant, I will forgive you, and, perhaps, try to
LINE 393: love you again, though that will be hard indeed."
LINE 394: "Humph! and meantime you will go and talk me over to Mrs. Hargrave, and
LINE 395: write long letters to aunt Maxwell to complain of the wicked wretch you
LINE 396: have married?"
LINE 397: "I shall complain to no one. Hitherto I have struggled hard to hide
LINE 398: your vices from every eye, and invest you with virtues you never
LINE 399: possessed; but now you must look to yourself."
LINE 400: I left him muttering bad language to himself, and went up-stairs.
LINE 401: "You are poorly, ma'am," said Rachel, surveying me with deep anxiety.
LINE 402: "It is too true, Rachel," said I, answering her sad looks rather than
LINE 403: her words.
LINE 404: "I knew it, or I wouldn't have mentioned such a thing."
LINE 405: "But don't _you_ trouble yourself about it," said I, kissing her pale,
LINE 406: time-wasted cheek. "I can bear it better than you imagine."
LINE 407: "Yes, you were always for 'bearing.' But if I was you I wouldn't bear
LINE 408: it; I'd give way to it, and cry right hard! and I'd talk too, I just
LINE 409: _would_—I'd let him know what it was to—"
LINE 410: "I have talked," said I; "I've said enough."
LINE 411: "Then I'd cry," persisted she. "I wouldn't look so white and so calm,
LINE 412: and burst my heart with keeping it in."
LINE 413: "I _have_ cried," said I, smiling, in spite of my misery; "and I _am_
LINE 414: calm now, really: so don't discompose me again, nurse: let us say no
LINE 415: more about it, and _don't_ mention it to the servants. There, you may
LINE 416: go now. Good-night; and don't disturb your rest for me: I shall sleep
LINE 417: well—if I can."
LINE 418: Notwithstanding this resolution, I found my bed so intolerable that,
LINE 419: before two o'clock, I rose, and lighting my candle by the rushlight
LINE 420: that was still burning, I got my desk and sat down in my dressing-gown
LINE 421: to recount the events of the past evening. It was better to be so
LINE 422: occupied than to be lying in bed torturing my brain with recollections
LINE 423: of the far past and anticipations of the dreadful future. I have found
LINE 424: relief in describing the very circumstances that have destroyed my
LINE 425: peace, as well as the little trivial details attendant upon their
LINE 426: discovery. No sleep I could have got this night would have done so much
LINE 427: towards composing my mind, and preparing me to meet the trials of the
LINE 428: day. I fancy so, at least; and yet, when I cease writing, I find my
LINE 429: head aches terribly; and when I look into the glass, I am startled at
LINE 430: my haggard, worn appearance.
LINE 431: Rachel has been to dress me, and says I have had a sad night of it, she
LINE 432: can see. Milicent has just looked in to ask me how I was. I told her I
LINE 433: was better, but to excuse my appearance admitted I had had a restless
LINE 434: night. I wish this day were over! I shudder at the thoughts of going
LINE 435: down to breakfast. How shall I encounter them all? Yet let me remember
LINE 436: it is not _I_ that am guilty: _I_ have no cause to fear; and if _they_
LINE 437: scorn me as a victim of their guilt, I can pity their folly and despise
LINE 438: their scorn.
