LINE 1: I perceive, with joy, my most valued friend, that the cloud of your
LINE 2: displeasure has passed away; the light of your countenance blesses me
LINE 3: once more, and you desire the continuation of my story: therefore,
LINE 4: without more ado, you shall have it.
LINE 5: I think the day I last mentioned was a certain Sunday, the latest in
LINE 6: the October of 1827. On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog and
LINE 7: gun, in pursuit of such game as I could find within the territory of
LINE 8: Linden-Car; but finding none at all, I turned my arms against the hawks
LINE 9: and carrion crows, whose depredations, as I suspected, had deprived me
LINE 10: of better prey. To this end I left the more frequented regions, the
LINE 11: wooded valleys, the corn-fields, and the meadow-lands, and proceeded to
LINE 12: mount the steep acclivity of Wildfell, the wildest and the loftiest
LINE 13: eminence in our neighbourhood, where, as you ascend, the hedges, as
LINE 14: well as the trees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at length,
LINE 15: giving place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and
LINE 16: moss, the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated
LINE 17: blackthorns. The fields, being rough and stony, and wholly unfit for
LINE 18: the plough, were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle;
LINE 19: the soil was thin and poor: bits of grey rock here and there peeped out
LINE 20: from the grassy hillocks; bilberry-plants and heather—relics of more
LINE 21: savage wildness—grew under the walls; and in many of the enclosures,
LINE 22: ragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty herbage; but
LINE 23: these were not _my_ property.
LINE 24: Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood
LINE 25: Wildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of
LINE 26: dark grey stone, venerable and picturesque to look at, but doubtless,
LINE 27: cold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and
LINE 28: little latticed panes, its time-eaten air-holes, and its too lonely,
LINE 29: too unsheltered situation,—only shielded from the war of wind and
LINE 30: weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with
LINE 31: storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the Hall itself. Behind it
LINE 32: lay a few desolate fields, and then the brown heath-clad summit of the
LINE 33: hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate,
LINE 34: with large balls of grey granite—similar to those which decorated the
LINE 35: roof and gables—surmounting the gate-posts) was a garden,—once stocked
LINE 36: with such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and
LINE 37: climate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener's
LINE 38: torturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give
LINE 39: them,—now, having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed,
LINE 40: abandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the
LINE 41: rain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed.
LINE 42: The close green walls of privet, that had bordered the principal walk,
LINE 43: were two-thirds withered away, and the rest grown beyond all reasonable
LINE 44: bounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had lost its
LINE 45: neck and half its body: the castellated towers of laurel in the middle
LINE 46: of the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the
LINE 47: gateway, and the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such
LINE 48: fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in
LINE 49: the waters under the earth; but, to my young imagination, they
LINE 50: presented all of them a goblinish appearance, that harmonised well with
LINE 51: the ghostly legions and dark traditions our old nurse had told us
LINE 52: respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants.
LINE 53: [Illustration]
LINE 54: I had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when I came within
LINE 55: sight of the mansion; and then, relinquishing further depredations, I
LINE 56: sauntered on, to have a look at the old place, and see what changes had
LINE 57: been wrought in it by its new inhabitant. I did not like to go quite to
LINE 58: the front and stare in at the gate; but I paused beside the garden
LINE 59: wall, and looked, and saw no change—except in one wing, where the
LINE 60: broken windows and dilapidated roof had evidently been repaired, and
LINE 61: where a thin wreath of smoke was curling up from the stack of chimneys.
LINE 62: While I thus stood, leaning on my gun, and looking up at the dark
LINE 63: gables, sunk in an idle reverie, weaving a tissue of wayward fancies,
LINE 64: in which old associations and the fair young hermit, now within those
LINE 65: walls, bore a nearly equal part, I heard a slight rustling and
LINE 66: scrambling just within the garden; and, glancing in the direction
LINE 67: whence the sound proceeded, I beheld a tiny hand elevated above the
LINE 68: wall: it clung to the topmost stone, and then another little hand was
LINE 69: raised to take a firmer hold, and then appeared a small white forehead,
LINE 70: surmounted with wreaths of light brown hair, with a pair of deep blue
LINE 71: eyes beneath, and the upper portion of a diminutive ivory nose.
LINE 72: The eyes did not notice me, but sparkled with glee on beholding Sancho,
LINE 73: my beautiful black and white setter, that was coursing about the field
LINE 74: with its muzzle to the ground. The little creature raised its face and
LINE 75: called aloud to the dog. The good-natured animal paused, looked up, and
LINE 76: wagged his tail, but made no further advances. The child (a little boy,
LINE 77: apparently about five years old) scrambled up to the top of the wall,
LINE 78: and called again and again; but finding this of no avail, apparently
LINE 79: made up his mind, like Mahomet, to go to the mountain, since the
LINE 80: mountain would not come to him, and attempted to get over; but a
LINE 81: crabbed old cherry-tree, that grew hard by, caught him by the frock in
LINE 82: one of its crooked scraggy arms that stretched over the wall. In
LINE 83: attempting to disengage himself his foot slipped, and down he
LINE 84: tumbled—but not to the earth;—the tree still kept him suspended. There
LINE 85: was a silent struggle, and then a piercing shriek;—but, in an instant,
LINE 86: I had dropped my gun on the grass, and caught the little fellow in my
LINE 87: arms.
LINE 88: I wiped his eyes with his frock, told him he was all right and called
LINE 89: Sancho to pacify him. He was just putting little hand on the dog's neck
LINE 90: and beginning to smile through his tears, when I heard behind me a
LINE 91: click of the iron gate, and a rustle of female garments, and lo! Mrs.
LINE 92: Graham darted upon me—her neck uncovered, her black locks streaming in
LINE 93: the wind.
LINE 94: "Give me the child!" she said, in a voice scarce louder than a whisper,
LINE 95: but with a tone of startling vehemence, and, seizing the boy, she
LINE 96: snatched him from me, as if some dire contamination were in my touch,
LINE 97: and then stood with one hand firmly clasping his, the other on his
LINE 98: shoulder, fixing upon me her large, luminous dark eyes—pale,
LINE 99: breathless, quivering with agitation.
LINE 100: "I was not harming the child, madam," said I, scarce knowing whether to
LINE 101: be most astonished or displeased; "he was tumbling off the wall there;
LINE 102: and I was so fortunate as to catch him, while he hung suspended
LINE 103: headlong from that tree, and prevent I know not what catastrophe."
LINE 104: "I beg your pardon, sir," stammered she;—suddenly calming down,—the
LINE 105: light of reason seeming to break upon her beclouded spirit, and a faint
LINE 106: blush mantling on her cheek—"I did not know you;—and I thought—"
LINE 107: She stooped to kiss the child, and fondly clasped her arm round his
LINE 108: neck.
LINE 109: "You thought I was going to kidnap your son, I suppose?"
LINE 110: She stroked his head with a half-embarrassed laugh, and replied,—"I did
LINE 111: not know he had attempted to climb the wall.—I have the pleasure of
LINE 112: addressing Mr. Markham, I believe?" she added, somewhat abruptly.
LINE 113: I bowed, but ventured to ask how she knew me.
LINE 114: "Your sister called here, a few days ago, with Mrs. Markham."
LINE 115: "Is the resemblance so strong then?" I asked, in some surprise, and not
LINE 116: so greatly flattered at the idea as I ought to have been.
LINE 117: "There is a likeness about the eyes and complexion I think," replied
LINE 118: she, somewhat dubiously surveying my face;—"and I think I saw you at
LINE 119: church on Sunday."
LINE 120: I smiled.—There was something either in that smile or the recollections
LINE 121: it awakened that was particularly displeasing to her, for she suddenly
LINE 122: assumed again that proud, chilly look that had so unspeakably roused my
LINE 123: aversion at church—a look of repellent scorn, so easily assumed, and so
LINE 124: entirely without the least distortion of a single feature, that, while
LINE 125: there, it seemed like the natural expression of the face, and was the
LINE 126: more provoking to me, because I could not think it affected.
LINE 127: "Good-morning, Mr. Markham," said she; and without another word or
LINE 128: glance, she withdrew, with her child, into the garden; and I returned
LINE 129: home, angry and dissatisfied—I could scarcely tell you why, and
LINE 130: therefore will not attempt it.
LINE 131: I only stayed to put away my gun and powder-horn, and give some
LINE 132: requisite directions to one of the farming-men, and then repaired to
LINE 133: the vicarage, to solace my spirit and soothe my ruffled temper with the
LINE 134: company and conversation of Eliza Millward.
LINE 135: I found her, as usual, busy with some piece of soft embroidery (the
LINE 136: mania for Berlin wools had not yet commenced), while her sister was
LINE 137: seated at the chimney-corner, with the cat on her knee, mending a heap
LINE 138: of stockings.
LINE 139: "Mary—Mary! put them away!" Eliza was hastily saying, just as I entered
LINE 140: the room.
LINE 141: "Not I, indeed!" was the phlegmatic reply; and my appearance prevented
LINE 142: further discussion.
LINE 143: "You're so unfortunate, Mr. Markham!" observed the younger sister, with
LINE 144: one of her arch, sidelong glances. "Papa's just gone out into the
LINE 145: parish, and not likely to be back for an hour!"
LINE 146: "Never mind; I can manage to spend a few minutes with his daughters, if
LINE 147: they'll allow me," said I, bringing a chair to the fire, and seating
LINE 148: myself therein, without waiting to be asked.
LINE 149: "Well, if you'll be very good and amusing, we shall not object."
LINE 150: "Let your permission be unconditional, pray; for I came not to give
LINE 151: pleasure, but to seek it," I answered.
LINE 152: However, I thought it but reasonable to make some slight exertion to
LINE 153: render my company agreeable; and what little effort I made, was
LINE 154: apparently pretty successful, for Miss Eliza was never in a better
LINE 155: humour. We seemed, indeed, to be mutually pleased with each other, and
LINE 156: managed to maintain between us a cheerful and animated though not very
LINE 157: profound conversation. It was little better than a _tête-à-tête_, for
LINE 158: Miss Millward never opened her lips, except occasionally to correct
LINE 159: some random assertion or exaggerated expression of her sister's, and
LINE 160: once to ask her to pick up the ball of cotton that had rolled under the
LINE 161: table. I did this myself, however, as in duty bound.
LINE 162: "Thank you, Mr. Markham," said she, as I presented it to her. "I would
LINE 163: have picked it up myself; only I did not want to disturb the cat."
LINE 164: "Mary, dear, _that_ won't excuse you in Mr. Markham's eyes," said
LINE 165: Eliza; "he hates cats, I daresay, as cordially as he does old
LINE 166: maids—like all other gentlemen. Don't you, Mr. Markham?"
LINE 167: "I believe it is natural for our unamiable sex to dislike the
LINE 168: creatures," replied I; "for you ladies lavish so many caresses upon
LINE 169: them."
LINE 170: "Bless them—little darlings!" cried she, in a sudden burst of
LINE 171: enthusiasm, turning round and overwhelming her sister's pet with a
LINE 172: shower of kisses.
LINE 173: "Don't, Eliza!" said Miss Millward, somewhat gruffly, as she
LINE 174: impatiently pushed her away.
LINE 175: But it was time for me to be going: make what haste I would, I should
LINE 176: still be too late for tea; and my mother was the soul of order and
LINE 177: punctuality.
LINE 178: My fair friend was evidently unwilling to bid me adieu. I tenderly
LINE 179: squeezed her little hand at parting; and she repaid me with one of her
LINE 180: softest smiles and most bewitching glances. I went home very happy,
LINE 181: with a heart brimful of complacency for myself, and overflowing with
LINE 182: love for Eliza.
