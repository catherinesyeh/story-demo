LINE 1: One morning, about the beginning of November, while I was inditing some
LINE 2: business letters, shortly after breakfast, Eliza Millward came to call
LINE 3: upon my sister. Rose had neither the discrimination nor the virulence
LINE 4: to regard the little demon as I did, and they still preserved their
LINE 5: former intimacy. At the moment of her arrival, however, there was no
LINE 6: one in the room but Fergus and myself, my mother and sister being both
LINE 7: of them absent, "on household cares intent"; but _I_ was not going to
LINE 8: lay myself out for her amusement, whoever else might so incline: I
LINE 9: merely honoured her with a careless salutation and a few words of
LINE 10: course, and then went on with my writing, leaving my brother to be more
LINE 11: polite if he chose. But she wanted to tease me.
LINE 12: "What a pleasure it is to find you at home, Mr. Markham!" said she,
LINE 13: with a disingenuously malicious smile. "I so seldom see you now, for
LINE 14: you never come to the vicarage. Papa, is quite offended, I can tell
LINE 15: you," she added playfully, looking into my face with an impertinent
LINE 16: laugh, as she seated herself, half beside and half before my desk, off
LINE 17: the corner of the table.
LINE 18: "I have had a good deal to do of late," said I, without looking up from
LINE 19: my letter.
LINE 20: "Have you, indeed! Somebody said you had been strangely neglecting your
LINE 21: business these last few months."
LINE 22: "Somebody said wrong, for, these last two months especially, I have
LINE 23: been particularly plodding and diligent."
LINE 24: "Ah! well, there's nothing like active employment, I suppose, to
LINE 25: console the afflicted;—and, excuse me, Mr. Markham, but you look so
LINE 26: very far from well, and have been, by all accounts, so moody and
LINE 27: thoughtful of late,—I could almost think you have some secret care
LINE 28: preying on your spirits. _Formerly_," said she timidly, "I could have
LINE 29: ventured to ask you what it was, and what I could do to comfort you: I
LINE 30: dare not do it now."
LINE 31: "You're very kind, Miss Eliza. When I think you can do anything to
LINE 32: comfort me, I'll make bold to tell you."
LINE 33: "Pray do!—I suppose I mayn't guess what it is that troubles you?"
LINE 34: "There's no necessity, for I'll tell you plainly. The thing that
LINE 35: troubles me the most at present is a young lady sitting at my elbow,
LINE 36: and preventing me from finishing my letter, and, thereafter, repairing
LINE 37: to my daily business."
LINE 38: Before she could reply to this ungallant speech, Rose entered the room;
LINE 39: and Miss Eliza rising to greet her, they both seated themselves near
LINE 40: the fire, where that idle lad Fergus was standing, leaning his shoulder
LINE 41: against the corner of the chimney-piece, with his legs crossed and his
LINE 42: hands in his breeches-pockets.
LINE 43: "Now, Rose, I'll tell you a piece of news—I hope you have not heard it
LINE 44: before: for good, bad, or indifferent, one always likes to be the first
LINE 45: to tell. It's about that sad Mrs. Graham—"
LINE 46: "Hush-sh-sh!" whispered Fergus, in a tone of solemn import. "'We never
LINE 47: mention her; her name is never heard.'" And glancing up, I caught him
LINE 48: with his eye askance on me, and his finger pointed to his forehead;
LINE 49: then, winking at the young lady with a doleful shake of the head, he
LINE 50: whispered—"A monomania—but don't mention it—all right but that."
LINE 51: "I should be sorry to injure any one's feelings," returned she,
LINE 52: speaking below her breath. "Another time, perhaps."
LINE 53: "Speak out, Miss Eliza!" said I, not deigning to notice the other's
LINE 54: buffooneries: "you needn't fear to say anything in my presence."
LINE 55: "Well," answered she, "perhaps you know already that Mrs. Graham's
LINE 56: husband is not really dead, and that she had run away from him?" I
LINE 57: started, and felt my face glow; but I bent it over my letter, and went
LINE 58: on folding it up as she proceeded. "But perhaps you did _not_ know that
LINE 59: she is now gone back to him again, and that a perfect reconciliation
LINE 60: has taken place between them? Only think," she continued, turning to
LINE 61: the confounded Rose, "what a fool the man must be!"
LINE 62: "And who gave you this piece of intelligence, Miss Eliza?" said I,
LINE 63: interrupting my sister's exclamations.
LINE 64: "I had it from a very authentic source."
LINE 65: "From whom, may I ask?"
LINE 66: "From one of the servants at Woodford."
LINE 67: "Oh! I was not aware that you were on such intimate terms with Mr.
LINE 68: Lawrence's household."
LINE 69: "It was not from the man himself that I heard it, but he told it in
LINE 70: confidence to our maid Sarah, and Sarah told it to me."
LINE 71: "In confidence, I suppose? And you tell it in confidence to us? But _I_
LINE 72: can tell _you_ that it is but a lame story after all, and scarcely
LINE 73: one-half of it true."
LINE 74: While I spoke I completed the sealing and direction of my letters, with
LINE 75: a somewhat unsteady hand, in spite of all my efforts to retain
LINE 76: composure, and in spite of my firm conviction that the story _was_ a
LINE 77: lame one—that the supposed Mrs. Graham, most certainly, had not
LINE 78: _voluntarily_ gone back to her husband, or dreamt of a reconciliation.
LINE 79: Most likely she was gone away, and the tale-bearing servant, not
LINE 80: knowing what was become of her, had _conjectured_ that such was the
LINE 81: case, and our fair visitor had detailed it as a certainty, delighted
LINE 82: with such an opportunity of tormenting me. But it was possible—barely
LINE 83: possible—that some one might have betrayed her, and she had been taken
LINE 84: away by force. Determined to know the worst, I hastily pocketed my two
LINE 85: letters, and muttered something about being too late for the post, left
LINE 86: the room, rushed into the yard, and vociferously called for my horse.
LINE 87: No one being there, I dragged him out of the stable myself, strapped
LINE 88: the saddle on to his back and the bridle on to his head, mounted, and
LINE 89: speedily galloped away to Woodford. I found its owner pensively
LINE 90: strolling in the grounds.
LINE 91: "Is your sister gone?" were my first words as I grasped his hand,
LINE 92: instead of the usual inquiry after his health.
LINE 93: "Yes, she's gone," was his answer, so calmly spoken that my terror was
LINE 94: at once removed.
LINE 95: "I suppose I mayn't know where she is?" said I, as I dismounted, and
LINE 96: relinquished my horse to the gardener, who, being the only servant
LINE 97: within call, had been summoned by his master, from his employment of
LINE 98: raking up the dead leaves on the lawn, to take him to the stables.
LINE 99: My companion gravely took my arm, and leading me away to the garden,
LINE 100: thus answered my question,—"She is at Grassdale Manor, in ——shire."
LINE 101: "Where?" cried I, with a convulsive start.
LINE 102: "At Grassdale Manor."
LINE 103: "How was it?" I gasped. "Who betrayed her?"
LINE 104: "She went of her own accord."
LINE 105: "Impossible, Lawrence! She _could_ not be so frantic!" exclaimed I,
LINE 106: vehemently grasping his arm, as if to force him to unsay those hateful
LINE 107: words.
LINE 108: "She did," persisted he in the same grave, collected manner as before;
LINE 109: "and not without reason," he continued, gently disengaging himself from
LINE 110: my grasp. "Mr. Huntingdon is ill."
LINE 111: "And so she went to nurse him?"
LINE 112: "Yes."
LINE 113: "Fool!" I could not help exclaiming, and Lawrence looked up with a
LINE 114: rather reproachful glance. "Is he dying, then?"
LINE 115: "I think not, Markham."
LINE 116: "And how many more nurses has he? How many ladies are there besides to
LINE 117: take care of him?"
LINE 118: "None; he was alone, or she would not have gone."
LINE 119: "Oh, confound it! This is intolerable!"
LINE 120: "What is? That he should be alone?"
LINE 121: I attempted no reply, for I was not sure that this circumstance did not
LINE 122: partly conduce to my distraction. I therefore continued to pace the
LINE 123: walk in silent anguish, with my hand pressed to my forehead; then
LINE 124: suddenly pausing and turning to my companion, I impatiently exclaimed,
LINE 125: "Why did she take this infatuated step? What fiend persuaded her to
LINE 126: it?"
LINE 127: "Nothing persuaded her but her own sense of duty."
LINE 128: "Humbug!"
LINE 129: "I was half inclined to say so myself, Markham, at first. I assure you
LINE 130: it was not by my advice that she went, for I detest that man as
LINE 131: fervently as you can do,—except, indeed, that his reformation would
LINE 132: give me much greater pleasure than his death; but all I did was to
LINE 133: inform her of the circumstance of his illness (the consequence of a
LINE 134: fall from his horse in hunting), and to tell her that that unhappy
LINE 135: person, Miss Myers, had left him some time ago."
LINE 136: "It was ill done! Now, when he finds the convenience of her presence,
LINE 137: he will make all manner of lying speeches and false, fair promises for
LINE 138: the future, and she will believe him, and then her condition will be
LINE 139: ten times worse and ten times more irremediable than before."
LINE 140: "There does not appear to be much ground for such apprehensions at
LINE 141: present," said he, producing a letter from his pocket. "From the
LINE 142: account I received this morning, I should say—"
LINE 143: It was _her_ writing! By an irresistible impulse I held out my hand,
LINE 144: and the words, "Let me see it," involuntarily passed my lips. He was
LINE 145: evidently reluctant to grant the request, but while he hesitated I
LINE 146: snatched it from his hand. Recollecting myself, however, the minute
LINE 147: after, I offered to restore it.
LINE 148: "Here, take it," said I, "if you don't want me to read it."
LINE 149: "No," replied he, "you may read it if you like."
LINE 150: I read it, and so may you.
LINE 151: Grassdale, Nov. 4th.
LINE 152: DEAR FREDERICK,—I know you will be anxious to hear from me, and I will
LINE 153: tell you all I can. Mr. Huntingdon is very ill, but not dying, or in
LINE 154: any immediate danger; and he is rather better at present than he was
LINE 155: when I came. I found the house in sad confusion: Mrs. Greaves, Benson,
LINE 156: every decent servant had left, and those that were come to supply their
LINE 157: places were a negligent, disorderly set, to say no worse—I must change
LINE 158: them again, if I stay. A professional nurse, a grim, hard old woman,
LINE 159: had been hired to attend the wretched invalid. He suffers much, and has
LINE 160: no fortitude to bear him through. The immediate injuries he sustained
LINE 161: from the accident, however, were not very severe, and would, as the
LINE 162: doctor says, have been but trifling to a man of temperate habits, but
LINE 163: with _him_ it is very different. On the night of my arrival, when I
LINE 164: first entered his room, he was lying in a kind of half delirium. He did
LINE 165: not notice me till I spoke, and then he mistook me for another.
LINE 166: "Is it you, Alice, come again?" he murmured. "What did you leave me
LINE 167: for?"
LINE 168: "It is I, Arthur—it is Helen, your wife," I replied.
LINE 169: "My wife!" said he, with a start. "For heaven's sake, don't mention
LINE 170: her—I have none. Devil take her," he cried, a moment after, "and you,
LINE 171: too! What did you do it for?"
LINE 172: I said no more; but observing that he kept gazing towards the foot of
LINE 173: the bed, I went and sat there, placing the light so as to shine full
LINE 174: upon me, for I thought he might be dying, and I wanted him to know me.
LINE 175: For a long time he lay silently looking upon me, first with a vacant
LINE 176: stare, then with a fixed gaze of strange growing intensity. At last he
LINE 177: startled me by suddenly raising himself on his elbow and demanding in a
LINE 178: horrified whisper, with his eyes still fixed upon me, "Who is it?"
LINE 179: "It is Helen Huntingdon," said I, quietly rising at the same time, and
LINE 180: removing to a less conspicuous position.
LINE 181: "I must be going mad," cried he, "or something—delirious, perhaps; but
LINE 182: leave me, whoever you are. I can't bear that white face, and those
LINE 183: eyes. For God's sake go, and send me somebody else that doesn't look
LINE 184: like that!"
LINE 185: I went at once, and sent the hired nurse; but next morning I ventured
LINE 186: to enter his chamber again, and, taking the nurse's place by his
LINE 187: bedside, I watched him and waited on him for several hours, showing
LINE 188: myself as little as possible, and only speaking when necessary, and
LINE 189: then not above my breath. At first he addressed me as the nurse, but,
LINE 190: on my crossing the room to draw up the window-blinds, in obedience to
LINE 191: his directions, he said, "No, it isn't nurse; it's Alice. Stay with me,
LINE 192: do! That old hag will be the death of me."
LINE 193: "I mean to stay with you," said I. And after that he would call me
LINE 194: Alice, or some other name almost equally repugnant to my feelings. I
LINE 195: forced myself to endure it for a while, fearing a contradiction might
LINE 196: disturb him too much; but when, having asked for a glass of water,
LINE 197: while I held it to his lips, he murmured, "Thanks, dearest!" I could
LINE 198: not help distinctly observing, "You would not say so if you knew me,"
LINE 199: intending to follow that up with another declaration of my identity;
LINE 200: but he merely muttered an incoherent reply, so I dropped it again, till
LINE 201: some time after, when, as I was bathing his forehead and temples with
LINE 202: vinegar and water to relieve the heat and pain in his head, he
LINE 203: observed, after looking earnestly upon me for some minutes, "I have
LINE 204: such strange fancies—I can't get rid of them, and they won't let me
LINE 205: rest; and the most singular and pertinacious of them all is your face
LINE 206: and voice—they seem just like hers. I could swear at this moment that
LINE 207: she was by my side."
LINE 208: "She is," said I.
LINE 209: "That seems comfortable," continued he, without noticing my words; "and
LINE 210: while you do it, the other fancies fade away—but _this_ only
LINE 211: strengthens.—Go on—go on, till it vanishes, too. I can't stand such a
LINE 212: mania as this; it would kill me!"
LINE 213: "It never will vanish," said I, distinctly, "for it is the truth!"
LINE 214: "The truth!" he cried, starting, as if an asp had stung him. "You don't
LINE 215: mean to say that you are really she?"
LINE 216: "I do; but you needn't shrink away from me, as if I were your greatest
LINE 217: enemy: I am come to take care of you, and do what none of _them_ would
LINE 218: do."
LINE 219: "For God's sake, don't torment me now!" cried he in pitiable agitation;
LINE 220: and then he began to mutter bitter curses against me, or the evil
LINE 221: fortune that had brought me there; while I put down the sponge and
LINE 222: basin, and resumed my seat at the bed-side.
LINE 223: "Where are they?" said he: "have they all left me—servants and all?"
LINE 224: "There are servants within call if you want them; but you had better
LINE 225: lie down now and be quiet: none of them could or would attend you as
LINE 226: carefully as I shall do."
LINE 227: "I can't understand it at all," said he, in bewildered perplexity. "Was
LINE 228: it a dream that—" and he covered his eyes with his hands, as if trying
LINE 229: to unravel the mystery.
LINE 230: "No, Arthur, it was not a dream, that your conduct was such as to
LINE 231: oblige me to leave you; but I heard that you were ill and alone, and I
LINE 232: am come back to nurse you. You need not fear to trust me: tell me all
LINE 233: your wants, and I will try to satisfy them. There is no one else to
LINE 234: care for you; and I shall not upbraid you now."
LINE 235: "Oh! I see," said he, with a bitter smile; "it's an act of Christian
LINE 236: charity, whereby you hope to gain a higher seat in heaven for yourself,
LINE 237: and scoop a deeper pit in hell for me."
LINE 238: "No; I came to offer you that comfort and assistance your situation
LINE 239: required; and if I could benefit your soul as well as your body, and
LINE 240: awaken some sense of contrition and—"
LINE 241: "Oh, yes; if you could overwhelm me with remorse and confusion of face,
LINE 242: now's the time. What have you done with my son?"
LINE 243: "He is well, and you may see him some time, if you will compose
LINE 244: yourself, but not now."
LINE 245: "Where is he?"
LINE 246: "He is safe."
LINE 247: "Is he here?"
LINE 248: "Wherever he is, you will not see him till you have promised to leave
LINE 249: him entirely under my care and protection, and to let me take him away
LINE 250: whenever and wherever I please, if I should hereafter judge it
LINE 251: necessary to remove him again. But we will talk of that to-morrow: you
LINE 252: must be quiet now."
LINE 253: "No, let me see him now, I promise, if it _must_ be so."
LINE 254: "No—"
LINE 255: "I swear it, as God is in Heaven! Now, then, let me see him."
LINE 256: "But I cannot trust your oaths and promises: I must have a written
LINE 257: agreement, and you must sign it in presence of a witness: but not
LINE 258: to-day—to-morrow."
LINE 259: "No, to-day; now," persisted he: and he was in such a state of feverish
LINE 260: excitement, and so bent upon the immediate gratification of his wish,
LINE 261: that I thought it better to grant it at once, as I saw he would not
LINE 262: rest till I did. But I was determined my son's interest should not be
LINE 263: forgotten; and having clearly written out the promise I wished Mr.
LINE 264: Huntingdon to give upon a slip of paper, I deliberately read it over to
LINE 265: him, and made him sign it in the presence of Rachel. He begged I would
LINE 266: not insist upon this: it was a useless exposure of my want of faith in
LINE 267: his word to the servant. I told him I was sorry, but since he had
LINE 268: forfeited my confidence, he must take the consequence. He next pleaded
LINE 269: inability to hold the pen. "Then we must wait until you can hold it,"
LINE 270: said I. Upon which he said he would try; but then he could not see to
LINE 271: write. I placed my finger where the signature was to be, and told him
LINE 272: he might write his name in the dark, if he only knew where to put it.
LINE 273: But he had not power to form the letters. "In that case, you must be
LINE 274: too ill to see the child," said I; and finding me inexorable, he at
LINE 275: length managed to ratify the agreement; and I bade Rachel send the boy.
LINE 276: All this may strike you as harsh, but I felt I must not lose my present
LINE 277: advantage, and my son's future welfare should not be sacrificed to any
LINE 278: mistaken tenderness for this man's feelings. Little Arthur had not
LINE 279: forgotten his father, but thirteen months of absence, during which he
LINE 280: had seldom been permitted to hear a word about him, or hardly to
LINE 281: whisper his name, had rendered him somewhat shy; and when he was
LINE 282: ushered into the darkened room where the sick man lay, so altered from
LINE 283: his former self, with fiercely flushed face and wildly-gleaming eyes—he
LINE 284: instinctively clung to me, and stood looking on his father with a
LINE 285: countenance expressive of far more awe than pleasure.
LINE 286: "Come here, Arthur," said the latter, extending his hand towards him.
LINE 287: The child went, and timidly touched that burning hand, but almost
LINE 288: started in alarm, when his father suddenly clutched his arm and drew
LINE 289: him nearer to his side.
LINE 290: "Do you know me?" asked Mr. Huntingdon, intently perusing his features.
LINE 291: "Yes."
LINE 292: "Who am I?"
LINE 293: "Papa."
LINE 294: "Are you glad to see me?"
LINE 295: "Yes."
LINE 296: "You're _not!_" replied the disappointed parent, relaxing his hold, and
LINE 297: darting a vindictive glance at me.
LINE 298: Arthur, thus released, crept back to me and put his hand in mine. His
LINE 299: father swore I had made the child hate him, and abused and cursed me
LINE 300: bitterly. The instant he began I sent our son out of the room; and when
LINE 301: he paused to breathe, I calmly assured him that he was entirely
LINE 302: mistaken; I had never once attempted to prejudice his child against
LINE 303: him.
LINE 304: "I did indeed desire him to _forget_ you," I said, "and especially to
LINE 305: forget the lessons you taught him; and for that cause, and to lessen
LINE 306: the danger of discovery, I own I have generally discouraged his
LINE 307: inclination to talk about you; but no one can blame me for that, I
LINE 308: think."
LINE 309: The invalid only replied by groaning aloud, and rolling his head on a
LINE 310: pillow in a paroxysm of impatience.
LINE 311: "I am in hell, already!" cried he. "This cursed thirst is burning my
LINE 312: heart to ashes! Will _nobody_—"
LINE 313: Before he could finish the sentence I had poured out a glass of some
LINE 314: acidulated, cooling drink that was on the table, and brought it to him.
LINE 315: He drank it greedily, but muttered, as I took away the glass,—"I
LINE 316: suppose you're heaping coals of fire on my head, you think?"
LINE 317: Not noticing this speech, I asked if there was anything else I could do
LINE 318: for him.
LINE 319: "Yes; I'll give you another opportunity of showing your Christian
LINE 320: magnanimity," sneered he: "set my pillow straight, and these confounded
LINE 321: bed-clothes." I did so. "There: now get me another glass of that slop."
LINE 322: I complied. "This is delightful, isn't it?" said he with a malicious
LINE 323: grin, as I held it to his lips; "you never hoped for such a glorious
LINE 324: opportunity?"
LINE 325: "Now, shall I stay with you?" said I, as I replaced the glass on the
LINE 326: table: "or will you be more quiet if I go and send the nurse?"
LINE 327: "Oh, yes, you're wondrous gentle and obliging! But you've driven me mad
LINE 328: with it all!" responded he, with an impatient toss.
LINE 329: "I'll leave you, then," said I; and I withdrew, and did not trouble him
LINE 330: with my presence again that day, except for a minute or two at a time,
LINE 331: just to see how he was and what he wanted.
LINE 332: Next morning the doctor ordered him to be bled; and after that he was
LINE 333: more subdued and tranquil. I passed half the day in his room at
LINE 334: different intervals. My presence did not appear to agitate or irritate
LINE 335: him as before, and he accepted my services quietly, without any bitter
LINE 336: remarks: indeed, he scarcely spoke at all, except to make known his
LINE 337: wants, and hardly then. But on the morrow, that is to say, in
LINE 338: proportion as he recovered from the state of exhaustion and
LINE 339: stupefaction, his ill-nature appeared to revive.
LINE 340: "Oh, this sweet revenge!" cried he, when I had been doing all I could
LINE 341: to make him comfortable and to remedy the carelessness of his nurse.
LINE 342: "And you can enjoy it with such a quiet conscience too, because it's
LINE 343: all in the way of duty."
LINE 344: "It is well for me that I _am_ doing my duty," said I, with a
LINE 345: bitterness I could not repress, "for it is the only comfort I have; and
LINE 346: the satisfaction of my own conscience, it seems, is the only reward I
LINE 347: need look for!"
LINE 348: He looked rather surprised at the earnestness of my manner.
LINE 349: "What reward _did_ you look for?" he asked.
LINE 350: "You will think me a liar if I tell you; but I _did_ hope to benefit
LINE 351: you: as well to better your mind as to alleviate your present
LINE 352: sufferings; but it appears I am to do neither; your own bad spirit will
LINE 353: not let me. As far as _you_ are concerned, I have sacrificed my own
LINE 354: feelings, and all the little earthly comfort that was left me, to no
LINE 355: purpose; and every little thing I do for you is ascribed to
LINE 356: self-righteous malice and refined revenge!"
LINE 357: "It's all very fine, I daresay," said he, eyeing me with stupid
LINE 358: amazement; "and of course I ought to be melted to tears of penitence
LINE 359: and admiration at the sight of so much generosity and superhuman
LINE 360: goodness; but you see I can't manage it. However, pray do me all the
LINE 361: good you can, if you do really find any pleasure in it; for you
LINE 362: perceive I am almost as miserable just now as you need wish to see me.
LINE 363: Since you came, I confess, I have had better attendance than before,
LINE 364: for these wretches neglected me shamefully, and all my old friends seem
LINE 365: to have fairly forsaken me. I've had a dreadful time of it, I assure
LINE 366: you: I sometimes thought I should have died: do you think there's any
LINE 367: chance?"
LINE 368: "There's always a chance of death; and it is always well to live with
LINE 369: such a chance in view."
LINE 370: "Yes, yes! but do you think there's any likelihood that this illness
LINE 371: will have a fatal termination?"
LINE 372: "I cannot tell; but, supposing it should, how are you prepared to meet
LINE 373: the event?"
LINE 374: "Why, the doctor told me I wasn't to think about it, for I was sure to
LINE 375: get better if I stuck to his regimen and prescriptions."
LINE 376: "I hope you may, Arthur; but neither the doctor nor I can speak with
LINE 377: certainty in such a case; there is internal injury, and it is difficult
LINE 378: to know to what extent."
LINE 379: "There now! you want to scare me to death."
LINE 380: "No; but I don't want to lull you to false security. If a consciousness
LINE 381: of the uncertainty of life can dispose you to serious and useful
LINE 382: thoughts, I would not deprive you of the benefit of such reflections,
LINE 383: whether you do eventually recover or not. Does the idea of death appal
LINE 384: you very much?"
LINE 385: "It's just the only thing I can't bear to think of; so if you've any—"
LINE 386: "But it must come some time," interrupted I, "and if it be years hence,
LINE 387: it will as certainly overtake you as if it came to-day,—and no doubt be
LINE 388: as unwelcome then as now, unless you—"
LINE 389: "Oh, hang it! don't torment me with your preachments now, unless you
LINE 390: want to kill me outright. I can't stand it, I tell you. I've sufferings
LINE 391: enough without that. If you think there's danger, save me from it; and
LINE 392: then, in gratitude, I'll hear whatever you like to say."
LINE 393: I accordingly dropped the unwelcome topic. And now, Frederick, I think
LINE 394: I may bring my letter to a close. From these details you may form your
LINE 395: own judgment of the state of my patient, and of my own position and
LINE 396: future prospects. Let me hear from you soon, and I will write again to
LINE 397: tell you how we get on; but now that my presence is tolerated, and even
LINE 398: required, in the sick-room, I shall have but little time to spare
LINE 399: between my husband and my son,—for I must not entirely neglect the
LINE 400: latter: it would not do to keep him always with Rachel, and I dare not
LINE 401: leave him for a moment with any of the other servants, or suffer him to
LINE 402: be alone, lest he should meet them. If his father get worse, I shall
LINE 403: ask Esther Hargrave to take charge of him for a time, till I have
LINE 404: reorganised the household at least; but I greatly prefer keeping him
LINE 405: under my own eye.
LINE 406: I find myself in rather a singular position: I am exerting my utmost
LINE 407: endeavours to promote the recovery and reformation of my husband, and
LINE 408: if I succeed, what shall I do? My duty, of course,—but how? No matter;
LINE 409: I can perform the task that is before me now, and God will give me
LINE 410: strength to do whatever He requires hereafter. Good-by, dear Frederick.
LINE 411: HELEN HUNTINGDON.
LINE 412: "What do you think of it?" said Lawrence, as I silently refolded the
LINE 413: letter.
LINE 414: "It seems to me," returned I, "that she is casting her pearls before
LINE 415: swine. May they be satisfied with trampling them under their feet, and
LINE 416: not turn again and rend her! But I shall say no more against her: I see
LINE 417: that she was actuated by the best and noblest motives in what she has
LINE 418: done; and if the act is not a wise one, may heaven protect her from its
LINE 419: consequences! May I keep this letter, Lawrence?—you see she has never
LINE 420: once mentioned me throughout—or made the most distant allusion to me;
LINE 421: therefore, there can be no impropriety or harm in it."
LINE 422: "And, therefore, why should you wish to keep it?"
LINE 423: "Were not these characters written by her hand? and were not these
LINE 424: words conceived in her mind, and many of them spoken by her lips?"
LINE 425: "Well," said he. And so I kept it; otherwise, Halford, you could never
LINE 426: have become so thoroughly acquainted with its contents.
LINE 427: "And when you write," said I, "will you have the goodness to ask her if
LINE 428: I may be permitted to enlighten my mother and sister on her real
LINE 429: history and circumstance, just so far as is necessary to make the
LINE 430: neighbourhood sensible of the shameful injustice they have done her? I
LINE 431: want no tender messages, but just ask her that, and tell her it is the
LINE 432: greatest favour she could do me; and tell her—no, nothing more. You see
LINE 433: I know the address, and I might write to her myself, but I am so
LINE 434: virtuous as to refrain."
LINE 435: "Well, I'll do this for you, Markham."
LINE 436: "And as soon as you receive an answer, you'll let me know?"
LINE 437: "If all be well, I'll come myself and tell you immediately."
