LINE 1: During the next four months I did not enter Mrs. Graham's house, nor
LINE 2: she mine; but still the ladies continued to talk about her, and still
LINE 3: our acquaintance continued, though slowly, to advance. As for their
LINE 4: talk, I paid but little attention to that (when it related to the fair
LINE 5: hermit, I mean), and the only information I derived from it was, that
LINE 6: one fine frosty day she had ventured to take her little boy as far as
LINE 7: the vicarage, and that, unfortunately, nobody was at home but Miss
LINE 8: Millward; nevertheless, she had sat a long time, and, by all accounts,
LINE 9: they had found a good deal to say to each other, and parted with a
LINE 10: mutual desire to meet again. But Mary liked children, and fond mammas
LINE 11: like those who can duly appreciate their treasures.
LINE 12: But sometimes I saw her myself, not only when she came to church, but
LINE 13: when she was out on the hills with her son, whether taking a long,
LINE 14: purpose-like walk, or—on special fine days—leisurely rambling over the
LINE 15: moor or the bleak pasture-lands, surrounding the old hall, herself with
LINE 16: a book in her hand, her son gambolling about her; and, on any of these
LINE 17: occasions, when I caught sight of her in my solitary walks or rides, or
LINE 18: while following my agricultural pursuits, I generally contrived to meet
LINE 19: or overtake her, for I rather liked to see Mrs. Graham, and to talk to
LINE 20: her, and I decidedly liked to talk to her little companion, whom, when
LINE 21: once the ice of his shyness was fairly broken, I found to be a very
LINE 22: amiable, intelligent, and entertaining little fellow; and we soon
LINE 23: became excellent friends—how much to the gratification of his mamma I
LINE 24: cannot undertake to say. I suspected at first that she was desirous of
LINE 25: throwing cold water on this growing intimacy—to quench, as it were, the
LINE 26: kindling flame of our friendship—but discovering, at length, in spite
LINE 27: of her prejudice against me, that I was perfectly harmless, and even
LINE 28: well-intentioned, and that, between myself and my dog, her son derived
LINE 29: a great deal of pleasure from the acquaintance that he would not
LINE 30: otherwise have known, she ceased to object, and even welcomed my coming
LINE 31: with a smile.
LINE 32: As for Arthur, he would shout his welcome from afar, and run to meet me
LINE 33: fifty yards from his mother's side. If I happened to be on horseback he
LINE 34: was sure to get a canter or a gallop; or, if there was one of the
LINE 35: draught horses within an available distance, he was treated to a steady
LINE 36: ride upon that, which served his turn almost as well; but his mother
LINE 37: would always follow and trudge beside him—not so much, I believe, to
LINE 38: ensure his safe conduct, as to see that I instilled no objectionable
LINE 39: notions into his infant mind, for she was ever on the watch, and never
LINE 40: would allow him to be taken out of her sight. What pleased her best of
LINE 41: all was to see him romping and racing with Sancho, while I walked by
LINE 42: her side—not, I fear, for love of my company (though I sometimes
LINE 43: deluded myself with that idea), so much as for the delight she took in
LINE 44: seeing her son thus happily engaged in the enjoyment of those active
LINE 45: sports so invigorating to his tender frame, yet so seldom exercised for
LINE 46: want of playmates suited to his years: and, perhaps, her pleasure was
LINE 47: sweetened not a little by the fact of my being with _her_ instead of
LINE 48: with _him_, and therefore incapable of doing him any injury directly or
LINE 49: indirectly, designedly or otherwise, small thanks to her for that same.
LINE 50: But sometimes, I believe, she really had some little gratification in
LINE 51: conversing with me; and one bright February morning, during twenty
LINE 52: minutes' stroll along the moor, she laid aside her usual asperity and
LINE 53: reserve, and fairly entered into conversation with me, discoursing with
LINE 54: so much eloquence and depth of thought and feeling on a subject happily
LINE 55: coinciding with my own ideas, and looking so beautiful withal, that I
LINE 56: went home enchanted; and on the way (morally) started to find myself
LINE 57: thinking that, after all, it would, perhaps, be better to spend one's
LINE 58: days with such a woman than with Eliza Millward; and then I
LINE 59: (figuratively) blushed for my inconstancy.
LINE 60: On entering the parlour I found Eliza there with Rose, and no one else.
LINE 61: The surprise was not altogether so agreeable as it ought to have been.
LINE 62: We chatted together a long time, but I found her rather frivolous, and
LINE 63: even a little insipid, compared with the more mature and earnest Mrs.
LINE 64: Graham. Alas, for human constancy!
LINE 65: "However," thought I, "I ought not to marry Eliza, since my mother so
LINE 66: strongly objects to it, and I ought not to delude the girl with the
LINE 67: idea that I intended to do so. Now, if this mood continue, I shall have
LINE 68: less difficulty in emancipating my affections from her soft yet
LINE 69: unrelenting sway; and, though Mrs. Graham might be equally
LINE 70: objectionable, I may be permitted, like the doctors, to cure a greater
LINE 71: evil by a less, for I shall not fall seriously in love with the young
LINE 72: widow, I think, nor she with me—that's certain—but if I find a little
LINE 73: pleasure in her society I may surely be allowed to seek it; and if the
LINE 74: star of her divinity be bright enough to dim the lustre of Eliza's, so
LINE 75: much the better, but I scarcely can think it."
LINE 76: And thereafter I seldom suffered a fine day to pass without paying a
LINE 77: visit to Wildfell about the time my new acquaintance usually left her
LINE 78: hermitage; but so frequently was I baulked in my expectations of
LINE 79: another interview, so changeable was she in her times of coming forth
LINE 80: and in her places of resort, so transient were the occasional glimpses
LINE 81: I was able to obtain, that I felt half inclined to think she took as
LINE 82: much pains to avoid my company as I to seek hers; but this was too
LINE 83: disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could
LINE 84: conveniently be dismissed.
LINE 85: One calm, clear afternoon, however, in March, as I was superintending
LINE 86: the rolling of the meadow-land, and the repairing of a hedge in the
LINE 87: valley, I saw Mrs. Graham down by the brook, with a sketch-book in her
LINE 88: hand, absorbed in the exercise of her favourite art, while Arthur was
LINE 89: putting on the time with constructing dams and breakwaters in the
LINE 90: shallow, stony stream. I was rather in want of amusement, and so rare
LINE 91: an opportunity was not to be neglected; so, leaving both meadow and
LINE 92: hedge, I quickly repaired to the spot, but not before Sancho, who,
LINE 93: immediately upon perceiving his young friend, scoured at full gallop
LINE 94: the intervening space, and pounced upon him with an impetuous mirth
LINE 95: that precipitated the child almost into the middle of the beck; but,
LINE 96: happily, the stones preserved him from any serious wetting, while their
LINE 97: smoothness prevented his being too much hurt to laugh at the untoward
LINE 98: event.
LINE 99: Mrs. Graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different
LINE 100: varieties of trees in their winter nakedness, and copying, with a
LINE 101: spirited, though delicate touch, their various ramifications. She did
LINE 102: not talk much, but I stood and watched the progress of her pencil: it
LINE 103: was a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by those fair and
LINE 104: graceful fingers. But ere long their dexterity became impaired, they
LINE 105: began to hesitate, to tremble slightly, and make false strokes, and
LINE 106: then suddenly came to a pause, while their owner laughingly raised her
LINE 107: face to mine, and told me that her sketch did not profit by my
LINE 108: superintendence.
LINE 109: "Then," said I, "I'll talk to Arthur till you've done."
LINE 110: "I should like to have a ride, Mr. Markham, if mamma will let me," said
LINE 111: the child.
LINE 112: "What on, my boy?"
LINE 113: "I think there's a horse in that field," replied he, pointing to where
LINE 114: the strong black mare was pulling the roller.
LINE 115: "No, no, Arthur; it's too far," objected his mother.
LINE 116: But I promised to bring him safe back after a turn or two up and down
LINE 117: the meadow; and when she looked at his eager face she smiled and let
LINE 118: him go. It was the first time she had even allowed me to take him so
LINE 119: much as half a field's length from her side.
LINE 120: [Illustration]
LINE 121: Enthroned upon his monstrous steed, and solemnly proceeding up and down
LINE 122: the wide, steep field, he looked the very incarnation of quiet, gleeful
LINE 123: satisfaction and delight. The rolling, however, was soon completed; but
LINE 124: when I dismounted the gallant horseman, and restored him to his mother,
LINE 125: she seemed rather displeased at my keeping him so long. She had shut up
LINE 126: her sketch-book, and been, probably, for some minutes impatiently
LINE 127: waiting his return.
LINE 128: It was now high time to go home, she said, and would have bid me
LINE 129: good-evening, but I was not going to leave her yet: I accompanied her
LINE 130: half-way up the hill. She became more sociable, and I was beginning to
LINE 131: be very happy; but, on coming within sight of the grim old hall, she
LINE 132: stood still, and turned towards me while she spoke, as if expecting I
LINE 133: should go no further, that the conversation would end here, and I
LINE 134: should now take leave and depart—as, indeed, it was time to do, for
LINE 135: "the clear, cold eve" was fast "declining," the sun had set, and the
LINE 136: gibbous moon was visibly brightening in the pale grey sky; but a
LINE 137: feeling almost of compassion riveted me to the spot. It seemed hard to
LINE 138: leave her to such a lonely, comfortless home. I looked up at it. Silent
LINE 139: and grim it frowned before us. A faint, red light was gleaming from the
LINE 140: lower windows of one wing, but all the other windows were in darkness,
LINE 141: and many exhibited their black, cavernous gulfs, entirely destitute of
LINE 142: glazing or framework.
LINE 143: "Do you not find it a desolate place to live in?" said I, after a
LINE 144: moment of silent contemplation.
LINE 145: "I do, sometimes," replied she. "On winter evenings, when Arthur is in
LINE 146: bed, and I am sitting there alone, hearing the bleak wind moaning round
LINE 147: me and howling through the ruinous old chambers, no books or
LINE 148: occupations can repress the dismal thoughts and apprehensions that come
LINE 149: crowding in—but it is folly to give way to such weakness, I know. If
LINE 150: Rachel is satisfied with such a life, why should not I?—Indeed, I
LINE 151: cannot be too thankful for such an asylum, while it is left me."
LINE 152: The closing sentence was uttered in an under-tone, as if spoken rather
LINE 153: to herself than to me. She then bid me good-evening and withdrew.
LINE 154: I had not proceeded many steps on my way homewards when I perceived Mr.
LINE 155: Lawrence, on his pretty grey pony, coming up the rugged lane that
LINE 156: crossed over the hill-top. I went a little out of my way to speak to
LINE 157: him; for we had not met for some time.
LINE 158: "Was that Mrs. Graham you were speaking to just now?" said he, after
LINE 159: the first few words of greeting had passed between us.
LINE 160: "Yes."
LINE 161: "Humph! I thought so." He looked contemplatively at his horse's mane,
LINE 162: as if he had some serious cause of dissatisfaction with it, or
LINE 163: something else.
LINE 164: "Well! what then?"
LINE 165: "Oh, nothing!" replied he. "Only I thought you disliked her," he
LINE 166: quietly added, curling his classic lip with a slightly sarcastic smile.
LINE 167: "Suppose I did; mayn't a man change his mind on further acquaintance?"
LINE 168: "Yes, of course," returned he, nicely reducing an entanglement in the
LINE 169: pony's redundant hoary mane. Then suddenly turning to me, and fixing
LINE 170: his shy, hazel eyes upon me with a steady penetrating gaze, he added,
LINE 171: "Then you _have_ changed your mind?"
LINE 172: "I can't say that I have exactly. No; I think I hold the same opinion
LINE 173: respecting her as before—but slightly ameliorated."
LINE 174: "Oh!" He looked round for something else to talk about; and glancing up
LINE 175: at the moon, made some remark upon the beauty of the evening, which I
LINE 176: did not answer, as being irrelevant to the subject.
LINE 177: "Lawrence," said I, calmly looking him in the face, "are you in love
LINE 178: with Mrs. Graham?"
LINE 179: Instead of his being deeply offended at this, as I more than half
LINE 180: expected he would, the first start of surprise, at the audacious
LINE 181: question, was followed by a tittering laugh, as if he was highly amused
LINE 182: at the idea.
LINE 183: "_I_ in love with her!" repeated he. "What makes you dream of such a
LINE 184: thing?"
LINE 185: "From the interest you take in the progress of my acquaintance with the
LINE 186: lady, and the changes of my opinion concerning her, I thought you might
LINE 187: be jealous."
LINE 188: He laughed again. "Jealous! no. But I thought you were going to marry
LINE 189: Eliza Millward."
LINE 190: "You thought wrong, then; I am not going to marry either one or the
LINE 191: other—that I know of—"
LINE 192: "Then I think you'd better let them alone."
LINE 193: "Are you going to marry Jane Wilson?"
LINE 194: He coloured, and played with the mane again, but answered—"No, I think
LINE 195: not."
LINE 196: "Then you had better let her alone."
LINE 197: "She won't let me alone," he might have said; but he only looked silly
LINE 198: and said nothing for the space of half a minute, and then made another
LINE 199: attempt to turn the conversation; and this time I let it pass; for he
LINE 200: had borne enough: another word on the subject would have been like the
LINE 201: last atom that breaks the camel's back.
LINE 202: I was too late for tea; but my mother had kindly kept the teapot and
LINE 203: muffin warm upon the hobs, and, though she scolded me a little, readily
LINE 204: admitted my excuses; and when I complained of the flavour of the
LINE 205: overdrawn tea, she poured the remainder into the slop-basin, and bade
LINE 206: Rose put some fresh into the pot, and reboil the kettle, which offices
LINE 207: were performed with great commotion, and certain remarkable comments.
LINE 208: "Well!—if it had been me now, I should have had no tea at all—if it had
LINE 209: been Fergus, even, he would have to put up with such as there was, and
LINE 210: been told to be thankful, for it was far too good for him; but _you_—we
LINE 211: can't do too much for you. It's always so—if there's anything
LINE 212: particularly nice at table, mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from
LINE 213: it, and if I don't attend to that, she whispers, 'Don't eat so much of
LINE 214: that, Rose; Gilbert will like it for his supper.'—_I'm_ nothing at all.
LINE 215: In the parlour, it's 'Come, Rose, put away your things, and let's have
LINE 216: the room nice and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire;
LINE 217: Gilbert likes a cheerful fire.' In the kitchen—'Make that pie a large
LINE 218: one, Rose; I daresay the boys'll be hungry; and don't put so much
LINE 219: pepper in, they'll not like it, I'm sure'—or, 'Rose, don't put so many
LINE 220: spices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,'—or, 'Mind you put
LINE 221: plenty of currants in the cake, Fergus liked plenty.' If I say, 'Well,
LINE 222: Mamma, _I_ don't,' I'm told I ought not to think of myself. 'You know,
LINE 223: Rose, in all household matters, we have only two things to consider,
LINE 224: first, what's proper to be done; and, secondly, what's most agreeable
LINE 225: to the gentlemen of the house—anything will do for the ladies.'"
LINE 226: "And very good doctrine too," said my mother. "Gilbert thinks so, I'm
LINE 227: sure."
LINE 228: "Very convenient doctrine, for us, at all events," said I; "but if you
LINE 229: would really study my pleasure, mother, you must consider your own
LINE 230: comfort and convenience a little more than you do—as for Rose, I have
LINE 231: no doubt she'll take care of herself; and whenever she does make a
LINE 232: sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she'll take good
LINE 233: care to let me know the extent of it. But for _you_, I might sink into
LINE 234: the grossest condition of self-indulgence and carelessness about the
LINE 235: wants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly cared for
LINE 236: myself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied,
LINE 237: while left in total ignorance of what is done for me,—if Rose did not
LINE 238: enlighten me now and then; and I should receive all your kindness as a
LINE 239: matter of course, and never know how much I owe you."
LINE 240: "Ah! and you never _will_ know, Gilbert, till you're married. Then,
LINE 241: when you've got some trifling, self-conceited girl like Eliza Millward,
LINE 242: careless of everything but her own immediate pleasure and advantage, or
LINE 243: some misguided, obstinate woman, like Mrs. Graham, ignorant of her
LINE 244: principal duties, and clever only in what concerns her least to
LINE 245: know—then you'll find the difference."
LINE 246: "It will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to
LINE 247: exercise the good capacities and good feelings of others—was I?—but to
LINE 248: exert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall expect to find
LINE 249: more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable, than in being
LINE 250: made so by her: I would rather give than receive."
LINE 251: "Oh! that's all nonsense, my dear. It's mere boy's talk that! You'll
LINE 252: soon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so charming,
LINE 253: and _then_ comes the trial."
LINE 254: "Well, then, we must bear one another's burdens."
LINE 255: "Then you must fall each into your proper place. You'll do your
LINE 256: business, and she, if she's worthy of you, will do hers; but it's your
LINE 257: business to please yourself, and hers to please you. I'm sure your
LINE 258: poor, dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and after the
LINE 259: first six months or so were over, I should as soon have expected him to
LINE 260: fly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me. He always said I
LINE 261: was a good wife, and did my duty; and he always did his—bless him!—he
LINE 262: was steady and punctual, seldom found fault without a reason, always
LINE 263: did justice to my good dinners, and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by
LINE 264: delay—and that's as much as any woman can expect of any man."
LINE 265: Is it so, Halford? Is that the extent of _your_ domestic virtues; and
LINE 266: does your happy wife exact no more?
