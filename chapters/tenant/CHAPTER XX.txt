LINE 1: September 24th.—In the morning I rose, light and cheerful—nay,
LINE 2: intensely happy. The hovering cloud cast over me by my aunt's views,
LINE 3: and by the fear of not obtaining her consent, was lost in the bright
LINE 4: effulgence of my own hopes, and the too delightful consciousness of
LINE 5: requited love. It was a splendid morning; and I went out to enjoy it,
LINE 6: in a quiet ramble, in company with my own blissful thoughts. The dew
LINE 7: was on the grass, and ten thousand gossamers were waving in the breeze;
LINE 8: the happy red-breast was pouring out its little soul in song, and my
LINE 9: heart overflowed with silent hymns of gratitude and praise to heaven.
LINE 10: But I had not wandered far before my solitude was interrupted by the
LINE 11: only person that could have disturbed my musings, at that moment,
LINE 12: without being looked upon as an unwelcome intruder: Mr. Huntingdon came
LINE 13: suddenly upon me. So unexpected was the apparition, that I might have
LINE 14: thought it the creation of an over-excited imagination, had the sense
LINE 15: of sight alone borne witness to his presence; but immediately I felt
LINE 16: his strong arm round my waist and his warm kiss on my cheek, while his
LINE 17: keen and gleeful salutation, "My own Helen!" was ringing in my ear.
LINE 18: "Not yours yet!" said I, hastily swerving aside from this too
LINE 19: presumptuous greeting. "Remember my guardians. You will not easily
LINE 20: obtain my aunt's consent. Don't you see she is prejudiced against you?"
LINE 21: "I do, dearest; and you must tell me why, that I may best know how to
LINE 22: combat her objections. I suppose she thinks I am a prodigal," pursued
LINE 23: he, observing that I was unwilling to reply, "and concludes that I
LINE 24: shall have but little worldly goods wherewith to endow my better half?
LINE 25: If so, you must tell her that my property is mostly entailed, and I
LINE 26: cannot get rid of it. There may be a few mortgages on the rest—a few
LINE 27: trifling debts and incumbrances here and there, but nothing to speak
LINE 28: of; and though I acknowledge I am not so rich as I might be—or have
LINE 29: been—still, I think, we could manage pretty comfortably on what's left.
LINE 30: My father, you know, was something of a miser, and in his latter days
LINE 31: especially saw no pleasure in life but to amass riches; and so it is no
LINE 32: wonder that his son should make it his chief delight to spend them,
LINE 33: which was accordingly the case, until my acquaintance with you, dear
LINE 34: Helen, taught me other views and nobler aims. And the very idea of
LINE 35: having you to care for under my roof would force me to moderate my
LINE 36: expenses and live like a Christian—not to speak of all the prudence and
LINE 37: virtue you would instil into my mind by your wise counsels and sweet,
LINE 38: attractive goodness."
LINE 39: "But it is not that," said I; "it is not money my aunt thinks about.
LINE 40: She knows better than to value worldly wealth above its price."
LINE 41: "What is it, then?"
LINE 42: "She wishes me to—to marry none but a really good man."
LINE 43: "What, a man of 'decided piety'?—ahem!—Well, come, I'll manage that
LINE 44: too! It's Sunday to-day, isn't it? I'll go to church morning,
LINE 45: afternoon, and evening, and comport myself in such a godly sort that
LINE 46: she shall regard me with admiration and sisterly love, as a brand
LINE 47: plucked from the burning. I'll come home sighing like a furnace, and
LINE 48: full of the savour and unction of dear Mr. Blatant's discourse—"
LINE 49: "Mr. Leighton," said I, dryly.
LINE 50: "Is Mr. Leighton a 'sweet preacher,' Helen—a 'dear, delightful,
LINE 51: heavenly-minded man'?"
LINE 52: "He is a _good_ man, Mr. Huntingdon. I wish I could say half as much
LINE 53: for you."
LINE 54: "Oh, I forgot, you are a saint, too. I crave your pardon, dearest—but
LINE 55: don't call me Mr. Huntingdon; my name is Arthur."
LINE 56: "I'll call you nothing—for I'll have nothing at all to do with you if
LINE 57: you talk in that way any more. If you really mean to deceive my aunt as
LINE 58: you say, you are very wicked; and if not, you are very wrong to jest on
LINE 59: such a subject."
LINE 60: "I stand corrected," said he, concluding his laugh with a sorrowful
LINE 61: sigh. "Now," resumed he, after a momentary pause, "let us talk about
LINE 62: something else. And come nearer to me, Helen, and take my arm; and then
LINE 63: I'll let you alone. I can't be quiet while I see you walking there."
LINE 64: I complied; but said we must soon return to the house.
LINE 65: "No one will be down to breakfast yet, for long enough," he answered.
LINE 66: "You spoke of your guardians just now, Helen, but is not your father
LINE 67: still living?"
LINE 68: "Yes, but I always look upon my uncle and aunt as my guardians, for
LINE 69: they are so in deed, though not in name. My father has entirely given
LINE 70: me up to their care. I have never seen him since dear mamma died, when
LINE 71: I was a very little girl, and my aunt, at her request, offered to take
LINE 72: charge of me, and took me away to Staningley, where I have remained
LINE 73: ever since; and I don't think he would object to anything for me that
LINE 74: she thought proper to sanction."
LINE 75: "But would he sanction anything to which she thought proper to object?"
LINE 76: "No, I don't think he cares enough about me."
LINE 77: "He is very much to blame—but he doesn't know what an angel he has for
LINE 78: his daughter—which is all the better for me, as, if he did, he would
LINE 79: not be willing to part with such a treasure."
LINE 80: "And Mr. Huntingdon," said I, "I suppose you _know_ I am not an
LINE 81: heiress?"
LINE 82: He protested he had never given it a thought, and begged I would not
LINE 83: disturb his present enjoyment by the mention of such uninteresting
LINE 84: subjects. I was glad of this proof of disinterested affection; for
LINE 85: Annabella Wilmot is the probable heiress to all her uncle's wealth, in
LINE 86: addition to her late father's property, which she has already in
LINE 87: possession.
LINE 88: I now insisted upon retracing our steps to the house; but we walked
LINE 89: slowly, and went on talking as we proceeded. I need not repeat all we
LINE 90: said: let me rather refer to what passed between my aunt and me, after
LINE 91: breakfast, when Mr. Huntingdon called my uncle aside, no doubt to make
LINE 92: his proposals, and she beckoned me into another room, where she once
LINE 93: more commenced a solemn remonstrance, which, however, entirely failed
LINE 94: to convince me that her view of the case was preferable to my own.
LINE 95: "You judge him uncharitably, aunt, I know," said I. "His very friends
LINE 96: are not half so bad as you represent them. There is Walter Hargrave,
LINE 97: Milicent's brother, for one: he is but a little lower than the angels,
LINE 98: if half she says of him is true. She is continually talking to me about
LINE 99: him, and lauding his many virtues to the skies."
LINE 100: "You will form a very inadequate estimate of a man's character,"
LINE 101: replied she, "if you judge by what a fond sister says of him. The worst
LINE 102: of them generally know how to hide their misdeeds from their sisters'
LINE 103: eyes, and their mother's, too."
LINE 104: "And there is Lord Lowborough," continued I, "quite a decent man."
LINE 105: "Who told you so? Lord Lowborough is a _desperate_ man. He has
LINE 106: dissipated his fortune in gambling and other things, and is now seeking
LINE 107: an heiress to retrieve it. I told Miss Wilmot so; but you're all alike:
LINE 108: she haughtily answered she was very much obliged to me, but she
LINE 109: believed _she_ knew when a man was seeking her for her fortune, and
LINE 110: when for herself; she flattered herself she had had experience enough
LINE 111: in those matters to be justified in trusting to her own judgment—and as
LINE 112: for his lordship's lack of fortune, she cared nothing about that, as
LINE 113: she hoped her own would suffice for both; and as for his wildness, she
LINE 114: supposed he was no worse than others—besides, he was reformed now. Yes,
LINE 115: they can all play the hypocrite when they want to take in a fond,
LINE 116: misguided woman!"
LINE 117: "Well, I think he's about as good as she is," said I. "But when Mr.
LINE 118: Huntingdon is married, he won't have many opportunities of consorting
LINE 119: with his bachelor friends;—and the worse they are, the more I long to
LINE 120: deliver him from them."
LINE 121: "To be sure, my dear; and the worse _he_ is, I suppose, the more you
LINE 122: long to deliver him from himself."
LINE 123: "Yes, provided he is not incorrigible—that is, the more I long to
LINE 124: deliver him from his faults—to give him an opportunity of shaking off
LINE 125: the adventitious evil got from contact with others worse than himself,
LINE 126: and shining out in the unclouded light of his own genuine goodness—to
LINE 127: do my utmost to help his better self against his worse, and make him
LINE 128: what he would have been if he had not, from the beginning, had a bad,
LINE 129: selfish, miserly father, who, to gratify his own sordid passions,
LINE 130: restricted him in the most innocent enjoyments of childhood and youth,
LINE 131: and so disgusted him with every kind of restraint;—and a foolish mother
LINE 132: who indulged him to the top of his bent, deceiving her husband for him,
LINE 133: and doing her utmost to encourage those germs of folly and vice it was
LINE 134: her duty to suppress,—and then, such a set of companions as you
LINE 135: represent his friends to be—"
LINE 136: "Poor man!" said she, sarcastically, "his kind have greatly wronged
LINE 137: him!"
LINE 138: "They have!" cried I—"and they shall wrong him no more—his wife shall
LINE 139: undo what his mother did!"
LINE 140: "Well," said she, after a short pause, "I must say, Helen, I thought
LINE 141: better of your judgment than this—and your taste too. How you can love
LINE 142: such a man I cannot tell, or what pleasure you can find in his company;
LINE 143: for 'what fellowship hath light with darkness; or he that believeth
LINE 144: with an infidel?'"
LINE 145: "He is not an infidel;—and I am not light, and he is not darkness; his
LINE 146: worst and only vice is thoughtlessness."
LINE 147: "And thoughtlessness," pursued my aunt, "may lead to every crime, and
LINE 148: will but poorly excuse our errors in the sight of God. Mr. Huntingdon,
LINE 149: I suppose, is not without the common faculties of men: he is not so
LINE 150: light-headed as to be irresponsible: his Maker has endowed him with
LINE 151: reason and conscience as well as the rest of us; the Scriptures are
LINE 152: open to him as well as to others;—and 'if he hear not them, neither
LINE 153: will he hear though one rose from the dead.' And remember, Helen,"
LINE 154: continued she, solemnly, "'the wicked shall be turned into hell, and
LINE 155: they that _forget_ God!'" And suppose, even, that he should continue to
LINE 156: love you, and you him, and that you should pass through life together
LINE 157: with tolerable comfort—how will it be in the end, when you see
LINE 158: yourselves parted for ever; you, perhaps, taken into eternal bliss, and
LINE 159: he cast into the lake that burneth with unquenchable fire—there for
LINE 160: ever to—"
LINE 161: "Not for ever," I exclaimed, "'only till he has paid the uttermost
LINE 162: farthing;' for 'if any man's work abide not the fire, he shall suffer
LINE 163: loss, yet himself shall be saved, but so as by fire;' and He that 'is
LINE 164: able to subdue all things to Himself will have all men to be saved,'
LINE 165: and 'will, in the fulness of time, gather together in one all things in
LINE 166: Christ Jesus, who tasted death for every man, and in whom God will
LINE 167: reconcile all things to Himself, whether they be things in earth or
LINE 168: things in heaven.'"
LINE 169: "Oh, Helen! where did you learn all this?"
LINE 170: "In the Bible, aunt. I have searched it through, and found nearly
LINE 171: thirty passages, all tending to support the same theory."
LINE 172: "And is _that_ the use you make of your Bible? And did you find no
LINE 173: passages tending to prove the danger and the falsity of such a belief?"
LINE 174: "No: I found, indeed, some passages that, taken by themselves, might
LINE 175: seem to contradict that opinion; but they will all bear a different
LINE 176: construction to that which is commonly given, and in most the only
LINE 177: difficulty is in the word which we translate 'everlasting' or
LINE 178: 'eternal.' I don't know the Greek, but I believe it strictly means for
LINE 179: ages, and might signify either endless or long-enduring. And as for the
LINE 180: danger of the belief, I would not publish it abroad if I thought any
LINE 181: poor wretch would be likely to presume upon it to his own destruction,
LINE 182: but it is a glorious thought to cherish in one's own heart, and I would
LINE 183: not part with it for all the world can give!"
LINE 184: Here our conference ended, for it was now high time to prepare for
LINE 185: church. Every one attended the morning service, except my uncle, who
LINE 186: hardly ever goes, and Mr. Wilmot, who stayed at home with him to enjoy
LINE 187: a quiet game of cribbage. In the afternoon Miss Wilmot and Lord
LINE 188: Lowborough likewise excused themselves from attending; but Mr.
LINE 189: Huntingdon vouchsafed to accompany us again. Whether it was to
LINE 190: ingratiate himself with my aunt I cannot tell, but, if so, he certainly
LINE 191: should have behaved better. I must confess, I did not like his conduct
LINE 192: during service at all. Holding his prayer-book upside down, or open at
LINE 193: any place but the right, he did nothing but stare about him, unless he
LINE 194: happened to catch my aunt's eye or mine, and then he would drop his own
LINE 195: on his book, with a puritanical air of mock solemnity that would have
LINE 196: been ludicrous, if it had not been too provoking. Once, during the
LINE 197: sermon, after attentively regarding Mr. Leighton for a few minutes, he
LINE 198: suddenly produced his gold pencil-case and snatched up a Bible.
LINE 199: Perceiving that I observed the movement, he whispered that he was going
LINE 200: to make a note of the sermon; but instead of that, as I sat next him, I
LINE 201: could not help seeing that he was making a caricature of the preacher,
LINE 202: giving to the respectable, pious, elderly gentleman, the air and aspect
LINE 203: of a most absurd old hypocrite. And yet, upon his return, he talked to
LINE 204: my aunt about the sermon with a degree of modest, serious
LINE 205: discrimination that tempted me to believe he had really attended to and
LINE 206: profited by the discourse.
LINE 207: Just before dinner my uncle called me into the library for the
LINE 208: discussion of a very important matter, which was dismissed in few
LINE 209: words.
LINE 210: "Now, Nell," said he, "this young Huntingdon has been asking for you:
LINE 211: what must I say about it? Your aunt would answer 'no'—but what say
LINE 212: you?"
LINE 213: "I say yes, uncle," replied I, without a moment's hesitation; for I had
LINE 214: thoroughly made up my mind on the subject.
LINE 215: "Very good!" cried he. "Now that's a good honest answer—wonderful for a
LINE 216: girl!—Well, I'll write to your father to-morrow. He's sure to give his
LINE 217: consent; so you may look on the matter as settled. You'd have done a
LINE 218: deal better if you'd taken Wilmot, I can tell you; but that you won't
LINE 219: believe. At your time of life, it's love that rules the roast: at mine,
LINE 220: it's solid, serviceable gold. I suppose now, you'd never dream of
LINE 221: looking into the state of your husband's finances, or troubling your
LINE 222: head about settlements, or anything of that sort?"
LINE 223: "I don't think I should."
LINE 224: "Well, be thankful, then, that you've wiser heads to think for you. I
LINE 225: haven't had time, yet, to examine thoroughly into this young rascal's
LINE 226: affairs, but I see that a great part of his father's fine property has
LINE 227: been squandered away;—but still, I think, there's a pretty fair share
LINE 228: of it left, and a little careful nursing may make a handsome thing of
LINE 229: it yet; and then we must persuade your father to give you a decent
LINE 230: fortune, as he has only one besides yourself to care for;—and, if you
LINE 231: behave well, who knows but what I may be induced to remember you in my
LINE 232: will!" continued he, putting his fingers to his nose, with a knowing
LINE 233: wink.
LINE 234: "Thanks, uncle, for that and all your kindness," replied I.
LINE 235: "Well, and I questioned this young spark on the matter of settlements,"
LINE 236: continued he; "and he seemed disposed to be generous enough on that
LINE 237: point—"
LINE 238: "I knew he would!" said I. "But pray don't trouble your head—or his, or
LINE 239: mine about that; for all I have will be his, and all he has will be
LINE 240: mine; and what more could either of us require?" And I was about to
LINE 241: make my exit, but he called me back.
LINE 242: "Stop, stop!" cried he; "we haven't mentioned the time yet. When must
LINE 243: it be? Your aunt would put it off till the Lord knows when, but he is
LINE 244: anxious to be bound as soon as may be: he won't hear of waiting beyond
LINE 245: next month; and you, I guess, will be of the same mind, so—"
LINE 246: "Not at all, uncle; on the contrary, I should like to wait till after
LINE 247: Christmas, at least."
LINE 248: "Oh! pooh, pooh! never tell me that tale—I know better," cried he; and
LINE 249: he persisted in his incredulity. Nevertheless, it is quite true. I am
LINE 250: in no hurry at all. How can I be, when I think of the momentous change
LINE 251: that awaits me, and of all I have to leave? It is happiness enough to
LINE 252: know that we _are_ to be united; and that he really loves me, and I may
LINE 253: love _him_ as devotedly, and think of him as often as I please.
LINE 254: However, I insisted upon consulting my aunt about the _time_ of the
LINE 255: wedding, for I determined her counsels should not be utterly
LINE 256: disregarded; and no conclusions on that particular are come to yet.
