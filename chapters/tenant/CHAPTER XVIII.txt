LINE 1: August 25th.—I am now quite settled down to my usual routine of steady
LINE 2: occupations and quiet amusements—tolerably contented and cheerful, but
LINE 3: still looking forward to spring with the hope of returning to town, not
LINE 4: for its gaieties and dissipations, but for the chance of meeting Mr.
LINE 5: Huntingdon once again; for still he is always in my thoughts and in my
LINE 6: dreams. In all my employments, whatever I do, or see, or hear, has an
LINE 7: ultimate reference to him; whatever skill or knowledge I acquire is
LINE 8: some day to be turned to his advantage or amusement; whatever new
LINE 9: beauties in nature or art I discover are to be depicted to meet his
LINE 10: eye, or stored in my memory to be told him at some future period. This,
LINE 11: at least, is the hope that I cherish, the fancy that lights me on my
LINE 12: lonely way. It may be only an ignis fatuus, after all, but it can do no
LINE 13: harm to follow it with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre, as long as it
LINE 14: does not lure me from the path I ought to keep; and I think it will
LINE 15: not, for I have thought deeply on my aunt's advice, and I see clearly,
LINE 16: now, the folly of throwing myself away on one that is unworthy of all
LINE 17: the love I have to give, and incapable of responding to the best and
LINE 18: deepest feelings of my inmost heart—_so_ clearly, that even if I should
LINE 19: see him again, and if he should remember me and love me still (which,
LINE 20: alas! is too little probable, considering how he is situated, and by
LINE 21: whom surrounded), and if he should ask me to marry him—I am determined
LINE 22: not to consent until I know for certain whether my aunt's opinion of
LINE 23: him or mine is nearest the truth; for if mine is altogether wrong, it
LINE 24: is not he that I love; it is a creature of my own imagination. But I
LINE 25: think it is not wrong—no, no—there is a secret something—an inward
LINE 26: instinct that assures me I am right. There is essential goodness in
LINE 27: him;—and what delight to unfold it! If he has wandered, what bliss to
LINE 28: recall him! If he is now exposed to the baneful influence of corrupting
LINE 29: and wicked companions, what glory to deliver him from them! Oh! if I
LINE 30: could but believe that Heaven has designed me for this!
LINE 31: * * * * *
LINE 32: To-day is the first of September; but my uncle has ordered the
LINE 33: gamekeeper to spare the partridges till the gentlemen come. "What
LINE 34: gentlemen?" I asked when I heard it. A small party he had invited to
LINE 35: shoot. His friend Mr. Wilmot was one, and my aunt's friend, Mr.
LINE 36: Boarham, another. This struck me as terrible news at the moment; but
LINE 37: all regret and apprehension vanished like a dream when I heard that Mr.
LINE 38: Huntingdon was actually to be a third! My aunt is greatly against his
LINE 39: coming, of course: she earnestly endeavoured to dissuade my uncle from
LINE 40: asking him; but he, laughing at her objections, told her it was no use
LINE 41: talking, for the mischief was already done: he had invited Huntingdon
LINE 42: and his friend Lord Lowborough before we left London, and nothing now
LINE 43: remained but to fix the day for their coming. So he is safe, and I am
LINE 44: sure of seeing him. I cannot express my joy. I find it very difficult
LINE 45: to conceal it from my aunt; but I don't wish to trouble her with my
LINE 46: feelings till I know whether I ought to indulge them or not. If I find
LINE 47: it my absolute duty to suppress them, they shall trouble no one but
LINE 48: myself; and if I can really feel myself justified in indulging this
LINE 49: attachment, I can dare anything, even the anger and grief of my best
LINE 50: friend, for its object—surely, I shall soon know. But they are not
LINE 51: coming till about the middle of the month.
LINE 52: We are to have two lady visitors also: Mr. Wilmot is to bring his niece
LINE 53: and her cousin Milicent. I suppose my aunt thinks the latter will
LINE 54: benefit me by her society, and the salutary example of her gentle
LINE 55: deportment and lowly and tractable spirit; and the former I suspect she
LINE 56: intends as a species of counter-attraction to win Mr. Huntingdon's
LINE 57: attention from me. I don't thank her for this; but I shall be glad of
LINE 58: Milicent's company: she is a sweet, good girl, and I wish I were like
LINE 59: her—_more_ like her, at least, than I am.
LINE 60: * * * * *
LINE 61: 19th.—They are come. They came the day before yesterday. The gentlemen
LINE 62: are all gone out to shoot, and the ladies are with my aunt, at work in
LINE 63: the drawing-room. I have retired to the library, for I am very unhappy,
LINE 64: and I want to be alone. Books cannot divert me; so having opened my
LINE 65: desk, I will try what may be done by detailing the cause of my
LINE 66: uneasiness. This paper will serve instead of a confidential friend into
LINE 67: whose ear I might pour forth the overflowings of my heart. It will not
LINE 68: sympathise with my distresses, but then it will not laugh at them, and,
LINE 69: if I keep it close, it cannot tell again; so it is, perhaps, the best
LINE 70: friend I could have for the purpose.
LINE 71: First, let me speak of his arrival—how I sat at my window, and watched
LINE 72: for nearly two hours, before his carriage entered the park-gates—for
LINE 73: they all came before him,—and how deeply I was disappointed at every
LINE 74: arrival, because it was not his. First came Mr. Wilmot and the ladies.
LINE 75: When Milicent had got into her room, I quitted my post a few minutes to
LINE 76: look in upon her and have a little private conversation, for she was
LINE 77: now my intimate friend, several long epistles having passed between us
LINE 78: since our parting. On returning to my window, I beheld another carriage
LINE 79: at the door. Was it his? No; it was Mr. Boarham's plain dark chariot;
LINE 80: and there stood he upon the steps, carefully superintending the
LINE 81: dislodging of his various boxes and packages. What a collection! One
LINE 82: would have thought he projected a visit of six months at least. A
LINE 83: considerable time after, came Lord Lowborough in his barouche. Is he
LINE 84: one of the profligate friends, I wonder? I should think not; for no one
LINE 85: could call _him_ a jolly companion, I'm sure,—and, besides, he appears
LINE 86: too sober and gentlemanly in his demeanour to merit such suspicions. He
LINE 87: is a tall, thin, gloomy-looking man, apparently between thirty and
LINE 88: forty, and of a somewhat sickly, careworn aspect.
LINE 89: At last, Mr. Huntingdon's light phaeton came bowling merrily up the
LINE 90: lawn. I had but a transient glimpse of him: for the moment it stopped,
LINE 91: he sprang out over the side on to the portico steps, and disappeared
LINE 92: into the house.
LINE 93: I now submitted to be dressed for dinner—a duty which Rachel had been
LINE 94: urging upon me for the last twenty minutes; and when that important
LINE 95: business was completed, I repaired to the drawing-room, where I found
LINE 96: Mr. and Miss Wilmot and Milicent Hargrave already assembled. Shortly
LINE 97: after, Lord Lowborough entered, and then Mr. Boarham, who seemed quite
LINE 98: willing to forget and forgive my former conduct, and to hope that a
LINE 99: little conciliation and steady perseverance on his part might yet
LINE 100: succeed in bringing me to reason. While I stood at the window,
LINE 101: conversing with Milicent, he came up to me, and was beginning to talk
LINE 102: in nearly his usual strain, when Mr. Huntingdon entered the room.
LINE 103: "How will he greet me, I wonder?" said my bounding heart; and, instead
LINE 104: of advancing to meet him, I turned to the window to hide or subdue my
LINE 105: emotion. But having saluted his host and hostess, and the rest of the
LINE 106: company, he came to me, ardently squeezed my hand, and murmured he was
LINE 107: glad to see me once again. At that moment dinner was announced: my aunt
LINE 108: desired him to take Miss Hargrave into the dining-room, and odious Mr.
LINE 109: Wilmot, with unspeakable grimaces, offered his arm to me; and I was
LINE 110: condemned to sit between himself and Mr. Boarham. But afterwards, when
LINE 111: we were all again assembled in the drawing-room, I was indemnified for
LINE 112: so much suffering by a few delightful minutes of conversation with Mr.
LINE 113: Huntingdon.
LINE 114: In the course of the evening, Miss Wilmot was called upon to sing and
LINE 115: play for the amusement of the company, and I to exhibit my drawings,
LINE 116: and, though he likes music, and she is an accomplished musician, I
LINE 117: think I am right in affirming, that he paid more attention to my
LINE 118: drawings than to her music.
LINE 119: So far so good;—but hearing him pronounce, sotto voce, but with
LINE 120: peculiar emphasis, concerning one of the pieces, "THIS is better than
LINE 121: all!"—I looked up, curious to see which it was, and, to my horror,
LINE 122: beheld him complacently gazing at the _back_ of the picture:—it was his
LINE 123: own face that I had sketched there and forgotten to rub out! To make
LINE 124: matters worse, in the agony of the moment, I attempted to snatch it
LINE 125: from his hand; but he prevented me, and exclaiming, "No—by George, I'll
LINE 126: keep it!" placed it against his waistcoat and buttoned his coat upon it
LINE 127: with a delighted chuckle.
LINE 128: Then, drawing a candle close to his elbow, he gathered all the drawings
LINE 129: to himself, as well what he had seen as the others, and muttering, "I
LINE 130: must look at _both_ sides now," he eagerly commenced an examination,
LINE 131: which I watched, at first, with tolerable composure, in the confidence
LINE 132: that his vanity would not be gratified by any further discoveries; for,
LINE 133: though I must plead guilty to having disfigured the backs of several
LINE 134: with abortive attempts to delineate that too fascinating physiognomy, I
LINE 135: was sure that, with that one unfortunate exception, I had carefully
LINE 136: obliterated all such witnesses of my infatuation. But the pencil
LINE 137: frequently leaves an impression upon cardboard that no amount of
LINE 138: rubbing can efface. Such, it seems, was the case with most of these;
LINE 139: and, I confess, I trembled when I saw him holding them so close to the
LINE 140: candle, and poring so intently over the seeming blanks; but still, I
LINE 141: trusted, he would not be able to make out these dim traces to his own
LINE 142: satisfaction. I was mistaken, however. Having ended his scrutiny, he
LINE 143: quietly remarked,—"I perceive the backs of young ladies' drawings, like
LINE 144: the postscripts of their letters, are the most important and
LINE 145: interesting part of the concern."
LINE 146: Then, leaning back in his chair, he reflected a few minutes in silence,
LINE 147: complacently smiling to himself, and while I was concocting some
LINE 148: cutting speech wherewith to check his gratification, he rose, and
LINE 149: passing over to where Annabella Wilmot sat vehemently coquetting with
LINE 150: Lord Lowborough, seated himself on the sofa beside her, and attached
LINE 151: himself to her for the rest of the evening.
LINE 152: "So then," thought I, "he despises me, because he knows I love him."
LINE 153: And the reflection made me so miserable I knew not what to do. Milicent
LINE 154: came and began to admire my drawings, and make remarks upon them; but I
LINE 155: could not talk to her—I could talk to no one, and, upon the
LINE 156: introduction of tea, I took advantage of the open door and the slight
LINE 157: diversion caused by its entrance to slip out—for I was sure I could not
LINE 158: take any—and take refuge in the library. My aunt sent Thomas in quest
LINE 159: of me, to ask if I were not coming to tea; but I bade him say I should
LINE 160: not take any to-night, and, happily, she was too much occupied with her
LINE 161: guests to make any further inquiries at the time.
LINE 162: As most of the company had travelled far that day, they retired early
LINE 163: to rest; and having heard them all, as I thought, go up-stairs, I
LINE 164: ventured out, to get my candlestick from the drawing-room sideboard.
LINE 165: But Mr. Huntingdon had lingered behind the rest. He was just at the
LINE 166: foot of the stairs when I opened the door, and hearing my step in the
LINE 167: hall—though I could hardly hear it myself—he instantly turned back.
LINE 168: "Helen, is that you?" said he. "Why did you run away from us?"
LINE 169: "Good-night, Mr. Huntingdon," said I, coldly, not choosing to answer
LINE 170: the question. And I turned away to enter the drawing-room.
LINE 171: "But you'll shake hands, won't you?" said he, placing himself in the
LINE 172: doorway before me. And he seized my hand and held it, much against my
LINE 173: will.
LINE 174: "Let me go, Mr. Huntingdon," said I. "I want to get a candle."
LINE 175: "The candle will keep," returned he.
LINE 176: I made a desperate effort to free my hand from his grasp.
LINE 177: "Why are you in such a hurry to leave me, Helen?" he said, with a smile
LINE 178: of the most provoking self-sufficiency. "You don't hate me, you
LINE 179: _know_."
LINE 180: "Yes, I do—at this moment."
LINE 181: "Not you. It is Annabella Wilmot you hate, not me."
LINE 182: "I have nothing to do with Annabella Wilmot," said I, burning with
LINE 183: indignation.
LINE 184: "But _I_ have, you know," returned he, with peculiar emphasis.
LINE 185: "That is nothing to me, sir," I retorted.
LINE 186: "_Is_ it nothing to you, Helen? Will you swear it? Will you?"
LINE 187: "No I won't, Mr. Huntingdon! and I _will_ go," cried I, not knowing
LINE 188: whether to laugh, or to cry, or to break out into a tempest of fury.
LINE 189: "Go, then, you vixen!" he said; but the instant he released my hand he
LINE 190: had the audacity to put his arm round my neck, and kiss me.
LINE 191: Trembling with anger and agitation, and I don't know what besides, I
LINE 192: broke away, and got my candle, and rushed up-stairs to my room. He
LINE 193: would not have done so but for that hateful picture. And there he had
LINE 194: it still in his possession, an eternal monument to his pride and my
LINE 195: humiliation.
LINE 196: It was but little sleep I got that night, and in the morning I rose
LINE 197: perplexed and troubled with the thoughts of meeting him at breakfast. I
LINE 198: knew not how it was to be done. An assumption of dignified, cold
LINE 199: indifference would hardly do, after what he knew of my devotion—to his
LINE 200: face, at least. Yet something must be done to check his presumption—I
LINE 201: would not submit to be tyrannised over by those bright, laughing eyes.
LINE 202: And, accordingly, I received his cheerful morning salutation as calmly
LINE 203: and coldly as my aunt could have wished, and defeated with brief
LINE 204: answers his one or two attempts to draw me into conversation, while I
LINE 205: comported myself with unusual cheerfulness and complaisance towards
LINE 206: every other member of the party, especially Annabella Wilmot, and even
LINE 207: her uncle and Mr. Boarham were treated with an extra amount of civility
LINE 208: on the occasion, not from any motives of coquetry, but just to show him
LINE 209: that my particular coolness and reserve arose from no general
LINE 210: ill-humour or depression of spirits.
LINE 211: He was not, however, to be repelled by such acting as this. He did not
LINE 212: talk much to me, but when he did speak it was with a degree of freedom
LINE 213: and openness, and _kindliness_ too, that plainly seemed to intimate he
LINE 214: knew his words were music to my ears; and when his looks met mine it
LINE 215: was with a smile—presumptuous, it might be—but oh! so sweet, so bright,
LINE 216: so genial, that I could not possibly retain my anger; every vestige of
LINE 217: displeasure soon melted away beneath it like morning clouds before the
LINE 218: summer sun.
LINE 219: Soon after breakfast all the gentlemen save one, with boyish eagerness,
LINE 220: set out on their expedition against the hapless partridges; my uncle
LINE 221: and Mr. Wilmot on their shooting ponies, Mr. Huntingdon and Lord
LINE 222: Lowborough on their legs: the one exception being Mr. Boarham, who, in
LINE 223: consideration of the rain that had fallen during the night, thought it
LINE 224: prudent to remain behind a little and join them in a while when the sun
LINE 225: had dried the grass. And he favoured us all with a long and minute
LINE 226: disquisition upon the evils and dangers attendant upon damp feet,
LINE 227: delivered with the most imperturbable gravity, amid the jeers and
LINE 228: laughter of Mr. Huntingdon and my uncle, who, leaving the prudent
LINE 229: sportsman to entertain the ladies with his medical discussions, sallied
LINE 230: forth with their guns, bending their steps to the stables first, to
LINE 231: have a look at the horses and let out the dogs.
LINE 232: Not desirous of sharing Mr. Boarham's company for the whole of the
LINE 233: morning, I betook myself to the library, and there brought forth my
LINE 234: easel and began to paint. The easel and the painting apparatus would
LINE 235: serve as an excuse for abandoning the drawing-room if my aunt should
LINE 236: come to complain of the desertion, and besides I wanted to finish the
LINE 237: picture. It was one I had taken great pains with, and I intended it to
LINE 238: be my masterpiece, though it was somewhat presumptuous in the design.
LINE 239: By the bright azure of the sky, and by the warm and brilliant lights
LINE 240: and deep long shadows, I had endeavoured to convey the idea of a sunny
LINE 241: morning. I had ventured to give more of the bright verdure of spring or
LINE 242: early summer to the grass and foliage than is commonly attempted in
LINE 243: painting. The scene represented was an open glade in a wood. A group of
LINE 244: dark Scotch firs was introduced in the middle distance to relieve the
LINE 245: prevailing freshness of the rest; but in the foreground was part of the
LINE 246: gnarled trunk and of the spreading boughs of a large forest-tree, whose
LINE 247: foliage was of a brilliant golden green—not golden from autumnal
LINE 248: mellowness, but from the sunshine and the very immaturity of the scarce
LINE 249: expanded leaves. Upon this bough, that stood out in bold relief against
LINE 250: the sombre firs, were seated an amorous pair of turtle doves, whose
LINE 251: soft sad-coloured plumage afforded a contrast of another nature; and
LINE 252: beneath it a young girl was kneeling on the daisy-spangled turf, with
LINE 253: head thrown back and masses of fair hair falling on her shoulders, her
LINE 254: hands clasped, lips parted, and eyes intently gazing upward in pleased
LINE 255: yet earnest contemplation of those feathered lovers—too deeply absorbed
LINE 256: in each other to notice her.
LINE 257: I had scarcely settled to my work, which, however, wanted but a few
LINE 258: touches to the finishing, when the sportsmen passed the window on their
LINE 259: return from the stables. It was partly open, and Mr. Huntingdon must
LINE 260: have seen me as he went by, for in half a minute he came back, and
LINE 261: setting his gun against the wall, threw up the sash and sprang in, and
LINE 262: set himself before my picture.
LINE 263: "Very pretty, i'faith," said he, after attentively regarding it for a
LINE 264: few seconds; "and a very fitting study for a young lady. Spring just
LINE 265: opening into summer—morning just approaching noon—girlhood just
LINE 266: ripening into womanhood, and hope just verging on fruition. She's a
LINE 267: sweet creature! but why didn't you make her black hair?"
LINE 268: "I thought light hair would suit her better. You see I have made her
LINE 269: blue-eyed and plump, and fair and rosy."
LINE 270: "Upon my word—a very Hebe! I should fall in love with her if I hadn't
LINE 271: the artist before me. Sweet innocent! she's thinking there will come a
LINE 272: time when she will be wooed and won like that pretty hen-dove by as
LINE 273: fond and fervent a lover; and she's thinking how pleasant it will be,
LINE 274: and how tender and faithful he will find her."
LINE 275: "And perhaps," suggested I, "how tender and faithful she shall find
LINE 276: him."
LINE 277: "Perhaps, for there is no limit to the wild extravagance of Hope's
LINE 278: imaginings at such an age."
LINE 279: "Do you call _that_, then, one of her wild, extravagant delusions?"
LINE 280: "No; my heart tells me it is not. I might have thought so once, but
LINE 281: now, I say, give me the girl I love, and I will swear eternal constancy
LINE 282: to her and her alone, through summer and winter, through youth and age,
LINE 283: and life and death! if age and death _must_ come."
LINE 284: He spoke this in such serious earnest that my heart bounded with
LINE 285: delight; but the minute after he changed his tone, and asked, with a
LINE 286: significant smile, if I had "any more portraits."
LINE 287: "No," replied I, reddening with confusion and wrath.
LINE 288: But my portfolio was on the table: he took it up, and coolly sat down
LINE 289: to examine its contents.
LINE 290: "Mr. Huntingdon, those are my unfinished sketches," cried I, "and I
LINE 291: never let any one see them."
LINE 292: And I placed my hand on the portfolio to wrest it from him, but he
LINE 293: maintained his hold, assuring me that he "liked unfinished sketches of
LINE 294: all things."
LINE 295: "But I hate them to be seen," returned I. "I can't let you have it,
LINE 296: indeed!"
LINE 297: "Let me have its bowels then," said he; and just as I wrenched the
LINE 298: portfolio from his hand, he deftly abstracted the greater part of its
LINE 299: contents, and after turning them over a moment he cried out,—"Bless my
LINE 300: stars, here's another;" and slipped a small oval of ivory paper into
LINE 301: his waistcoat pocket—a complete miniature portrait that I had sketched
LINE 302: with such tolerable success as to be induced to colour it with great
LINE 303: pains and care. But I was determined he should not keep it.
LINE 304: "Mr. Huntingdon," cried I, "I _insist_ upon having that back! It is
LINE 305: mine, and you have no _right_ to take it. Give it me directly—I'll
LINE 306: never forgive you if you don't!"
LINE 307: But the more vehemently I insisted, the more he aggravated my distress
LINE 308: by his insulting, gleeful laugh. At length, however, he restored it to
LINE 309: me, saying,—"Well, well, since you value it so much, I'll not deprive
LINE 310: you of it."
LINE 311: To show him how I valued it, I tore it in two and threw it into the
LINE 312: fire. He was not prepared for this. His merriment suddenly ceasing, he
LINE 313: stared in mute amazement at the consuming treasure; and then, with a
LINE 314: careless "Humph! I'll go and shoot now," he turned on his heel and
LINE 315: vacated the apartment by the window as he came, and setting on his hat
LINE 316: with an air, took up his gun and walked away, whistling as he went—and
LINE 317: leaving me not too much agitated to finish my picture, for I was glad,
LINE 318: at the moment, that I had vexed him.
LINE 319: When I returned to the drawing-room, I found Mr. Boarham had ventured
LINE 320: to follow his comrades to the field; and shortly after lunch, to which
LINE 321: they did not think of returning, I volunteered to accompany the ladies
LINE 322: in a walk, and show Annabella and Milicent the beauties of the country.
LINE 323: We took a long ramble, and re-entered the park just as the sportsmen
LINE 324: were returning from their expedition. Toil-spent and travel-stained,
LINE 325: the main body of them crossed over the grass to avoid us, but Mr.
LINE 326: Huntingdon, all spattered and splashed as he was, and stained with the
LINE 327: blood of his prey—to the no small offence of my aunt's strict sense of
LINE 328: propriety—came out of his way to meet us, with cheerful smiles and
LINE 329: words for all but me, and placing himself between Annabella Wilmot and
LINE 330: myself, walked up the road and began to relate the various exploits and
LINE 331: disasters of the day, in a manner that would have convulsed me with
LINE 332: laughter if I had been on good terms with him; but he addressed himself
LINE 333: entirely to Annabella, and I, of course, left all the laughter and all
LINE 334: the badinage to her, and affecting the utmost indifference to whatever
LINE 335: passed between them, walked along a few paces apart, and looking every
LINE 336: way but theirs, while my aunt and Milicent went before, linked arm in
LINE 337: arm and gravely discoursing together. At length Mr. Huntingdon turned
LINE 338: to me, and addressing me in a confidential whisper, said,—"Helen, why
LINE 339: did you burn my picture?"
LINE 340: "Because I wished to destroy it," I answered, with an asperity it is
LINE 341: useless now to lament.
LINE 342: "Oh, very good!" was the reply; "if _you_ don't value me, I must turn
LINE 343: to somebody that will."
LINE 344: I thought it was partly in jest—a half-playful mixture of mock
LINE 345: resignation and pretended indifference: but immediately he resumed his
LINE 346: place beside Miss Wilmot, and from that hour to this—during all that
LINE 347: evening, and all the next day, and the next, and the next, and all this
LINE 348: morning (the 22nd), he has never given me one kind word or one pleasant
LINE 349: look—never spoken to me, but from pure necessity—never glanced towards
LINE 350: me but with a cold, unfriendly look I thought him quite incapable of
LINE 351: assuming.
LINE 352: My aunt observes the change, and though she has not inquired the cause
LINE 353: or made any remark to me on the subject, I see it gives her pleasure.
LINE 354: Miss Wilmot observes it, too, and triumphantly ascribes it to her own
LINE 355: superior charms and blandishments; but I am truly miserable—more so
LINE 356: than I like to acknowledge to myself. Pride refuses to aid me. It has
LINE 357: brought me into the scrape, and will not help me out of it.
LINE 358: He meant no harm—it was only his joyous, playful spirit; and I, by my
LINE 359: acrimonious resentment—so serious, so disproportioned to the
LINE 360: offence—have so wounded his feelings, so deeply offended him, that I
LINE 361: fear he will never forgive me—and all for a mere jest! He thinks I
LINE 362: dislike him, and he must continue to think so. I must lose him for
LINE 363: ever, and Annabella may win him, and triumph as she will.
LINE 364: But it is not my loss nor her triumph that I deplore so greatly as the
LINE 365: wreck of my fond hopes for his advantage, and her unworthiness of his
LINE 366: affection, and the injury he will do himself by trusting his happiness
LINE 367: to her. _She_ does not love him: she thinks only of herself. She cannot
LINE 368: appreciate the good that is in him: she will neither see it, nor value
LINE 369: it, nor cherish it. She will neither deplore his faults nor attempt
LINE 370: their amendment, but rather aggravate them by her own. And I doubt
LINE 371: whether she will not deceive him after all. I see she is playing double
LINE 372: between him and Lord Lowborough, and while she amuses herself with the
LINE 373: lively Huntingdon, she tries her utmost to enslave his moody friend;
LINE 374: and should she succeed in bringing both to her feet, the fascinating
LINE 375: commoner will have but little chance against the lordly peer. If he
LINE 376: observes her artful by-play, it gives him no uneasiness, but rather
LINE 377: adds new zest to his diversion by opposing a stimulating check to his
LINE 378: otherwise too easy conquest.
LINE 379: Messrs. Wilmot and Boarham have severally taken occasion by his neglect
LINE 380: of me to renew their advances; and if I were like Annabella and some
LINE 381: others I should take advantage of their perseverance to endeavour to
LINE 382: pique him into a revival of affection; but, justice and honesty apart,
LINE 383: I could not _bear_ to do it. I am annoyed enough by their present
LINE 384: persecutions without encouraging them further; and even if I did it
LINE 385: would have precious little effect upon him. He sees me suffering under
LINE 386: the condescending attentions and prosaic discourses of the one, and the
LINE 387: repulsive obtrusions of the other, without so much as a shadow of
LINE 388: commiseration for me, or resentment against my tormentors. He never
LINE 389: could have loved me, or he would not have resigned me so willingly, and
LINE 390: he would not go on talking to everybody else so cheerfully as he
LINE 391: does—laughing and jesting with Lord Lowborough and my uncle, teasing
LINE 392: Milicent Hargrave, and flirting with Annabella Wilmot—as if nothing
LINE 393: were on his mind. Oh! why can't I hate him? I must be infatuated, or I
LINE 394: should scorn to regret him as I do. But I must rally all the powers I
LINE 395: have remaining, and try to tear him from my heart. There goes the
LINE 396: dinner-bell, and here comes my aunt to scold me for sitting here at my
LINE 397: desk all day, instead of staying with the company: wish the company
LINE 398: were—gone.
