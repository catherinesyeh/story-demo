LINE 1: October 10th.—Mr. Huntingdon returned about three weeks ago. His
LINE 2: appearance, his demeanour and conversation, and my feelings with regard
LINE 3: to him, I shall not trouble myself to describe. The day after his
LINE 4: arrival, however, he surprised me by the announcement of an intention
LINE 5: to procure a governess for little Arthur: I told him it was quite
LINE 6: unnecessary, not to say ridiculous, at the present season: I thought I
LINE 7: was fully competent to the task of teaching him myself—for some years
LINE 8: to come, at least: the child's education was the only pleasure and
LINE 9: business of my life; and since he had deprived me of every other
LINE 10: occupation, he might surely leave me that.
LINE 11: He said I was not fit to teach children, or to be with them: I had
LINE 12: already reduced the boy to little better than an automaton; I had
LINE 13: broken his fine spirit with my rigid severity; and I should freeze all
LINE 14: the sunshine out of his heart, and make him as gloomy an ascetic as
LINE 15: myself, if I had the handling of him much longer. And poor Rachel, too,
LINE 16: came in for her share of abuse, as usual; he cannot endure Rachel,
LINE 17: because he knows she has a proper appreciation of him.
LINE 18: I calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess,
LINE 19: and still resisted the proposed addition to our family; but he cut me
LINE 20: short by saying it was no use bothering about the matter, for he had
LINE 21: engaged a governess already, and she was coming next week; so that all
LINE 22: I had to do was to get things ready for her reception. This was a
LINE 23: rather startling piece of intelligence. I ventured to inquire her name
LINE 24: and address, by whom she had been recommended, or how he had been led
LINE 25: to make choice of her.
LINE 26: "She is a very estimable, pious young person," said he; "you needn't be
LINE 27: afraid. Her name is Myers, I believe; and she was recommended to me by
LINE 28: a respectable old dowager: a lady of high repute in the religious
LINE 29: world. I have not seen her myself, and therefore cannot give you a
LINE 30: particular account of her person and conversation, and so forth; but,
LINE 31: if the old lady's eulogies are correct, you will find her to possess
LINE 32: all desirable qualifications for her position: an inordinate love of
LINE 33: children among the rest."
LINE 34: All this was gravely and quietly spoken, but there was a laughing demon
LINE 35: in his half-averted eye that boded no good, I imagined. However, I
LINE 36: thought of my asylum in ——shire, and made no further objections.
LINE 37: When Miss Myers arrived, I was not prepared to give her a very cordial
LINE 38: reception. Her appearance was not particularly calculated to produce a
LINE 39: favourable impression at first sight, nor did her manners and
LINE 40: subsequent conduct, in any degree, remove the prejudice I had already
LINE 41: conceived against her. Her attainments were limited, her intellect
LINE 42: noways above mediocrity. She had a fine voice, and could sing like a
LINE 43: nightingale, and accompany herself sufficiently well on the piano; but
LINE 44: these were her only accomplishments. There was a look of guile and
LINE 45: subtlety in her face, a sound of it in her voice. She seemed afraid of
LINE 46: me, and would start if I suddenly approached her. In her behaviour she
LINE 47: was respectful and complaisant, even to servility: she attempted to
LINE 48: flatter and fawn upon me at first, but I soon checked that. Her
LINE 49: fondness for her little pupil was overstrained, and I was obliged to
LINE 50: remonstrate with her on the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious
LINE 51: praise; but she could not gain his heart. Her piety consisted in an
LINE 52: occasional heaving of sighs, and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling, and
LINE 53: the utterance of a few cant phrases. She told me she was a clergyman's
LINE 54: daughter, and had been left an orphan from her childhood, but had had
LINE 55: the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family; and then
LINE 56: she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its
LINE 57: different members, that I reproached myself for my uncharitable
LINE 58: thoughts and unfriendly conduct, and relented for a time, but not for
LINE 59: long: my causes of dislike were too rational, my suspicions too well
LINE 60: founded for that; and I knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize
LINE 61: till those suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed.
LINE 62: I asked the name and residence of the kind and pious family. She
LINE 63: mentioned a common name, and an unknown and distant place of abode, but
LINE 64: told me they were now on the Continent, and their present address was
LINE 65: unknown to her. I never saw her speak much to Mr. Huntingdon; but he
LINE 66: would frequently look into the school-room to see how little Arthur got
LINE 67: on with his new companion, when I was not there. In the evening, she
LINE 68: sat with us in the drawing-room, and would sing and play to amuse him
LINE 69: or us, as she pretended, and was very attentive to his wants, and
LINE 70: watchful to anticipate them, though she only talked to me; indeed, he
LINE 71: was seldom in a condition to be talked to. Had she been other than she
LINE 72: was, I should have felt her presence a great relief to come between us
LINE 73: thus, except, indeed, that I should have been thoroughly ashamed for
LINE 74: any decent person to see him as he often was.
LINE 75: I did not mention my suspicions to Rachel; but she, having sojourned
LINE 76: for half a century in this land of sin and sorrow, has learned to be
LINE 77: suspicious herself. She told me from the first she was "down of that
LINE 78: new governess," and I soon found she watched her quite as narrowly as I
LINE 79: did; and I was glad of it, for I longed to know the truth: the
LINE 80: atmosphere of Grassdale seemed to stifle me, and I could only live by
LINE 81: thinking of Wildfell Hall.
LINE 82: At last, one morning, she entered my chamber with such intelligence
LINE 83: that my resolution was taken before she had ceased to speak. While she
LINE 84: dressed me I explained to her my intentions and what assistance I
LINE 85: should require from her, and told her which of my things she was to
LINE 86: pack up, and what she was to leave behind for herself, as I had no
LINE 87: other means of recompensing her for this sudden dismissal after her
LINE 88: long and faithful service: a circumstance I most deeply regretted, but
LINE 89: could not avoid.
LINE 90: "And what will you do, Rachel?" said I; "will you go home, or seek
LINE 91: another place?"
LINE 92: "I have no home, ma'am, but with you," she replied; "and if I leave you
LINE 93: I'll never go into place again as long as I live."
LINE 94: "But I can't afford to live like a lady now," returned I: "I must be my
LINE 95: own maid and my child's nurse."
LINE 96: "What _signifies!_" replied she, in some excitement. "You'll want
LINE 97: somebody to clean and wash, and cook, won't you? I can do all that; and
LINE 98: never mind the wages: I've my bits o' savings yet, and if you wouldn't
LINE 99: take me I should have to find my own board and lodging out of 'em
LINE 100: somewhere, or else work among strangers: and it's what I'm not used to:
LINE 101: so you can please yourself, ma'am." Her voice quavered as she spoke,
LINE 102: and the tears stood in her eyes.
LINE 103: "I should like it above all things, Rachel, and I'd give you such wages
LINE 104: as I could afford: such as I should give to any servant-of-all-work I
LINE 105: might employ: but don't you see I should be dragging you down with me
LINE 106: when you have done nothing to deserve it?"
LINE 107: "Oh, fiddle!" ejaculated she.
LINE 108: "And, besides, my future way of living will be so widely different to
LINE 109: the past: so different to all you have been accustomed to—"
LINE 110: "Do you think, ma'am, I can't bear what my missis can? surely I'm not
LINE 111: so proud and so dainty as that comes to; and my little master, too, God
LINE 112: bless him!"
LINE 113: "But I'm young, Rachel; I sha'n't mind it; and Arthur is young too: it
LINE 114: will be nothing to him."
LINE 115: "Nor me either: I'm not so old but what I can stand hard fare and hard
LINE 116: work, if it's only to help and comfort them as I've loved like my own
LINE 117: bairns: for all I'm too old to bide the thoughts o' leaving 'em in
LINE 118: trouble and danger, and going amongst strangers myself."
LINE 119: "Then you sha'n't, Rachel!" cried I, embracing my faithful friend.
LINE 120: "We'll all go together, and you shall see how the new life suits you."
LINE 121: "Bless you, honey!" cried she, affectionately returning my embrace.
LINE 122: "Only let us get shut of this wicked house, and we'll do right enough,
LINE 123: you'll see."
LINE 124: "So think I," was my answer; and so that point was settled.
LINE 125: By that morning's post I despatched a few hasty lines to Frederick,
LINE 126: beseeching him to prepare my asylum for my immediate reception: for I
LINE 127: should probably come to claim it within a day after the receipt of that
LINE 128: note: and telling him, in few words, the cause of my sudden resolution.
LINE 129: I then wrote three letters of adieu: the first to Esther Hargrave, in
LINE 130: which I told her that I found it impossible to stay any longer at
LINE 131: Grassdale, or to leave my son under his father's protection; and, as it
LINE 132: was of the last importance that our future abode should be unknown to
LINE 133: him and his acquaintance, I should disclose it to no one but my
LINE 134: brother, through the medium of whom I hoped still to correspond with my
LINE 135: friends. I then gave her his address, exhorted her to write frequently,
LINE 136: reiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own concerns,
LINE 137: and bade her a fond farewell.
LINE 138: The second was to Milicent; much to the same effect, but a little more
LINE 139: confidential, as befitted our longer intimacy, and her greater
LINE 140: experience and better acquaintance with my circumstances.
LINE 141: The third was to my aunt: a much more difficult and painful
LINE 142: undertaking, and therefore I had left it to the last; but I must give
LINE 143: her some explanation of that extraordinary step I had taken: and that
LINE 144: quickly, for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or
LINE 145: two after my disappearance, as it was probable that Mr. Huntingdon
LINE 146: would speedily apply to them to know what was become of me. At last,
LINE 147: however, I told her I was sensible of my error: I did not complain of
LINE 148: its punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its
LINE 149: consequences; but in duty to my son I must submit no longer; it was
LINE 150: absolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his father's
LINE 151: corrupting influence. I should not disclose my place of refuge even to
LINE 152: her, in order that she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny
LINE 153: all knowledge concerning it; but any communications addressed to me
LINE 154: under cover to my brother would be certain to reach me. I hoped she and
LINE 155: my uncle would pardon the step I had taken, for if they knew all, I was
LINE 156: sure they would not blame me; and I trusted they would not afflict
LINE 157: themselves on my account, for if I could only reach my retreat in
LINE 158: safety and keep it unmolested, I should be very happy, but for the
LINE 159: thoughts of them; and should be quite contented to spend my life in
LINE 160: obscurity, devoting myself to the training up of my child, and teaching
LINE 161: him to avoid the errors of both his parents.
LINE 162: These things were done yesterday: I have given two whole days to the
LINE 163: preparation for our departure, that Frederick may have more time to
LINE 164: prepare the rooms, and Rachel to pack up the things: for the latter
LINE 165: task must be done with the utmost caution and secrecy, and there is no
LINE 166: one but me to assist her. I can help to get the articles together, but
LINE 167: I do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes, so as to
LINE 168: take up the smallest possible space; and there are her own things to
LINE 169: do, as well as mine and Arthur's. I can ill afford to leave anything
LINE 170: behind, since I have no money, except a few guineas in my purse; and
LINE 171: besides, as Rachel observed, whatever I left would most likely become
LINE 172: the property of Miss Myers, and I should not relish that.
LINE 173: But what trouble I have had throughout these two days, struggling to
LINE 174: appear calm and collected, to meet him and her as usual, when I was
LINE 175: obliged to meet them, and forcing myself to leave my little Arthur in
LINE 176: her hands for hours together! But I trust these trials are over now: I
LINE 177: have laid him in my bed for better security, and never more, I trust,
LINE 178: shall his innocent lips be defiled by their contaminating kisses, or
LINE 179: his young ears polluted by their words. But shall we escape in safety?
LINE 180: Oh, that the morning were come, and we were on our way at least! This
LINE 181: evening, when I had given Rachel all the assistance I could, and had
LINE 182: nothing left me but to wait, and wish and tremble, I became so greatly
LINE 183: agitated that I knew not what to do. I went down to dinner, but I could
LINE 184: not force myself to eat. Mr. Huntingdon remarked the circumstance.
LINE 185: "What's to do with you _now?_" said he, when the removal of the second
LINE 186: course gave him time to look about him.
LINE 187: "I am not well," I replied: "I think I must lie down a little; you
LINE 188: won't miss me much?"
LINE 189: "Not the least: if you leave your chair, it'll do just as well—better,
LINE 190: a trifle," he muttered, as I left the room, "for I can fancy somebody
LINE 191: else fills it."
LINE 192: "Somebody else _may_ fill it to-morrow," I thought, but did not say.
LINE 193: "There! I've seen the last of _you_, I hope," I muttered, as I closed
LINE 194: the door upon him.
LINE 195: Rachel urged me to seek repose at once, to recruit my strength for
LINE 196: to-morrow's journey, as we must be gone before the dawn; but in my
LINE 197: present state of nervous excitement that was entirely out of the
LINE 198: question. It was equally out of the question to sit, or wander about my
LINE 199: room, counting the hours and the minutes between me and the appointed
LINE 200: time of action, straining my ears and trembling at every sound, lest
LINE 201: someone should discover and betray us after all. I took up a book and
LINE 202: tried to read: my eyes wandered over the pages, but it was impossible
LINE 203: to bind my thoughts to their contents. Why not have recourse to the old
LINE 204: expedient, and add this last event to my chronicle? I opened its pages
LINE 205: once more, and wrote the above account—with difficulty, at first, but
LINE 206: gradually my mind became more calm and steady. Thus several hours have
LINE 207: passed away: the time is drawing near; and now my eyes feel heavy and
LINE 208: my frame exhausted. I will commend my cause to God, and then lie down
LINE 209: and gain an hour or two of sleep; and _then!_—
LINE 210: Little Arthur sleeps soundly. All the house is still: there can be no
LINE 211: one watching. The boxes were all corded by Benson, and quietly conveyed
LINE 212: down the back stairs after dusk, and sent away in a cart to the M——
LINE 213: coach-office. The name upon the cards was Mrs. Graham, which
LINE 214: appellation I mean henceforth to adopt. My mother's maiden name was
LINE 215: Graham, and therefore I fancy I have some claim to it, and prefer it to
LINE 216: any other, except my own, which I dare not resume.
