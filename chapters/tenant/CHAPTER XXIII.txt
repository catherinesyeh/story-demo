LINE 1: Feb. 18, 1822.—Early this morning Arthur mounted his hunter and set off
LINE 2: in high glee to meet the —— hounds. He will be away all day, and so I
LINE 3: will amuse myself with my neglected diary, if I can give that name to
LINE 4: such an irregular composition. It is exactly four months since I opened
LINE 5: it last.
LINE 6: I am married now, and settled down as Mrs. Huntingdon of Grassdale
LINE 7: Manor. I have had eight weeks' experience of matrimony. And do I regret
LINE 8: the step I have taken? No, though I must confess, in my secret heart,
LINE 9: that Arthur is not what I thought him at first, and if I had known him
LINE 10: in the beginning as thoroughly as I do now, I probably never should
LINE 11: have loved him, and if I loved him first, and then made the discovery,
LINE 12: I fear I should have thought it my duty not to have married him. To be
LINE 13: sure I might have known him, for every one was willing enough to tell
LINE 14: me about him, and he himself was no accomplished hypocrite, but I was
LINE 15: wilfully blind; and now, instead of regretting that I did not discern
LINE 16: his full character before I was indissolubly bound to him, I am _glad_,
LINE 17: for it has saved me a great deal of battling with my conscience, and a
LINE 18: great deal of consequent trouble and pain; and, whatever I _ought_ to
LINE 19: have done, my duty now is plainly to love him and to cleave to him, and
LINE 20: this just tallies with my inclination.
LINE 21: He is very fond of me, almost _too_ fond. I could do with less
LINE 22: caressing and more rationality. I should like to be less of a pet and
LINE 23: more of a friend, if I might choose; but I won't complain of that: I am
LINE 24: only afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains in ardour. I
LINE 25: sometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches compared with
LINE 26: one of solid coal, very bright and hot; but if it should burn itself
LINE 27: out and leave nothing but ashes behind, what shall I do? But it won't,
LINE 28: it _shan_'t, I am determined; and surely I have power to keep it alive.
LINE 29: So let me dismiss _that_ thought at once. But Arthur is selfish; I am
LINE 30: constrained to acknowledge that; and, indeed, the admission gives me
LINE 31: less pain than might be expected, for, since _I_ love him so much, I
LINE 32: can easily forgive him for loving himself: he likes to be pleased, and
LINE 33: it is my delight to please him; and when I regret this tendency of his,
LINE 34: it is for his own sake, not for mine.
LINE 35: The first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour. He
LINE 36: wanted to hurry it over, for all the continental scenes were already
LINE 37: familiar to him: many had lost their interest in his eyes, and others
LINE 38: had never had anything to lose. The consequence was, that after a
LINE 39: flying transit through part of France and part of Italy, I came back
LINE 40: nearly as ignorant as I went, having made no acquaintance with persons
LINE 41: and manners, and very little with things, my head swarming with a
LINE 42: motley confusion of objects and scenes; some, it is true, leaving a
LINE 43: deeper and more pleasing impression than others, but these embittered
LINE 44: by the recollection that my emotions had not been shared by my
LINE 45: companion, but that, on the contrary, when I had expressed a particular
LINE 46: interest in anything that I saw or desired to see, it had been
LINE 47: displeasing to him, inasmuch as it proved that I could take delight in
LINE 48: anything disconnected with himself.
LINE 49: [Illustration]
LINE 50: As for Paris, we only just touched at that, and he would not give me
LINE 51: time to see one-tenth of the beauties and interesting objects of Rome.
LINE 52: He wanted to get me home, he said, to have me all to himself, and to
LINE 53: see me safely installed as the mistress of Grassdale Manor, just as
LINE 54: single-minded, as naïve, and piquante as I was; and as if I had been
LINE 55: some frail butterfly, he expressed himself fearful of rubbing the
LINE 56: silver off my wings by bringing me into contact with society,
LINE 57: especially that of Paris and Rome; and, more-over, he did not scruple
LINE 58: to tell me that there were ladies in both places that would tear his
LINE 59: eyes out if they happened to meet him with me.
LINE 60: Of course I was vexed at all this; but still it was less the
LINE 61: disappointment to myself that annoyed me, than the disappointment _in
LINE 62: him_, and the trouble I was at to frame excuses to my friends for
LINE 63: having seen and observed so little, without imputing one particle of
LINE 64: blame to my companion. But when we got home—to my new, delightful
LINE 65: home—I was so happy and he was so kind that I freely forgave him all;
LINE 66: and I was beginning to think my lot _too_ happy, and my husband
LINE 67: actually too good for me, if not too good for this world, when, on the
LINE 68: second Sunday after our arrival, he shocked and horrified me by another
LINE 69: instance of his unreasonable exaction. We were walking home from the
LINE 70: morning service, for it was a fine frosty day, and as we are so near
LINE 71: the church, I had requested the carriage should not be used.
LINE 72: "Helen," said he, with unusual gravity, "I am not quite satisfied with
LINE 73: you."
LINE 74: I desired to know what was wrong.
LINE 75: "But will you promise to reform if I tell you?"
LINE 76: "Yes, if I can, and without offending a higher authority."
LINE 77: "Ah! there it is, you see: you don't love me with all your heart."
LINE 78: "I don't understand you, Arthur (at least I hope I don't): pray tell me
LINE 79: what I have done or said amiss."
LINE 80: "It is nothing you have done or said; it is something that you _are:_
LINE 81: you are too religious. Now I like a woman to be religious, and I think
LINE 82: your piety one of your greatest charms; but then, like all other good
LINE 83: things, it may be carried too far. To my thinking, a woman's religion
LINE 84: ought not to lessen her devotion to her earthly lord. She should have
LINE 85: enough to purify and etherealise her soul, but not enough to refine
LINE 86: away her heart, and raise her above all human sympathies."
LINE 87: "And am _I_ above all human sympathies?" said I.
LINE 88: "No, darling; but you are making more progress towards that saintly
LINE 89: condition than I like; for all these two hours I have been thinking of
LINE 90: you and wanting to catch your eye, and you were so absorbed in your
LINE 91: devotions that you had not even a glance to spare for me—I declare it
LINE 92: is enough to make one jealous of one's Maker—which is very wrong, you
LINE 93: know; so don't excite such wicked passions again, for my soul's sake."
LINE 94: "I will give my whole heart and soul to my Maker if I can," I answered,
LINE 95: "and not one atom more of it to you than He allows. What are _you_,
LINE 96: sir, that you should set yourself up as a god, and presume to dispute
LINE 97: possession of my heart with Him to whom I owe all I have and all I am,
LINE 98: every blessing I ever did or ever can enjoy—and yourself among the
LINE 99: rest—if you _are_ a blessing, which I am half inclined to doubt."
LINE 100: "Don't be so hard upon me, Helen; and don't pinch my arm so: you are
LINE 101: squeezing your fingers into the bone."
LINE 102: "Arthur," continued I, relaxing my hold of his arm, "you don't love me
LINE 103: half as much as I do you; and yet, if you loved me far less than you
LINE 104: do, I would not complain, provided you loved your Maker more. I should
LINE 105: _rejoice_ to see you at any time so deeply absorbed in your devotions
LINE 106: that you had not a single thought to spare for me. But, indeed, I
LINE 107: should lose nothing by the change, for the more you loved your God the
LINE 108: more deep and pure and true would be your love to me."
LINE 109: At this he only laughed and kissed my hand, calling me a sweet
LINE 110: enthusiast. Then taking off his hat, he added: "But look here,
LINE 111: Helen—what can a man do with such a head as this?"
LINE 112: The head looked right enough, but when he placed my hand on the top of
LINE 113: it, it sunk in a bed of curls, rather alarmingly low, especially in the
LINE 114: middle.
LINE 115: "You see I was not made to be a saint," said he, laughing, "If God
LINE 116: meant me to be religious, why didn't He give me a proper organ of
LINE 117: veneration?"
LINE 118: "You are like the servant," I replied, "who, instead of employing his
LINE 119: one talent in his master's service, restored it to him unimproved,
LINE 120: alleging, as an excuse, that he knew him 'to be a hard man, reaping
LINE 121: where he had not sown, and gathering where he had not strawed.' Of him
LINE 122: to whom less is given, less will be required, but our utmost exertions
LINE 123: are required of us all. You are not without the capacity of veneration,
LINE 124: and faith and hope, and conscience and reason, and every other
LINE 125: requisite to a Christian's character, if you choose to employ them; but
LINE 126: all our talents increase in the using, and every faculty, both good and
LINE 127: bad, strengthens by exercise: therefore, if you choose to use the bad,
LINE 128: or those which tend to evil, till they become your masters, and neglect
LINE 129: the good till they dwindle away, you have only yourself to blame. But
LINE 130: you _have_ talents, Arthur—natural endowments both of heart and mind
LINE 131: and temper, such as many a better Christian would be glad to possess,
LINE 132: if you would only employ them in God's service. I should never expect
LINE 133: to see you a devotee, but it is quite possible to be a good Christian
LINE 134: without ceasing to be a happy, merry-hearted man."
LINE 135: "You speak like an oracle, Helen, and all you say is indisputably true;
LINE 136: but listen here: I am hungry, and I see before me a good substantial
LINE 137: dinner; I am told that if I abstain from this to-day I shall have a
LINE 138: sumptuous feast to-morrow, consisting of all manner of dainties and
LINE 139: delicacies. Now, in the first place, I should be loth to wait till
LINE 140: to-morrow when I have the means of appeasing my hunger already before
LINE 141: me: in the second place, the solid viands of to-day are more to my
LINE 142: taste than the dainties that are promised me; in the third place, I
LINE 143: don't _see_ to-morrow's banquet, and how can I tell that it is not all
LINE 144: a fable, got up by the greasy-faced fellow that is advising me to
LINE 145: abstain in order that he may have all the good victuals to himself? in
LINE 146: the fourth place, this table must be spread for somebody, and, as
LINE 147: Solomon says, 'Who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto more than
LINE 148: I?' and finally, with your leave, I'll sit down and satisfy my cravings
LINE 149: of to-day, and leave to-morrow to shift for itself—who knows but what I
LINE 150: may secure both this and that?"
LINE 151: "But you are not required to abstain from the substantial dinner of
LINE 152: to-day: you are only advised to partake of these coarser viands in such
LINE 153: moderation as not to incapacitate you from enjoying the choicer banquet
LINE 154: of to-morrow. If, regardless of that counsel, you choose to make a
LINE 155: beast of yourself now, and over-eat and over-drink yourself till you
LINE 156: turn the good victuals into poison, who is to blame if, hereafter,
LINE 157: while you are suffering the torments of yesterday's gluttony and
LINE 158: drunkenness, you see more temperate men sitting down to enjoy
LINE 159: themselves at that splendid entertainment which you are unable to
LINE 160: taste?"
LINE 161: "Most true, my patron saint; but again, our friend Solomon says, 'There
LINE 162: is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink, and to be
LINE 163: merry.'"
LINE 164: "And again," returned I, "he says, 'Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth;
LINE 165: and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes:
LINE 166: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into
LINE 167: judgment.'"
LINE 168: "Well, but, Helen, I'm sure I've been very good these last few weeks.
LINE 169: What have you seen amiss in me, and what would you have me to do?"
LINE 170: "Nothing more than you do, Arthur: your actions are all right so far;
LINE 171: but I would have your thoughts changed; I would have you to fortify
LINE 172: yourself against temptation, and not to call evil good, and good evil;
LINE 173: I should wish you to think more deeply, to look further, and aim higher
LINE 174: than you do."
