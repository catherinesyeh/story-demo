LINE 1: The tardy gig had overtaken me at last. I entered it, and bade the man
LINE 2: who brought it drive to Grassdale Manor—I was too busy with my own
LINE 3: thoughts to care to drive it myself. I would see Mrs. Huntingdon—there
LINE 4: could be no impropriety in that now that her husband had been dead
LINE 5: above a year—and by her indifference or her joy at my unexpected
LINE 6: arrival I could soon tell whether her heart was truly mine. But my
LINE 7: companion, a loquacious, forward fellow, was not disposed to leave me
LINE 8: to the indulgence of my private cogitations.
LINE 9: "There they go!" said he, as the carriages filed away before us.
LINE 10: "There'll be brave doings on yonder _to-day_, as what come
LINE 11: to-morra.—Know anything of that family, sir? or you're a stranger in
LINE 12: these parts?"
LINE 13: "I know them by report."
LINE 14: "Humph! There's the best of 'em gone, anyhow. And I suppose the old
LINE 15: missis is agoing to leave after this stir's gotten overed, and take
LINE 16: herself off, somewhere, to live on her bit of a jointure; and the young
LINE 17: 'un—at least the new 'un (she's none so very young)—is coming down to
LINE 18: live at the Grove."
LINE 19: "Is Mr. Hargrave married, then?"
LINE 20: "Ay, sir, a few months since. He should a been wed afore, to a widow
LINE 21: lady, but they couldn't agree over the money: she'd a rare long purse,
LINE 22: and Mr. Hargrave wanted it all to hisself; but she wouldn't let it go,
LINE 23: and so then they fell out. This one isn't quite as rich, nor as
LINE 24: handsome either, but she hasn't been married before. She's very plain,
LINE 25: they say, and getting on to forty or past, and so, you know, if she
LINE 26: didn't jump at this hopportunity, she thought she'd never get a better.
LINE 27: I guess she thought such a handsome young husband was worth all 'at
LINE 28: ever she had, and he might take it and welcome, but I lay she'll rue
LINE 29: her bargain afore long. They say she begins already to see 'at he isn't
LINE 30: not altogether that nice, generous, perlite, delightful gentleman 'at
LINE 31: she thought him afore marriage—he begins a being careless and masterful
LINE 32: already. Ay, and she'll find him harder and carelesser nor she thinks
LINE 33: on."
LINE 34: "You seem to be well acquainted with him," I observed.
LINE 35: "I am, sir; I've known him since he was quite a young gentleman; and a
LINE 36: proud 'un he was, and a wilful. I was servant yonder for several years;
LINE 37: but I couldn't stand their niggardly ways—she got ever longer and
LINE 38: worse, did missis, with her nipping and screwing, and watching and
LINE 39: grudging; so I thought I'd find another place."
LINE 40: "Are we not near the house?" said I, interrupting him.
LINE 41: "Yes, sir; yond's the park."
LINE 42: My heart sank within me to behold that stately mansion in the midst of
LINE 43: its expansive grounds. The park as beautiful now, in its wintry garb,
LINE 44: as it could be in its summer glory: the majestic sweep, the undulating
LINE 45: swell and fall, displayed to full advantage in that robe of dazzling
LINE 46: purity, stainless and printless—save one long, winding track left by
LINE 47: the trooping deer—the stately timber-trees with their heavy-laden
LINE 48: branches gleaming white against the dull, grey sky; the deep,
LINE 49: encircling woods; the broad expanse of water sleeping in frozen quiet;
LINE 50: and the weeping ash and willow drooping their snow-clad boughs above
LINE 51: it—all presented a picture, striking indeed, and pleasing to an
LINE 52: unencumbered mind, but by no means encouraging to me. There was one
LINE 53: comfort, however,—all this was entailed upon little Arthur, and could
LINE 54: not under any circumstances, strictly speaking, be his mother's. But
LINE 55: how was she situated? Overcoming with a sudden effort my repugnance to
LINE 56: mention her name to my garrulous companion, I asked him if he knew
LINE 57: whether her late husband had left a will, and how the property had been
LINE 58: disposed of. Oh, yes, he knew all about it; and I was quickly informed
LINE 59: that to her had been left the full control and management of the estate
LINE 60: during her son's minority, besides the absolute, unconditional
LINE 61: possession of her own fortune (but I knew that her father had not given
LINE 62: her much), and the small additional sum that had been settled upon her
LINE 63: before marriage.
LINE 64: Before the close of the explanation we drew up at the park-gates. Now
LINE 65: for the trial. If I should find her within—but alas! she might be still
LINE 66: at Staningley: her brother had given me no intimation to the contrary.
LINE 67: I inquired at the porter's lodge if Mrs. Huntingdon were at home. No,
LINE 68: she was with her aunt in ——shire, but was expected to return before
LINE 69: Christmas. She usually spent most of her time at Staningley, only
LINE 70: coming to Grassdale occasionally, when the management of affairs, or
LINE 71: the interest of her tenants and dependents, required her presence.
LINE 72: "Near what town is Staningley situated?" I asked. The requisite
LINE 73: information was soon obtained. "Now then, my man, give me the reins,
LINE 74: and we'll return to M——. I must have some breakfast at the 'Rose and
LINE 75: Crown,' and then away to Staningley by the first coach for ——."
LINE 76: At M—— I had time before the coach started to replenish my forces with
LINE 77: a hearty breakfast, and to obtain the refreshment of my usual morning's
LINE 78: ablutions, and the amelioration of some slight change in my toilet, and
LINE 79: also to despatch a short note to my mother (excellent son that I was),
LINE 80: to assure her that I was still in existence, and to excuse my
LINE 81: non-appearance at the expected time. It was a long journey to
LINE 82: Staningley for those slow-travelling days, but I did not deny myself
LINE 83: needful refreshment on the road, nor even a night's rest at a wayside
LINE 84: inn, choosing rather to brook a little delay than to present myself
LINE 85: worn, wild, and weather-beaten before my mistress and her aunt, who
LINE 86: would be astonished enough to see me without that. Next morning,
LINE 87: therefore, I not only fortified myself with as substantial a breakfast
LINE 88: as my excited feelings would allow me to swallow, but I bestowed a
LINE 89: little more than usual time and care upon my toilet; and, furnished
LINE 90: with a change of linen from my small carpet-bag, well-brushed clothes,
LINE 91: well-polished boots, and neat new gloves, I mounted "The Lightning,"
LINE 92: and resumed my journey. I had nearly two stages yet before me, but the
LINE 93: coach, I was informed, passed through the neighbourhood of Staningley,
LINE 94: and having desired to be set down as near the Hall as possible, I had
LINE 95: nothing to do but to sit with folded arms and speculate upon the coming
LINE 96: hour.
LINE 97: It was a clear, frosty morning. The very fact of sitting exalted aloft,
LINE 98: surveying the snowy landscape and sweet sunny sky, inhaling the pure,
LINE 99: bracing air, and crunching away over the crisp frozen snow, was
LINE 100: exhilarating enough in itself; but add to this the idea of to what goal
LINE 101: I was hastening, and whom I expected to meet, and you may have some
LINE 102: faint conception of my frame of mind at the time—only a _faint_ one,
LINE 103: though, for my heart swelled with unspeakable delight, and my spirits
LINE 104: rose almost to madness, in spite of my prudent endeavours to bind them
LINE 105: down to a reasonable platitude by thinking of the undeniable difference
LINE 106: between Helen's rank and mine; of all that she had passed through since
LINE 107: our parting; of her long, unbroken silence; and, above all, of her
LINE 108: cool, cautious aunt, whose counsels she would doubtless be careful not
LINE 109: to slight again. These considerations made my heart flutter with
LINE 110: anxiety, and my chest heave with impatience to get the crisis over; but
LINE 111: they could not dim her image in my mind, or mar the vivid recollection
LINE 112: of what had been said and felt between us, or destroy the keen
LINE 113: anticipation of what was to be: in fact, I could not realise their
LINE 114: terrors now. Towards the close of the journey, however, a couple of my
LINE 115: fellow-passengers kindly came to my assistance, and brought me low
LINE 116: enough.
LINE 117: "Fine land this," said one of them, pointing with his umbrella to the
LINE 118: wide fields on the right, conspicuous for their compact hedgerows,
LINE 119: deep, well-cut ditches, and fine timber-trees, growing sometimes on the
LINE 120: borders, sometimes in the midst of the enclosure: "_very_ fine land, if
LINE 121: you saw it in the summer or spring."
LINE 122: "Ay," responded the other, a gruff elderly man, with a drab greatcoat
LINE 123: buttoned up to the chin, and a cotton umbrella between his knees. "It's
LINE 124: old Maxwell's, I suppose."
LINE 125: "It _was_ his, sir; but he's dead now, you're aware, and has left it
LINE 126: all to his niece."
LINE 127: "All?"
LINE 128: "Every rood of it, and the mansion-house and all! every hatom of his
LINE 129: worldly goods, except just a trifle, by way of remembrance, to his
LINE 130: nephew down in ——shire, and an annuity to his wife."
LINE 131: "It's strange, sir!"
LINE 132: "It is, sir; and she wasn't his own niece neither. But he had no near
LINE 133: relations of his own—none but a nephew he'd quarrelled with; and he
LINE 134: always had a partiality for this one. And then his wife advised him to
LINE 135: it, they say: she'd brought most of the property, and it was her wish
LINE 136: that this lady should have it."
LINE 137: "Humph! She'll be a fine catch for somebody."
LINE 138: "She will so. She's a widow, but quite young yet, and uncommon
LINE 139: handsome: a fortune of her own, besides, and only one child, and she's
LINE 140: nursing a fine estate for him in ——. There'll be lots to speak for her!
LINE 141: 'fraid there's no chance for uz"—(facetiously jogging me with his
LINE 142: elbow, as well as his companion)—"ha, ha, ha! No offence, sir, I
LINE 143: hope?"—(to me). "Ahem! I should think she'll marry none but a nobleman
LINE 144: myself. Look ye, sir," resumed he, turning to his other neighbour, and
LINE 145: pointing past me with his umbrella, "that's the Hall: grand park, you
LINE 146: see, and all them woods—plenty of timber there, and lots of game.
LINE 147: Hallo! what now?"
LINE 148: This exclamation was occasioned by the sudden stoppage of the coach at
LINE 149: the park-gates.
LINE 150: "Gen'leman for Staningley Hall?" cried the coachman and I rose and
LINE 151: threw my carpet-bag on to the ground, preparatory to dropping myself
LINE 152: down after it.
LINE 153: "Sickly, sir?" asked my talkative neighbour, staring me in the face. I
LINE 154: daresay it was white enough.
LINE 155: "No. Here, coachman!"
LINE 156: "Thank'ee, sir.—All right!"
LINE 157: The coachman pocketed his fee and drove away, leaving me, not walking
LINE 158: up the park, but pacing to and fro before its gates, with folded arms,
LINE 159: and eyes fixed upon the ground, an overwhelming force of images,
LINE 160: thoughts, impressions crowding on my mind, and nothing tangibly
LINE 161: distinct but this: My love had been cherished in vain—my hope was gone
LINE 162: for ever; I must tear myself away at once, and banish or suppress all
LINE 163: thoughts of her, like the remembrance of a wild, mad dream. Gladly
LINE 164: would I have lingered round the place for hours, in the hope of
LINE 165: catching at least one distant glimpse of her before I went, but it must
LINE 166: not be—I must not suffer her to see me; for what could have brought me
LINE 167: hither but the hope of reviving her attachment, with a view hereafter
LINE 168: to obtain her hand? And could I bear that she should think me capable
LINE 169: of such a thing?—of presuming upon the acquaintance—the _love_, if you
LINE 170: will—accidentally contracted, or rather forced upon her against her
LINE 171: will, when she was an unknown fugitive, toiling for her own support,
LINE 172: apparently without fortune, family, or connections; to come upon her
LINE 173: now, when she was reinstated in her proper sphere, and claim a share in
LINE 174: her prosperity, which, had it never failed her, would most certainly
LINE 175: have kept her unknown to me for ever? And this, too, when we had parted
LINE 176: sixteen months ago, and she had expressly forbidden me to hope for a
LINE 177: re-union in this world, and never sent me a line or a message from that
LINE 178: day to this. No! The very idea was intolerable.
LINE 179: And even if she should have a lingering affection for me still, ought I
LINE 180: to disturb her peace by awakening those feelings? to subject her to the
LINE 181: struggles of conflicting duty and inclination—to whichsoever side the
LINE 182: latter might allure, or the former imperatively call her—whether she
LINE 183: should deem it her duty to risk the slights and censures of the world,
LINE 184: the sorrow and displeasure of those she loved, for a romantic idea of
LINE 185: truth and constancy to me, or to sacrifice her individual wishes to the
LINE 186: feelings of her friends and her own sense of prudence and the fitness
LINE 187: of things? No—and I would not! I would go at once, and she should never
LINE 188: know that I had approached the place of her abode: for though I might
LINE 189: disclaim all idea of ever aspiring to her hand, or even of soliciting a
LINE 190: place in her friendly regard, her peace should not be broken by my
LINE 191: presence, nor her heart afflicted by the sight of my fidelity.
LINE 192: "Adieu then, dear Helen, forever! Forever adieu!"
LINE 193: So said I—and yet I could not tear myself away. I moved a few paces,
LINE 194: and then looked back, for one last view of her stately home, that I
LINE 195: might have its outward form, at least, impressed upon my mind as
LINE 196: indelibly as her own image, which, alas! I must not see again—then
LINE 197: walked a few steps further; and then, lost in melancholy musings,
LINE 198: paused again and leant my back against a rough old tree that grew
LINE 199: beside the road.
