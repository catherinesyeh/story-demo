LINE 1: Our party, on the 5th of November, passed off very well, in spite of
LINE 2: Mrs. Graham's refusal to grace it with her presence. Indeed, it is
LINE 3: probable that, had she been there, there would have been less
LINE 4: cordiality, freedom, and frolic amongst us than there was without her.
LINE 5: My mother, as usual, was cheerful and chatty, full of activity and
LINE 6: good-nature, and only faulty in being too anxious to make her guests
LINE 7: happy, thereby forcing several of them to do what their soul abhorred
LINE 8: in the way of eating or drinking, sitting opposite the blazing fire, or
LINE 9: talking when they would be silent. Nevertheless, they bore it very
LINE 10: well, being all in their holiday humours.
LINE 11: Mr. Millward was mighty in important dogmas and sententious jokes,
LINE 12: pompous anecdotes and oracular discourses, dealt out for the
LINE 13: edification of the whole assembly in general, and of the admiring Mrs.
LINE 14: Markham, the polite Mr. Lawrence, the sedate Mary Millward, the quiet
LINE 15: Richard Wilson, and the matter-of-fact Robert in particular,—as being
LINE 16: the most attentive listeners.
LINE 17: Mrs. Wilson was more brilliant than ever, with her budgets of fresh
LINE 18: news and old scandal, strung together with trivial questions and
LINE 19: remarks, and oft-repeated observations, uttered apparently for the sole
LINE 20: purpose of denying a moment's rest to her inexhaustible organs of
LINE 21: speech. She had brought her knitting with her, and it seemed as if her
LINE 22: tongue had laid a wager with her fingers, to outdo them in swift and
LINE 23: ceaseless motion.
LINE 24: Her daughter Jane was, of course, as graceful and elegant, as witty and
LINE 25: seductive, as she could possibly manage to be; for here were all the
LINE 26: ladies to outshine, and all the gentlemen to charm,—and Mr. Lawrence,
LINE 27: especially, to capture and subdue. Her little arts to effect his
LINE 28: subjugation were too subtle and impalpable to attract my observation;
LINE 29: but I thought there was a certain _refined_ affectation of superiority,
LINE 30: and an ungenial self-consciousness about her, that negatived all her
LINE 31: advantages; and after she was gone, Rose interpreted to me her various
LINE 32: looks, words, and actions with a mingled acuteness and asperity that
LINE 33: made me wonder, equally, at the lady's artifice and my sister's
LINE 34: penetration, and ask myself if she too had an eye to the squire—but
LINE 35: never mind, Halford; she had not.
LINE 36: Richard Wilson, Jane's younger brother, sat in a corner, apparently
LINE 37: good-tempered, but silent and shy, desirous to escape observation, but
LINE 38: willing enough to listen and observe: and, although somewhat out of his
LINE 39: element, he would have been happy enough in his own quiet way, if my
LINE 40: mother could only have let him alone; but in her mistaken kindness, she
LINE 41: would keep persecuting him with her attentions—pressing upon him all
LINE 42: manner of viands, under the notion that he was too bashful to help
LINE 43: himself, and obliging him to shout across the room his monosyllabic
LINE 44: replies to the numerous questions and observations by which she vainly
LINE 45: attempted to draw him into conversation.
LINE 46: Rose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his company
LINE 47: but for the importunities of his sister Jane, who was most anxious to
LINE 48: show Mr. Lawrence that she had at least one brother more gentlemanly
LINE 49: and refined than Robert. That worthy individual she had been equally
LINE 50: solicitous to keep away; but he affirmed that he saw no reason why he
LINE 51: should not enjoy a crack with Markham and the old lady (my mother was
LINE 52: not old, really), and bonny Miss Rose and the parson, as well as the
LINE 53: best;—and he was in the right of it too. So he talked common-place with
LINE 54: my mother and Rose, and discussed parish affairs with the vicar,
LINE 55: farming matters with me, and politics with us both.
LINE 56: Mary Millward was another mute,—not so much tormented with cruel
LINE 57: kindness as Dick Wilson, because she had a certain short, decided way
LINE 58: of answering and refusing, and was supposed to be rather sullen than
LINE 59: diffident. However that might be, she certainly did not give much
LINE 60: pleasure to the company;—nor did she appear to derive much from it.
LINE 61: Eliza told me she had only come because her father insisted upon it,
LINE 62: having taken it into his head that she devoted herself too exclusively
LINE 63: to her household duties, to the neglect of such relaxations and
LINE 64: innocent enjoyments as were proper to her age and sex. She seemed to me
LINE 65: to be good-humoured enough on the whole. Once or twice she was provoked
LINE 66: to laughter by the wit or the merriment of some favoured individual
LINE 67: amongst us; and then I observed she sought the eye of Richard Wilson,
LINE 68: who sat over against her. As he studied with her father, she had some
LINE 69: acquaintance with him, in spite of the retiring habits of both, and I
LINE 70: suppose there was a kind of fellow-feeling established between them.
LINE 71: My Eliza was charming beyond description, coquettish without
LINE 72: affectation, and evidently more desirous to engage my attention than
LINE 73: that of all the room besides. Her delight in having me near her, seated
LINE 74: or standing by her side, whispering in her ear, or pressing her hand in
LINE 75: the dance, was plainly legible in her glowing face and heaving bosom,
LINE 76: however belied by saucy words and gestures. But I had better hold my
LINE 77: tongue: if I boast of these things now, I shall have to blush
LINE 78: hereafter.
LINE 79: To proceed, then, with the various individuals of our party; Rose was
LINE 80: simple and natural as usual, and full of mirth and vivacity.
LINE 81: Fergus was impertinent and absurd; but his impertinence and folly
LINE 82: served to make others laugh, if they did not raise himself in their
LINE 83: estimation.
LINE 84: And finally (for I omit myself), Mr. Lawrence was gentlemanly and
LINE 85: inoffensive to all, and polite to the vicar and the ladies, especially
LINE 86: his hostess and her daughter, and Miss Wilson—misguided man; he had not
LINE 87: the taste to prefer Eliza Millward. Mr. Lawrence and I were on
LINE 88: tolerably intimate terms. Essentially of reserved habits, and but
LINE 89: seldom quitting the secluded place of his birth, where he had lived in
LINE 90: solitary state since the death of his father, he had neither the
LINE 91: opportunity nor the inclination for forming many acquaintances; and, of
LINE 92: all he had ever known, I (judging by the results) was the companion
LINE 93: most agreeable to his taste. I liked the man well enough, but he was
LINE 94: too cold, and shy, and self-contained, to obtain my cordial sympathies.
LINE 95: A spirit of candour and frankness, when wholly unaccompanied with
LINE 96: coarseness, he admired in others, but he could not acquire it himself.
LINE 97: His excessive reserve upon all his own concerns was, indeed, provoking
LINE 98: and chilly enough; but I forgave it, from a conviction that it
LINE 99: originated less in pride and want of confidence in his friends, than in
LINE 100: a certain morbid feeling of delicacy, and a peculiar diffidence, that
LINE 101: he was sensible of, but wanted energy to overcome. His heart was like a
LINE 102: sensitive plant, that opens for a moment in the sunshine, but curls up
LINE 103: and shrinks into itself at the slightest touch of the finger, or the
LINE 104: lightest breath of wind. And, upon the whole, our intimacy was rather a
LINE 105: mutual predilection than a deep and solid friendship, such as has since
LINE 106: arisen between myself and you, Halford, whom, in spite of your
LINE 107: occasional crustiness, I can liken to nothing so well as an old coat,
LINE 108: unimpeachable in texture, but easy and loose—that has conformed itself
LINE 109: to the shape of the wearer, and which he may use as he pleases, without
LINE 110: being bothered with the fear of spoiling it;—whereas Mr. Lawrence was
LINE 111: like a new garment, all very neat and trim to look at, but so tight in
LINE 112: the elbows, that you would fear to split the seams by the unrestricted
LINE 113: motion of your arms, and so smooth and fine in surface that you scruple
LINE 114: to expose it to a single drop of rain.
LINE 115: Soon after the arrival of the guests, my mother mentioned Mrs. Graham,
LINE 116: regretted she was not there to meet them, and explained to the
LINE 117: Millwards and Wilsons the reasons she had given for neglecting to
LINE 118: return their calls, hoping they would excuse her, as she was sure she
LINE 119: did not mean to be uncivil, and would be glad to see them at any
LINE 120: time.—"But she is a very singular lady, Mr. Lawrence," added she; "we
LINE 121: don't know what to make of her—but I daresay you can tell us something
LINE 122: about her, for she is your tenant, you know,—and she said she knew you
LINE 123: a little."
LINE 124: All eyes were turned to Mr. Lawrence. I thought he looked unnecessarily
LINE 125: confused at being so appealed to.
LINE 126: "I, Mrs. Markham!" said he; "you are mistaken—I don't—that is—I have
LINE 127: seen her, certainly; but I am the last person you should apply to for
LINE 128: information respecting Mrs. Graham."
LINE 129: He then immediately turned to Rose, and asked her to favour the company
LINE 130: with a song, or a tune on the piano.
LINE 131: "No," said she, "you must ask Miss Wilson: she outshines us all in
LINE 132: singing, and music too."
LINE 133: Miss Wilson demurred.
LINE 134: "_She'll_ sing readily enough," said Fergus, "if you'll undertake to
LINE 135: stand by her, Mr. Lawrence, and turn over the leaves for her."
LINE 136: "I shall be most happy to do so, Miss Wilson; will you allow me?"
LINE 137: She bridled her long neck and smiled, and suffered him to lead her to
LINE 138: the instrument, where she played and sang, in her very best style, one
LINE 139: piece after another; while he stood patiently by, leaning one hand on
LINE 140: the back of her chair, and turning over the leaves of her book with the
LINE 141: other. Perhaps he was as much charmed with her performance as she was.
LINE 142: It was all very fine in its way; but I cannot say that it moved me very
LINE 143: deeply. There was plenty of skill and execution, but precious little
LINE 144: feeling.
LINE 145: But we had not done with Mrs. Graham yet.
LINE 146: "I don't take wine, Mrs. Markham," said Mr. Millward, upon the
LINE 147: introduction of that beverage; "I'll take a little of your home-brewed
LINE 148: ale. I always prefer your home-brewed to anything else."
LINE 149: Flattered at this compliment, my mother rang the bell, and a china jug
LINE 150: of our best ale was presently brought and set before the worthy
LINE 151: gentleman who so well knew how to appreciate its excellences.
LINE 152: "Now THIS is the thing!" cried he, pouring out a glass of the same in a
LINE 153: long stream, skilfully directed from the jug to the tumbler, so as to
LINE 154: produce much foam without spilling a drop; and, having surveyed it for
LINE 155: a moment opposite the candle, he took a deep draught, and then smacked
LINE 156: his lips, drew a long breath, and refilled his glass, my mother looking
LINE 157: on with the greatest satisfaction.
LINE 158: "There's nothing like this, Mrs. Markham!" said he. "I always maintain
LINE 159: that there's nothing to compare with your home-brewed ale."
LINE 160: "I'm sure I'm glad you like it, sir. I always look after the brewing
LINE 161: myself, as well as the cheese and the butter—I like to have things well
LINE 162: done, while we're about it."
LINE 163: "_Quite right_, Mrs. Markham!"
LINE 164: "But then, Mr. Millward, you don't think it _wrong_ to take a little
LINE 165: wine now and then—or a little spirits either!" said my mother, as she
LINE 166: handed a smoking tumbler of gin-and-water to Mrs. Wilson, who affirmed
LINE 167: that wine sat heavy on her stomach, and whose son Robert was at that
LINE 168: moment helping himself to a pretty stiff glass of the same.
LINE 169: "By no means!" replied the oracle, with a Jove-like nod; "these things
LINE 170: are all blessings and mercies, if we only knew how to make use of
LINE 171: them."
LINE 172: "But Mrs. Graham doesn't think so. You shall just hear now what she
LINE 173: told us the other day—I _told_ her I'd tell you."
LINE 174: And my mother favoured the company with a particular account of that
LINE 175: lady's mistaken ideas and conduct regarding the matter in hand,
LINE 176: concluding with, "Now, don't you think it is wrong?"
LINE 177: "Wrong!" repeated the vicar, with more than common solemnity—"criminal,
LINE 178: I should say—criminal! Not only is it making a fool of the boy, but it
LINE 179: is despising the gifts of Providence, and teaching him to trample them
LINE 180: under his feet."
LINE 181: He then entered more fully into the question, and explained at large
LINE 182: the folly and impiety of such a proceeding. My mother heard him with
LINE 183: profoundest reverence; and even Mrs. Wilson vouchsafed to rest her
LINE 184: tongue for a moment, and listen in silence, while she complacently
LINE 185: sipped her gin-and-water. Mr. Lawrence sat with his elbow on the table,
LINE 186: carelessly playing with his half-empty wine-glass, and covertly smiling
LINE 187: to himself.
LINE 188: "But don't you think, Mr. Millward," suggested he, when at length that
LINE 189: gentleman paused in his discourse, "that when a child may be naturally
LINE 190: prone to intemperance—by the fault of its parents or ancestors, for
LINE 191: instance—some precautions are advisable?" (Now it was generally
LINE 192: believed that Mr. Lawrence's father had shortened his days by
LINE 193: intemperance.)
LINE 194: "Some precautions, it may be; but temperance, sir, is one thing, and
LINE 195: abstinence another."
LINE 196: "But I have heard that, with some persons, temperance—that is,
LINE 197: moderation—is almost impossible; and if abstinence be an evil (which
LINE 198: some have doubted), no one will deny that excess is a greater. Some
LINE 199: parents have entirely prohibited their children from tasting
LINE 200: intoxicating liquors; but a parent's authority cannot last for ever;
LINE 201: children are naturally prone to hanker after forbidden things; and a
LINE 202: child, in such a case, would be likely to have a strong curiosity to
LINE 203: taste, and try the effect of what has been so lauded and enjoyed by
LINE 204: others, so strictly forbidden to himself—which curiosity would
LINE 205: generally be gratified on the first convenient opportunity; and the
LINE 206: restraint once broken, serious consequences might ensue. I don't
LINE 207: pretend to be a judge of such matters, but it seems to me, that this
LINE 208: plan of Mrs. Graham's, as you describe it, Mrs. Markham, extraordinary
LINE 209: as it may be, is not without its advantages; for here you see the child
LINE 210: is delivered at once from temptation; he has no secret curiosity, no
LINE 211: hankering desire; he is as well acquainted with the tempting liquors as
LINE 212: he ever wishes to be; and is thoroughly disgusted with them, without
LINE 213: having suffered from their effects."
LINE 214: "And is that right, sir? Have I not proven to you how wrong it is—how
LINE 215: contrary to Scripture and to reason, to teach a child to look with
LINE 216: contempt and disgust upon the blessings of Providence, instead of to
LINE 217: use them aright?"
LINE 218: "You may consider laudanum a blessing of Providence, sir," replied Mr.
LINE 219: Lawrence, smiling; "and yet, you will allow that most of us had better
LINE 220: abstain from it, even in moderation; but," added he, "I would not
LINE 221: desire you to follow out my simile too closely—in witness whereof I
LINE 222: finish my glass."
LINE 223: "And take another, I hope, Mr. Lawrence," said my mother, pushing the
LINE 224: bottle towards him.
LINE 225: He politely declined, and pushing his chair a little away from the
LINE 226: table, leant back towards me—I was seated a trifle behind, on the sofa
LINE 227: beside Eliza Millward—and carelessly asked me if I knew Mrs. Graham.
LINE 228: "I have met her once or twice," I replied.
LINE 229: "What do you think of her?"
LINE 230: "I cannot say that I like her much. She is handsome—or rather I should
LINE 231: say distinguished and interesting—in her appearance, but by no means
LINE 232: amiable—a woman liable to take strong prejudices, I should fancy, and
LINE 233: stick to them through thick and thin, twisting everything into
LINE 234: conformity with her own preconceived opinions—too hard, too sharp, too
LINE 235: bitter for my taste."
LINE 236: He made no reply, but looked down and bit his lip, and shortly after
LINE 237: rose and sauntered up to Miss Wilson, as much repelled by me, I fancy,
LINE 238: as attracted by her. I scarcely noticed it at the time, but afterwards
LINE 239: I was led to recall this and other trifling facts, of a similar nature,
LINE 240: to my remembrance, when—but I must not anticipate.
LINE 241: We wound up the evening with dancing—our worthy pastor thinking it no
LINE 242: scandal to be present on the occasion, though one of the village
LINE 243: musicians was engaged to direct our evolutions with his violin. But
LINE 244: Mary Millward obstinately refused to join us; and so did Richard
LINE 245: Wilson, though my mother earnestly entreated him to do so, and even
LINE 246: offered to be his partner.
LINE 247: We managed very well without them, however. With a single set of
LINE 248: quadrilles, and several country dances, we carried it on to a pretty
LINE 249: late hour; and at length, having called upon our musician to strike up
LINE 250: a waltz, I was just about to whirl Eliza round in that delightful
LINE 251: dance, accompanied by Lawrence and Jane Wilson, and Fergus and Rose,
LINE 252: when Mr. Millward interposed with:—"No, no; I don't allow that! Come,
LINE 253: it's time to be going now."
LINE 254: "Oh, no, papa!" pleaded Eliza.
LINE 255: "High time, my girl—high time! Moderation in all things, remember!
LINE 256: That's the plan—'Let your moderation be known unto all men!'"
LINE 257: But in revenge I followed Eliza into the dimly-lighted passage, where,
LINE 258: under pretence of helping her on with her shawl, I fear I must plead
LINE 259: guilty to snatching a kiss behind her father's back, while he was
LINE 260: enveloping his throat and chin in the folds of a mighty comforter. But
LINE 261: alas! in turning round, there was my mother close beside me. The
LINE 262: consequence was, that no sooner were the guests departed, than I was
LINE 263: doomed to a very serious remonstrance, which unpleasantly checked the
LINE 264: galloping course of my spirits, and made a disagreeable close to the
LINE 265: evening.
LINE 266: "My dear Gilbert," said she, "I wish you wouldn't do so! You know how
LINE 267: deeply I have your advantage at heart, how I love you and prize you
LINE 268: above everything else in the world, and how much I long to see you well
LINE 269: settled in life—and how bitterly it would grieve me to see you married
LINE 270: to that girl—or any other in the neighbourhood. What you _see_ in her I
LINE 271: don't know. It isn't only the want of money that I think about—nothing
LINE 272: of the kind—but there's neither beauty, nor cleverness, nor goodness,
LINE 273: nor anything else that's desirable. If you knew your own value, as I
LINE 274: do, you wouldn't dream of it. Do wait awhile and see! If you bind
LINE 275: yourself to her, you'll repent it all your lifetime when you look round
LINE 276: and see how many better there are. Take my word for it, you will."
LINE 277: "Well, mother, do be quiet!—I hate to be lectured!—I'm not going to
LINE 278: marry yet, I tell you; but—dear me! mayn't I enjoy myself at _all?_"
LINE 279: "Yes, my dear boy, but not in that way. Indeed, you shouldn't do such
LINE 280: things. You would be wronging the girl, if she were what she ought to
LINE 281: be; but I assure you she is as artful a little hussy as anybody need
LINE 282: wish to see; and you'll get entangled in her snares before you know
LINE 283: where you are. And if you _do_ marry her, Gilbert, you'll break my
LINE 284: heart—so there's an end of it."
LINE 285: "Well, don't cry about it, mother," said I, for the tears were gushing
LINE 286: from her eyes; "there, let that kiss efface the one I gave Eliza; don't
LINE 287: abuse her any more, and set your mind at rest; for I'll promise
LINE 288: never—that is, I'll promise to think twice before I take any important
LINE 289: step you seriously disapprove of."
LINE 290: So saying, I lighted my candle, and went to bed, considerably quenched
LINE 291: in spirit.
