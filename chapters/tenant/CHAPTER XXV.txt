LINE 1: On the eighth of April we went to London, on the eighth of May I
LINE 2: returned, in obedience to Arthur's wish; very much against my own,
LINE 3: because I left him behind. If he had come with me, I should have been
LINE 4: very glad to get home again, for he led me such a round of restless
LINE 5: dissipation while there, that, in that short space of time, I was quite
LINE 6: tired out. He seemed bent upon displaying me to his friends and
LINE 7: acquaintances in particular, and the public in general, on every
LINE 8: possible occasion, and to the greatest possible advantage. It was
LINE 9: something to feel that he considered me a worthy object of pride; but I
LINE 10: paid dear for the gratification: for, in the first place, to please him
LINE 11: I had to violate my cherished predilections, my almost rooted
LINE 12: principles in favour of a plain, dark, sober style of dress—I must
LINE 13: sparkle in costly jewels and deck myself out like a painted butterfly,
LINE 14: just as I had, long since, determined I would never do—and this was no
LINE 15: trifling sacrifice; in the second place, I was continually straining to
LINE 16: satisfy his sanguine expectations and do honour to his choice by my
LINE 17: general conduct and deportment, and fearing to disappoint him by some
LINE 18: awkward misdemeanour, or some trait of inexperienced ignorance about
LINE 19: the customs of society, especially when I acted the part of hostess,
LINE 20: which I was not unfrequently called upon to do; and, in the third
LINE 21: place, as I intimated before, I was wearied of the throng and bustle,
LINE 22: the restless hurry and ceaseless change of a life so alien to all my
LINE 23: previous habits. At last, he suddenly discovered that the London air
LINE 24: did not agree with me, and I was languishing for my country home, and
LINE 25: must immediately return to Grassdale.
LINE 26: I laughingly assured him that the case was not so urgent as he appeared
LINE 27: to think it, but I was quite willing to go home if he was. He replied
LINE 28: that he should be obliged to remain a week or two longer, as he had
LINE 29: business that required his presence.
LINE 30: [Illustration]
LINE 31: "Then I will stay with you," said I.
LINE 32: "But I can't do with you, Helen," was his answer: "as long as you stay
LINE 33: I shall attend to you and neglect my business."
LINE 34: "But I won't let you," I returned; "now that I know you have business
LINE 35: to attend to, I shall insist upon your attending to it, and letting me
LINE 36: alone; and, to tell the truth, I shall be glad of a little rest. I can
LINE 37: take my rides and walks in the Park as usual; and your business cannot
LINE 38: occupy all your time: I shall see you at meal-times, and in the
LINE 39: evenings at least, and that will be better than being leagues away and
LINE 40: never seeing you at all."
LINE 41: "But, my love, I cannot let you stay. How can I settle my affairs when
LINE 42: I know that you are here, neglected—?"
LINE 43: "I shall not feel myself neglected: while you are doing your duty,
LINE 44: Arthur, I shall never complain of neglect. If you had told me before,
LINE 45: that you had anything to do, it would have been half done before this;
LINE 46: and now you must make up for lost time by redoubled exertions. Tell me
LINE 47: what it is; and I will be your taskmaster, instead of being a
LINE 48: hindrance."
LINE 49: "No, no," persisted the impracticable creature; "you _must_ go home,
LINE 50: Helen; I must have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe and
LINE 51: well, though far away. Your bright eyes are faded, and that tender,
LINE 52: delicate bloom has quite deserted your cheek."
LINE 53: "That is only with too much gaiety and fatigue."
LINE 54: "It is not, I tell you; it is the London air: you are pining for the
LINE 55: fresh breezes of your country home, and you shall feel them before you
LINE 56: are two days older. And remember your situation, dearest Helen; on your
LINE 57: health, you know, depends the health, if not the life, of our future
LINE 58: hope."
LINE 59: "Then you really wish to get rid of me?"
LINE 60: "Positively, I do; and I will take you down myself to Grassdale, and
LINE 61: then return. I shall not be absent above a week or fortnight at most."
LINE 62: "But if I must go, I will go alone: if you must stay, it is needless to
LINE 63: waste your time in the journey there and back."
LINE 64: But he did not like the idea of sending me alone.
LINE 65: "Why, what helpless creature do you take me for," I replied, "that you
LINE 66: cannot trust me to go a hundred miles in our own carriage, with our own
LINE 67: footman and a maid to attend me? If you come with me I shall assuredly
LINE 68: keep you. But tell me, Arthur, what _is_ this tiresome business; and
LINE 69: why did you never mention it before?"
LINE 70: "It is only a little business with my lawyer," said he; and he told me
LINE 71: something about a piece of property he wanted to sell, in order to pay
LINE 72: off a part of the incumbrances on his estate; but either the account
LINE 73: was a little confused, or I was rather dull of comprehension, for I
LINE 74: could not clearly understand how that should keep him in town a
LINE 75: fortnight after me. Still less can I now comprehend how it should keep
LINE 76: him a month, for it is nearly that time since I left him, and no signs
LINE 77: of his return as yet. In every letter he promises to be with me in a
LINE 78: few days, and every time deceives me, or deceives himself. His excuses
LINE 79: are vague and insufficient. I cannot doubt that he has got among his
LINE 80: former companions again. Oh, why did I leave him! I wish—I do intensely
LINE 81: wish he would return!
LINE 82: June 29th.—No Arthur yet; and for many days I have been looking and
LINE 83: longing in vain for a letter. His letters, when they come, are kind, if
LINE 84: fair words and endearing epithets can give them a claim to the
LINE 85: title—but very short, and full of trivial excuses and promises that I
LINE 86: cannot trust; and yet how anxiously I look forward to them! how eagerly
LINE 87: I open and devour one of those little, hastily-scribbled returns for
LINE 88: the three or four long letters, hitherto unanswered, he has had from
LINE 89: me!
LINE 90: Oh, it is cruel to leave me so long alone! He knows I have no one but
LINE 91: Rachel to speak to, for we have no neighbours here, except the
LINE 92: Hargraves, whose residence I can dimly descry from these upper windows
LINE 93: embosomed among those low, woody hills beyond the Dale. I was glad when
LINE 94: I learnt that Milicent was so near us; and her company would be a
LINE 95: soothing solace to me now; but she is still in town with her mother;
LINE 96: there is no one at the Grove but little Esther and her French
LINE 97: governess, for Walter is always away. I saw that paragon of manly
LINE 98: perfections in London: he seemed scarcely to merit the eulogiums of his
LINE 99: mother and sister, though he certainly appeared more conversable and
LINE 100: agreeable than Lord Lowborough, more candid and high-minded than Mr.
LINE 101: Grimsby, and more polished and gentlemanly than Mr. Hattersley,
LINE 102: Arthur's only other friend whom he judged fit to introduce to me.—Oh,
LINE 103: Arthur, why won't you come? why won't you write to me at least? You
LINE 104: talked about my health: how can you expect me to gather bloom and
LINE 105: vigour here, pining in solitude and restless anxiety from day to
LINE 106: day?—It would serve you right to come back and find my good looks
LINE 107: entirely wasted away. I would beg my uncle and aunt, or my brother, to
LINE 108: come and see me, but I do not like to complain of my loneliness to
LINE 109: them, and indeed loneliness is the least of my sufferings. But what is
LINE 110: he doing—what is it that keeps him away? It is this ever-recurring
LINE 111: question, and the horrible suggestions it raises, that distract me.
LINE 112: July 3rd.—My last bitter letter has wrung from him an answer at last,
LINE 113: and a rather longer one than usual; but still I don't know what to make
LINE 114: of it. He playfully abuses me for the gall and vinegar of my latest
LINE 115: effusion, tells me I can have no conception of the multitudinous
LINE 116: engagements that keep him away, but avers that, in spite of them all,
LINE 117: he will assuredly be with me before the close of next week; though it
LINE 118: is impossible for a man so circumstanced as he is to fix the precise
LINE 119: day of his return: meantime he exhorts me to the exercise of patience,
LINE 120: "that first of woman's virtues," and desires me to remember the saying,
LINE 121: "Absence makes the heart grow fonder," and comfort myself with the
LINE 122: assurance that the longer he stays away the better he shall love me
LINE 123: when he returns; and till he does return, he begs I will continue to
LINE 124: write to him constantly, for, though he is sometimes too idle and often
LINE 125: too busy to answer my letters as they come, he likes to receive them
LINE 126: daily; and if I fulfil my threat of punishing his seeming neglect by
LINE 127: ceasing to write, he shall be so angry that he will do his utmost to
LINE 128: forget me. He adds this piece of intelligence respecting poor Milicent
LINE 129: Hargrave:
LINE 130: "Your little friend Milicent is likely, before long, to follow your
LINE 131: example, and take upon her the yoke of matrimony in conjunction with a
LINE 132: friend of mine. Hattersley, you know, has not yet fulfilled his direful
LINE 133: threat of throwing his precious person away on the first old maid that
LINE 134: chose to evince a tenderness for him; but he still preserves a resolute
LINE 135: determination to see himself a married man before the year is out.
LINE 136: 'Only,' said he to me, 'I must have somebody that will let me have my
LINE 137: own way in everything—not like _your_ wife, Huntingdon: she is a
LINE 138: charming creature, but she looks as if she had a will of her own, and
LINE 139: could play the vixen upon occasion' (I thought 'you're right there,
LINE 140: man,' but I didn't say so). 'I must have some good, quiet soul that
LINE 141: will let me just do what I like and go where I like, keep at home or
LINE 142: stay away, without a word of reproach or complaint; for I can't do with
LINE 143: being bothered.' 'Well,' said I, 'I know somebody that will suit you to
LINE 144: a tee, if you don't care for money, and that's Hargrave's sister,
LINE 145: Milicent.' He desired to be introduced to her forthwith, for he said he
LINE 146: had plenty of the needful himself, or should have when his old governor
LINE 147: chose to quit the stage. So you see, Helen, I have managed pretty well,
LINE 148: both for your friend and mine."
LINE 149: Poor Milicent! But I cannot imagine she will ever be led to accept such
LINE 150: a suitor—one so repugnant to all her ideas of a man to be honoured and
LINE 151: loved.
LINE 152: 5th.—Alas! I was mistaken. I have got a long letter from her this
LINE 153: morning, telling me she is already engaged, and expects to be married
LINE 154: before the close of the month.
LINE 155: "I hardly know what to say about it," she writes, "or what to think. To
LINE 156: tell you the truth, Helen, I don't like the thoughts of it at all. If I
LINE 157: _am_ to be Mr. Hattersley's wife, I must try to love him; and I do try
LINE 158: with all my might; but I have made very little progress yet; and the
LINE 159: worst symptom of the case is, that the further he is from me the better
LINE 160: I like him: he frightens me with his abrupt manners and strange
LINE 161: hectoring ways, and I dread the thoughts of marrying him. 'Then why
LINE 162: have you accepted him?' you will ask; and I didn't know I had accepted
LINE 163: him; but mamma tells me I have, and he seems to think so too. I
LINE 164: certainly didn't mean to do so; but I did not like to give him a flat
LINE 165: refusal, for fear mamma should be grieved and angry (for I knew she
LINE 166: wished me to marry him), and I wanted to talk to her first about it: so
LINE 167: I gave him what _I_ thought was an evasive, half negative answer; but
LINE 168: she says it was as good as an acceptance, and he would think me very
LINE 169: capricious if I were to attempt to draw back—and indeed I was so
LINE 170: confused and frightened at the moment, I can hardly tell what I said.
LINE 171: And next time I saw him, he accosted me in all confidence as his
LINE 172: affianced bride, and immediately began to settle matters with mamma. I
LINE 173: had not courage to contradict them then, and how can I do it now? I
LINE 174: cannot; they would think me mad. Besides, mamma is so delighted with
LINE 175: the idea of the match; she thinks she has managed so well for me; and I
LINE 176: cannot bear to disappoint her. I do object sometimes, and tell her what
LINE 177: I feel, but you don't know _how_ she talks. Mr. Hattersley, you know,
LINE 178: is the son of a rich banker, and as Esther and I have no fortunes, and
LINE 179: Walter very little, our dear mamma is very anxious to see us all well
LINE 180: married, that is, united to rich partners. It is not _my_ idea of being
LINE 181: well married, but she means it all for the best. She says when I am
LINE 182: safe off her hands it will be such a relief to her mind; and she
LINE 183: assures me it will be a good thing for the family as well as for me.
LINE 184: Even Walter is pleased at the prospect, and when I confessed my
LINE 185: reluctance to him, he said it was all childish nonsense. Do _you_ think
LINE 186: it nonsense, Helen? I should not care if I could see any prospect of
LINE 187: being able to love and admire him, but I can't. There is nothing about
LINE 188: him to hang one's esteem and affection upon; he is so diametrically
LINE 189: opposite to what I imagined my husband should be. Do write to me, and
LINE 190: say all you can to encourage me. Don't attempt to dissuade me, for my
LINE 191: fate is fixed: preparations for the important event are already going
LINE 192: on around me; and don't say a word against Mr. Hattersley, for I want
LINE 193: to think well of him; and though I have spoken against him myself, it
LINE 194: is for the last time: hereafter, I shall never permit myself to utter a
LINE 195: word in his dispraise, however he may seem to deserve it; and whoever
LINE 196: ventures to speak slightingly of the man I have promised to love, to
LINE 197: honour, and obey, must expect my serious displeasure. After all, I
LINE 198: think he is quite as good as Mr. Huntingdon, if not better; and yet you
LINE 199: love _him_, and seem to be happy and contented; and perhaps I may
LINE 200: manage as well. You must tell me, if you can, that Mr. Hattersley is
LINE 201: better than he seems—that he is upright, honourable, and
LINE 202: open-hearted—in fact, a perfect diamond in the rough. He may be all
LINE 203: this, but I don't know him. I know only the exterior, and what, I
LINE 204: trust, is the worst part of him."
LINE 205: She concludes with "Good-by, dear Helen. I am waiting anxiously for
LINE 206: your advice—but mind you let it be all on the right side."
LINE 207: Alas! poor Milicent, what encouragement can I give you? or what
LINE 208: advice—except that it is better to make a bold stand now, though at the
LINE 209: expense of disappointing and angering both mother and brother and
LINE 210: lover, than to devote your whole life, hereafter, to misery and vain
LINE 211: regret?
LINE 212: Saturday, 13th.—The week is over, and he is not come. All the sweet
LINE 213: summer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or benefit
LINE 214: to him. And I had all along been looking forward to this season with
LINE 215: the fond, delusive hope that we should enjoy it so sweetly together;
LINE 216: and that, with God's help and my exertions, it would be the means of
LINE 217: elevating his mind, and refining his taste to a due appreciation of the
LINE 218: salutary and pure delights of nature, and peace, and holy love. But
LINE 219: now—at evening, when I see the round red sun sink quietly down behind
LINE 220: those woody hills, leaving them sleeping in a warm, red, golden haze, I
LINE 221: only think another lovely day is lost to him and me; and at morning,
LINE 222: when roused by the flutter and chirp of the sparrows, and the gleeful
LINE 223: twitter of the swallows—all intent upon feeding their young, and full
LINE 224: of life and joy in their own little frames—I open the window to inhale
LINE 225: the balmy, soul-reviving air, and look out upon the lovely landscape,
LINE 226: laughing in dew and sunshine—I too often shame that glorious scene with
LINE 227: tears of thankless misery, because _he_ cannot feel its freshening
LINE 228: influence; and when I wander in the ancient woods, and meet the little
LINE 229: wild flowers smiling in my path, or sit in the shadow of our noble
LINE 230: ash-trees by the water-side, with their branches gently swaying in the
LINE 231: light summer breeze that murmurs through their feathery foliage—my ears
LINE 232: full of that low music mingled with the dreamy hum of insects, my eyes
LINE 233: abstractedly gazing on the glassy surface of the little lake before me,
LINE 234: with the trees that crowd about its bank, some gracefully bending to
LINE 235: kiss its waters, some rearing their stately heads high above, but
LINE 236: stretching their wide arms over its margin, all faithfully mirrored
LINE 237: far, far down in its glassy depth—though sometimes the images are
LINE 238: partially broken by the sport of aquatic insects, and sometimes, for a
LINE 239: moment, the whole is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient
LINE 240: breeze that sweeps the surface too roughly—still I have no pleasure;
LINE 241: for the greater the happiness that nature sets before me, the more I
LINE 242: lament that _he_ is not here to taste it: the greater the bliss we
LINE 243: might enjoy together, the more I feel our present wretchedness apart
LINE 244: (yes, ours; he must be wretched, though he may not know it); and the
LINE 245: more my senses are pleased, the more my heart is oppressed; for he
LINE 246: keeps it with him confined amid the dust and smoke of London—perhaps
LINE 247: shut up within the walls of his own abominable club.
LINE 248: But most of all, at night, when I enter my lonely chamber, and look out
LINE 249: upon the summer moon, "sweet regent of the sky," floating above me in
LINE 250: the "black blue vault of heaven," shedding a flood of silver radiance
LINE 251: over park, and wood, and water, so pure, so peaceful, so divine—and
LINE 252: think, Where is he now?—what is he doing at this moment? wholly
LINE 253: unconscious of this heavenly scene—perhaps revelling with his boon
LINE 254: companions, perhaps—God help me, it is too—_too_ much!
LINE 255: 23rd.—Thank heaven, he is come at last! But how altered! flushed and
LINE 256: feverish, listless and languid, his beauty strangely diminished, his
LINE 257: vigour and vivacity quite departed. I have not upbraided him by word or
LINE 258: look; I have not even asked him what he has been doing. I have not the
LINE 259: heart to do it, for I think he is ashamed of himself—he must be so
LINE 260: indeed, and such inquiries could not fail to be painful to both. My
LINE 261: forbearance pleases him—touches him even, I am inclined to think. He
LINE 262: says he is glad to be home again, and God knows how glad I am to get
LINE 263: him back, even as he is. He lies on the sofa, nearly all day long; and
LINE 264: I play and sing to him for hours together. I write his letters for him,
LINE 265: and get him everything he wants; and sometimes I read to him, and
LINE 266: sometimes I talk, and sometimes only sit by him and soothe him with
LINE 267: silent caresses. I know he does not deserve it; and I fear I am
LINE 268: spoiling him; but this once, I will forgive him, freely and entirely. I
LINE 269: will shame him into virtue if I can, and I will never let him leave me
LINE 270: again.
LINE 271: He is pleased with my attentions—it may be, grateful for them. He likes
LINE 272: to have me near him: and though he is peevish and testy with his
LINE 273: servants and his dogs, he is gentle and kind to me. What he would be,
LINE 274: if I did not so watchfully anticipate his wants, and so carefully
LINE 275: avoid, or immediately desist from doing anything that has a tendency to
LINE 276: irritate or disturb him, with however little reason, I cannot tell. How
LINE 277: intensely I wish he were worthy of all this care! Last night, as I sat
LINE 278: beside him, with his head in my lap, passing my fingers through his
LINE 279: beautiful curls, this thought made my eyes overflow with sorrowful
LINE 280: tears—as it often does; but this time, a tear fell on his face and made
LINE 281: him look up. He smiled, but not insultingly.
LINE 282: "Dear Helen!" he said—"why do you cry? you know that I love you" (and
LINE 283: he pressed my hand to his feverish lips), "and what more could you
LINE 284: desire?"
LINE 285: "Only, Arthur, that you would love _yourself_ as truly and as
LINE 286: faithfully as you are loved by me."
LINE 287: "That would be hard, indeed!" he replied, tenderly squeezing my hand.
LINE 288: August 24th.—Arthur is himself again, as lusty and reckless, as light
LINE 289: of heart and head as ever, and as restless and hard to amuse as a
LINE 290: spoilt child, and almost as full of mischief too, especially when wet
LINE 291: weather keeps him within doors. I wish he had something to do, some
LINE 292: useful trade, or profession, or employment—anything to occupy his head
LINE 293: or his hands for a few hours a day, and give him something besides his
LINE 294: own pleasure to think about. If he would play the country gentleman and
LINE 295: attend to the farm—but that he knows nothing about, and won't give his
LINE 296: mind to consider,—or if he would take up with some literary study, or
LINE 297: learn to draw or to play—as he is so fond of music, I often try to
LINE 298: persuade him to learn the piano, but he is far too idle for such an
LINE 299: undertaking: he has no more idea of exerting himself to overcome
LINE 300: obstacles than he has of restraining his natural appetites; and these
LINE 301: two things are the ruin of him. I lay them both to the charge of his
LINE 302: harsh yet careless father, and his madly indulgent mother.—If ever I am
LINE 303: a mother I will zealously strive against this _crime_ of
LINE 304: over-indulgence. I can hardly give it a milder name when I think of the
LINE 305: evils it brings.
LINE 306: Happily, it will soon be the shooting season, and then, if the weather
LINE 307: permit, he will find occupation enough in the pursuit and destruction
LINE 308: of the partridges and pheasants: we have no grouse, or he might have
LINE 309: been similarly occupied at this moment, instead of lying under the
LINE 310: acacia-tree pulling poor Dash's ears. But he says it is dull work
LINE 311: shooting alone; he must have a friend or two to help him.
LINE 312: "Let them be tolerably decent then, Arthur," said I. The word "friend"
LINE 313: in his mouth makes me shudder: I know it was some of his "friends" that
LINE 314: induced him to stay behind me in London, and kept him away so long:
LINE 315: indeed, from what he has unguardedly told me, or hinted from time to
LINE 316: time, I cannot doubt that he frequently showed them my letters, to let
LINE 317: them see how fondly his wife watched over his interests, and how keenly
LINE 318: she regretted his absence; and that they induced him to remain week
LINE 319: after week, and to plunge into all manner of excesses, to avoid being
LINE 320: laughed at for a wife-ridden fool, and, perhaps, to show how far he
LINE 321: could venture to go without danger of shaking the fond creature's
LINE 322: devoted attachment. It is a hateful idea, but I cannot believe it is a
LINE 323: false one.
LINE 324: "Well," replied he, "I thought of Lord Lowborough for one; but there is
LINE 325: no possibility of getting him without his better half, our mutual
LINE 326: friend, Annabella; so we must ask them both. You're not afraid of her,
LINE 327: are you, Helen?" he asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
LINE 328: "Of course not," I answered: "why should I? And who besides?"
LINE 329: "Hargrave for one. He will be glad to come, though his own place is so
LINE 330: near, for he has little enough land of his own to shoot over, and we
LINE 331: can extend our depredations into it, if we like; and he is thoroughly
LINE 332: respectable, you know, Helen—quite a lady's man: and I think, Grimsby
LINE 333: for another: he's a decent, quiet fellow enough. You'll not object to
LINE 334: Grimsby?"
LINE 335: "I hate him: but, however, if you wish it, I'll try to endure his
LINE 336: presence for a while."
LINE 337: "All a prejudice, Helen, a mere woman's antipathy."
LINE 338: "No; I have solid grounds for my dislike. And is that all?"
LINE 339: "Why, yes, I think so. Hattersley will be too busy billing and cooing,
LINE 340: with his bride to have much time to spare for guns and dogs at
LINE 341: present," he replied. And that reminds me, that I have had several
LINE 342: letters from Milicent since her marriage, and that she either is, or
LINE 343: pretends to be, quite reconciled to her lot. She professes to have
LINE 344: discovered numberless virtues and perfections in her husband, some of
LINE 345: which, I fear, less partial eyes would fail to distinguish, though they
LINE 346: sought them carefully with tears; and now that she is accustomed to his
LINE 347: loud voice, and abrupt, uncourteous manners, she affirms she finds no
LINE 348: difficulty in loving him as a wife should do, and begs I will burn that
LINE 349: letter wherein she spoke so unadvisedly against him. So that I trust
LINE 350: she may yet be happy; but, if she is, it will be entirely the reward of
LINE 351: her own goodness of heart; for had she chosen to consider herself the
LINE 352: victim of fate, or of her mother's worldly wisdom, she might have been
LINE 353: thoroughly miserable; and if, for duty's sake, she had not made every
LINE 354: effort to love her husband, she would, doubtless, have hated him to the
LINE 355: end of her days.
