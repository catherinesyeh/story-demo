LINE 1: Evening.—Breakfast passed well over: I was calm and cool throughout. I
LINE 2: answered composedly all inquiries respecting my health; and whatever
LINE 3: was unusual in my look or manner was generally attributed to the
LINE 4: trifling indisposition that had occasioned my early retirement last
LINE 5: night. But how am I to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet
LINE 6: elapse before they go? Yet why so long for their departure? When they
LINE 7: _are_ gone, how shall I get through the months or years of my future
LINE 8: life in company with that man—my greatest enemy? for none could injure
LINE 9: me as he has done. Oh! when I think how fondly, how foolishly I have
LINE 10: loved him, how madly I have trusted him, how constantly I have
LINE 11: laboured, and studied, and prayed, and struggled for his advantage; and
LINE 12: how cruelly he has trampled on my love, betrayed my trust, scorned my
LINE 13: prayers and tears, and efforts for his preservation, crushed my hopes,
LINE 14: destroyed my youth's best feelings, and doomed me to a life of hopeless
LINE 15: misery, as far as man can do it, it is not enough to say that I no
LINE 16: longer love my husband—I HATE him! The word stares me in the face like
LINE 17: a guilty confession, but it is true: I hate him—I hate him! But God
LINE 18: have mercy on his miserable soul! and make him see and feel his guilt—I
LINE 19: ask no other vengeance! If he could but fully know and truly feel my
LINE 20: wrongs I should be well avenged, and I could freely pardon all; but he
LINE 21: is so lost, so hardened in his heartless depravity, that in this life I
LINE 22: believe he never will. But it is useless dwelling on this theme: let me
LINE 23: seek once more to dissipate reflection in the minor details of passing
LINE 24: events.
LINE 25: Mr. Hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his serious,
LINE 26: sympathising, and (as _he_ thinks) unobtrusive politeness. If it were
LINE 27: more obtrusive it would trouble me less, for then I could snub him;
LINE 28: but, as it is, he contrives to appear so really kind and thoughtful
LINE 29: that I cannot do so without rudeness and seeming ingratitude. I
LINE 30: sometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he
LINE 31: simulates so well; and then again, I think it is my _duty_ to suspect
LINE 32: him under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed. His kindness
LINE 33: may not all be feigned; but still, let not the purest impulse of
LINE 34: gratitude to him induce me to forget myself: let me remember the game
LINE 35: of chess, the expressions he used on the occasion, and those
LINE 36: indescribable looks of his, that so justly roused my indignation, and I
LINE 37: think I shall be safe enough. I have done well to record them so
LINE 38: minutely.
LINE 39: I think he wishes to find an opportunity of speaking to me alone: he
LINE 40: has seemed to be on the watch all day; but I have taken care to
LINE 41: disappoint him—not that I fear anything he could say, but I have
LINE 42: trouble enough without the addition of his insulting consolations,
LINE 43: condolences, or whatever else he might attempt; and, for Milicent's
LINE 44: sake, I do not wish to quarrel with him. He excused himself from going
LINE 45: out to shoot with the other gentlemen in the morning, under the pretext
LINE 46: of having letters to write; and instead of retiring for that purpose
LINE 47: into the library, he sent for his desk into the morning-room, where I
LINE 48: was seated with Milicent and Lady Lowborough. They had betaken
LINE 49: themselves to their work; I, less to divert my mind than to deprecate
LINE 50: conversation, had provided myself with a book. Milicent saw that I
LINE 51: wished to be quiet, and accordingly let me alone. Annabella, doubtless,
LINE 52: saw it too: but that was no reason why she should restrain her tongue,
LINE 53: or curb her cheerful spirits: _she_ accordingly chatted away,
LINE 54: addressing herself almost exclusively to me, and with the utmost
LINE 55: assurance and familiarity, growing the more animated and friendly the
LINE 56: colder and briefer my answers became. Mr. Hargrave saw that I could ill
LINE 57: endure it, and, looking up from his desk, he answered her questions and
LINE 58: observations for me, as far as he could, and attempted to transfer her
LINE 59: social attentions from me to himself; but it would not do. Perhaps she
LINE 60: thought I had a headache, and could not bear to talk; at any rate, she
LINE 61: saw that her loquacious vivacity annoyed me, as I could tell by the
LINE 62: malicious pertinacity with which she persisted. But I checked it
LINE 63: effectually by putting into her hand the book I had been trying to
LINE 64: read, on the fly-leaf of which I had hastily scribbled,—
LINE 65: "I am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any
LINE 66: real friendship for you, and as I am without your talent for
LINE 67: dissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it. I must, therefore,
LINE 68: beg that hereafter all familiar intercourse may cease between us; and
LINE 69: if I still continue to treat you with civility, as if you were a woman
LINE 70: worthy of consideration and respect, understand that it is out of
LINE 71: regard for your cousin Milicent's feelings, not for yours."
LINE 72: Upon perusing this she turned scarlet, and bit her lip. Covertly
LINE 73: tearing away the leaf, she crumpled it up and put it in the fire, and
LINE 74: then employed herself in turning over the pages of the book, and,
LINE 75: really or apparently, perusing its contents. In a little while Milicent
LINE 76: announced it her intention to repair to the nursery, and asked if I
LINE 77: would accompany her.
LINE 78: "Annabella will excuse us," said she; "she's busy reading."
LINE 79: "No, I won't," cried Annabella, suddenly looking up, and throwing her
LINE 80: book on the table; "I want to speak to Helen a minute. You may go,
LINE 81: Milicent, and she'll follow in a while." (Milicent went.) "Will you
LINE 82: oblige me, Helen?" continued she.
LINE 83: Her impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the
LINE 84: library. She closed the door, and walked up to the fire.
LINE 85: "Who told you this?" said she.
LINE 86: "No one: I am not incapable of seeing for myself."
LINE 87: "Ah, you are suspicious!" cried she, smiling, with a gleam of hope.
LINE 88: Hitherto there had been a kind of desperation in her hardihood; now she
LINE 89: was evidently relieved.
LINE 90: "If I _were_ suspicious," I replied, "I should have discovered your
LINE 91: infamy long before. No, Lady Lowborough, I do not found my charge upon
LINE 92: suspicion."
LINE 93: "On what _do_ you found it, then?" said she, throwing herself into an
LINE 94: arm-chair, and stretching out her feet to the fender, with an obvious
LINE 95: effort to appear composed.
LINE 96: "I enjoy a moonlight ramble as well as you," I answered, steadily
LINE 97: fixing my eyes upon her; "and the shrubbery happens to be one of my
LINE 98: favourite resorts."
LINE 99: She coloured again excessively, and remained silent, pressing her
LINE 100: finger against her teeth, and gazing into the fire. I watched her a few
LINE 101: moments with a feeling of malevolent gratification; then, moving
LINE 102: towards the door, I calmly asked if she had anything more to say.
LINE 103: "Yes, yes!" cried she eagerly, starting up from her reclining posture.
LINE 104: "I want to know if you will tell Lord Lowborough?"
LINE 105: "Suppose I do?"
LINE 106: "Well, if you are disposed to publish the matter, _I_ cannot dissuade
LINE 107: you, of course—but there will be terrible work if you do—and if you
LINE 108: don't, I shall think you the most generous of mortal beings—and if
LINE 109: there is anything in the world I can do for you—anything short of—" she
LINE 110: hesitated.
LINE 111: "Short of renouncing your guilty connection with my husband, I suppose
LINE 112: you mean?" said I.
LINE 113: She paused, in evident disconcertion and perplexity, mingled with anger
LINE 114: she dared not show.
LINE 115: "I cannot renounce what is dearer than life," she muttered, in a low,
LINE 116: hurried tone. Then, suddenly raising her head and fixing her gleaming
LINE 117: eyes upon me, she continued earnestly: "But, Helen—or Mrs. Huntingdon,
LINE 118: or whatever you would have me call you—_will_ you tell him? If you are
LINE 119: generous, here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your
LINE 120: magnanimity: if you are proud, here am I—your rival—ready to
LINE 121: acknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble
LINE 122: forbearance."
LINE 123: "I shall not tell him."
LINE 124: "You will not!" cried she, delightedly. "Accept my sincere thanks,
LINE 125: then!"
LINE 126: She sprang up, and offered me her hand. I drew back.
LINE 127: "Give me no thanks; it is not for _your_ sake that I refrain. Neither
LINE 128: is it an act of any forbearance: I have no wish to publish your shame.
LINE 129: I should be sorry to distress your husband with the knowledge of it."
LINE 130: "And Milicent? will you tell her?"
LINE 131: "No: on the contrary, I shall do my utmost to conceal it from her. I
LINE 132: would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her
LINE 133: relation!"
LINE 134: "You use hard words, Mrs. Huntingdon, but I can pardon you."
LINE 135: "And now, Lady Lowborough," continued I, "let me counsel you to leave
LINE 136: this house as soon as _possible_. You must be aware that your
LINE 137: continuance here is excessively disagreeable to me—not for Mr.
LINE 138: Huntingdon's sake," said I, observing the dawn of a malicious smile of
LINE 139: triumph on her face—"you are welcome to him, if you like him, as far as
LINE 140: _I_ am concerned—but because it is painful to be always disguising my
LINE 141: true sentiments respecting you, and straining to keep up an appearance
LINE 142: of civility and respect towards one for whom I have not the most
LINE 143: distant shadow of esteem; and because, if you stay, your conduct cannot
LINE 144: possibly remain concealed much longer from the only two persons in the
LINE 145: house who do not know it already. And, for your husband's sake,
LINE 146: Annabella, and even for your own, I wish—I earnestly advise and
LINE 147: _entreat_ you to break off this unlawful connection at once, and return
LINE 148: to your duty while you may, before the dreadful consequences—"
LINE 149: "Yes, yes, of course," said she, interrupting me with a gesture of
LINE 150: impatience. "But I cannot go, Helen, before the time appointed for our
LINE 151: departure. What possible pretext could I frame for such a thing?
LINE 152: Whether I proposed going back alone—which Lowborough would not hear
LINE 153: of—or taking him with me, the very circumstance itself would be certain
LINE 154: to excite suspicion—and when our visit is so _nearly_ at an end
LINE 155: too—little more than a week—surely you can endure my presence _so_
LINE 156: long! I will not annoy you with any more of my friendly impertinences."
LINE 157: "Well, I have nothing more to say to you."
LINE 158: "Have you mentioned this affair to Huntingdon?" asked she, as I was
LINE 159: leaving the room.
LINE 160: "How dare you mention his name to me!" was the only answer I gave.
LINE 161: No words have passed between us since, but such as outward decency or
LINE 162: pure necessity demanded.
