LINE 1: My greatest source of uneasiness, in this time of trial, was my son,
LINE 2: whom his father and his father's friends delighted to encourage in all
LINE 3: the embryo vices a little child can show, and to instruct in all the
LINE 4: evil habits he could acquire—in a word, to "make a man of him" was one
LINE 5: of their staple amusements; and I need say no more to justify my alarm
LINE 6: on his account, and my determination to deliver him at any hazard from
LINE 7: the hands of such instructors. I first attempted to keep him always
LINE 8: with me, or in the nursery, and gave Rachel particular injunctions
LINE 9: never to let him come down to dessert as long as these "gentlemen"
LINE 10: stayed; but it was no use: these orders were immediately countermanded
LINE 11: and overruled by his father; he was not going to have the little fellow
LINE 12: moped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of a mother. So
LINE 13: the little fellow came down every evening in spite of his cross mamma,
LINE 14: and learned to tipple wine like papa, to swear like Mr. Hattersley, and
LINE 15: to have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the devil when she
LINE 16: tried to prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish naïveté
LINE 17: of that pretty little child, and hear such things spoken by that small
LINE 18: infantile voice, was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to
LINE 19: them as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me; and when he
LINE 20: had set the table in a roar he would look round delightedly upon them
LINE 21: all, and add his shrill laugh to theirs. But if that beaming blue eye
LINE 22: rested on me, its light would vanish for a moment, and he would say, in
LINE 23: some concern, "Mamma, why don't _you_ laugh? Make her laugh, papa—she
LINE 24: never will."
LINE 25: Hence was I obliged to stay among these human brutes, watching an
LINE 26: opportunity to get my child away from them instead of leaving them
LINE 27: immediately after the removal of the cloth, as I should always
LINE 28: otherwise have done. He was never willing to go, and I frequently had
LINE 29: to carry him away by force, for which he thought me very cruel and
LINE 30: unjust; and sometimes his father would insist upon my letting him
LINE 31: remain; and then I would leave him to his kind friends, and retire to
LINE 32: indulge my bitterness and despair alone, or to rack my brains for a
LINE 33: remedy to this great evil.
LINE 34: But here again I must do Mr. Hargrave the justice to acknowledge that I
LINE 35: never saw _him_ laugh at the child's misdemeanours, nor heard him utter
LINE 36: a word of encouragement to his aspirations after manly accomplishments.
LINE 37: But when anything very extraordinary was said or done by the infant
LINE 38: profligate, I noticed, at times, a peculiar expression in his face that
LINE 39: I could neither interpret nor define: a slight twitching about the
LINE 40: muscles of the mouth; a sudden flash in the eye, as he darted a sudden
LINE 41: glance at the child and then at me: and then I could fancy there arose
LINE 42: a gleam of hard, keen, sombre satisfaction in his countenance at the
LINE 43: look of impotent wrath and anguish he was too certain to behold in
LINE 44: mine. But on one occasion, when Arthur had been behaving particularly
LINE 45: ill, and Mr. Huntingdon and his guests had been particularly provoking
LINE 46: and insulting to me in their encouragement of him, and I particularly
LINE 47: anxious to get him out of the room, and on the very point of demeaning
LINE 48: myself by a burst of uncontrollable passion—Mr. Hargrave suddenly rose
LINE 49: from his seat with an aspect of stern determination, lifted the child
LINE 50: from his father's knee, where he was sitting half-tipsy, cocking his
LINE 51: head and laughing at me, and execrating me with words he little knew
LINE 52: the meaning of, handed him out of the room, and, setting him down in
LINE 53: the hall, held the door open for me, gravely bowed as I withdrew, and
LINE 54: closed it after me. I heard high words exchanged between him and his
LINE 55: already half-inebriated host as I departed, leading away my bewildered
LINE 56: and disconcerted boy.
LINE 57: But this should not continue: my child must not be abandoned to this
LINE 58: corruption: better far that he should live in poverty and obscurity,
LINE 59: with a fugitive mother, than in luxury and affluence with such a
LINE 60: father. These guests might not be with us long, but they would return
LINE 61: again: and he, the most injurious of the whole, his child's worst
LINE 62: enemy, would still remain. I could endure it for myself, but for my son
LINE 63: it must be borne no longer: the world's opinion and the feelings of my
LINE 64: friends must be alike unheeded here, at least—alike unable to deter me
LINE 65: from my duty. But where should I find an asylum, and how obtain
LINE 66: subsistence for us both? Oh, I would take my precious charge at early
LINE 67: dawn, take the coach to M——, flee to the port of ——, cross the
LINE 68: Atlantic, and seek a quiet, humble home in New England, where I would
LINE 69: support myself and him by the labour of my hands. The palette and the
LINE 70: easel, my darling playmates once, must be my sober toil-fellows now.
LINE 71: But was I sufficiently skilful as an artist to obtain my livelihood in
LINE 72: a strange land, without friends and without recommendation? No; I must
LINE 73: wait a little; I must labour hard to improve my talent, and to produce
LINE 74: something worth while as a specimen of my powers, something to speak
LINE 75: favourably for me, whether as an actual painter or a teacher. Brilliant
LINE 76: success, of course, I did not look for, but some degree of security
LINE 77: from positive failure was indispensable: I must not take my son to
LINE 78: starve. And then I must have money for the journey, the passage, and
LINE 79: some little to support us in our retreat in case I should be
LINE 80: unsuccessful at first: and not too little either: for who could tell
LINE 81: how long I might have to struggle with the indifference or neglect of
LINE 82: others, or my own inexperience or inability to suit their tastes?
LINE 83: What should I do then? Apply to my brother and explain my circumstances
LINE 84: and my resolves to him? No, no: even if I told him _all_ my grievances,
LINE 85: which I should be very reluctant to do, he would be certain to
LINE 86: disapprove of the step: it would seem like madness to him, as it would
LINE 87: to my uncle and aunt, or to Milicent. No; I must have patience and
LINE 88: gather a hoard of my own. Rachel should be my only confidante—I thought
LINE 89: I could persuade her into the scheme; and she should help me, first, to
LINE 90: find out a picture-dealer in some distant town; then, through her
LINE 91: means, I would privately sell what pictures I had on hand that would do
LINE 92: for such a purpose, and some of those I should thereafter paint.
LINE 93: Besides this, I would contrive to dispose of my jewels, not the family
LINE 94: jewels, but the few I brought with me from home, and those my uncle
LINE 95: gave me on my marriage. A few months' arduous toil might well be borne
LINE 96: by me with such an end in view; and in the interim my son could not be
LINE 97: much more injured than he was already.
LINE 98: Having formed this resolution, I immediately set to work to accomplish
LINE 99: it, I might possibly have been induced to wax cool upon it afterwards,
LINE 100: or perhaps to keep weighing the pros and cons in my mind till the
LINE 101: latter overbalanced the former, and I was driven to relinquish the
LINE 102: project altogether, or delay the execution of it to an indefinite
LINE 103: period, had not something occurred to confirm me in that determination,
LINE 104: to which I still adhere, which I still think I did well to form, and
LINE 105: shall do better to execute.
LINE 106: Since Lord Lowborough's departure I had regarded the library as
LINE 107: entirely my own, a secure retreat at all hours of the day. None of our
LINE 108: gentlemen had the smallest pretensions to a literary taste, except Mr.
LINE 109: Hargrave; and he, at present, was quite contented with the newspapers
LINE 110: and periodicals of the day. And if, by any chance, he should look in
LINE 111: here, I felt assured he would soon depart on seeing me, for, instead of
LINE 112: becoming less cool and distant towards me, he had become decidedly more
LINE 113: so since the departure of his mother and sisters, which was just what I
LINE 114: wished. Here, then, I set up my easel, and here I worked at my canvas
LINE 115: from daylight till dusk, with very little intermission, saving when
LINE 116: pure necessity, or my duties to little Arthur, called me away: for I
LINE 117: still thought proper to devote some portion of every day exclusively to
LINE 118: his instruction and amusement. But, contrary to my expectation, on the
LINE 119: third morning, while I was thus employed, Mr. Hargrave _did_ look in,
LINE 120: and did _not_ immediately withdraw on seeing me. He apologized for his
LINE 121: intrusion, and said he was only come for a book; but when he had got
LINE 122: it, he condescended to cast a glance over my picture. Being a man of
LINE 123: taste, he had something to say on this subject as well as another, and
LINE 124: having modestly commented on it, without much encouragement from me, he
LINE 125: proceeded to expatiate on the art in general. Receiving no
LINE 126: encouragement in that either, he dropped it, but did not depart.
LINE 127: "You don't give us much of your company, Mrs. Huntingdon," observed he,
LINE 128: after a brief pause, during which I went on coolly mixing and tempering
LINE 129: my colours; "and I cannot wonder at it, for you must be heartily sick
LINE 130: of us all. I myself am so thoroughly ashamed of my companions, and so
LINE 131: weary of their irrational conversation and pursuits—now that there is
LINE 132: no one to humanize them and keep them in check, since you have justly
LINE 133: abandoned us to our own devices—that I think I shall presently withdraw
LINE 134: from amongst them, probably within this week; and I cannot suppose you
LINE 135: will regret my departure."
LINE 136: He paused. I did not answer.
LINE 137: "Probably," he added, with a smile, "your only regret on the subject
LINE 138: will be that I do not take all my companions along with me. I flatter
LINE 139: myself, at times, that though among them I am not of them; but it is
LINE 140: natural that you should be glad to get rid of me. I may regret this,
LINE 141: but I cannot blame you for it."
LINE 142: "I shall not rejoice at _your_ departure, for you _can_ conduct
LINE 143: yourself like a gentleman," said I, thinking it but right to make some
LINE 144: acknowledgment for his good behaviour; "but I must confess I shall
LINE 145: rejoice to bid adieu to the rest, inhospitable as it may appear."
LINE 146: "No one can blame you for such an avowal," replied he gravely: "not
LINE 147: even the gentlemen themselves, I imagine. I'll just tell you," he
LINE 148: continued, as if actuated by a sudden resolution, "what was said last
LINE 149: night in the dining-room, after you left us: perhaps you will not mind
LINE 150: it, as you're so _very_ philosophical on certain points," he added with
LINE 151: a slight sneer. "They were talking about Lord Lowborough and his
LINE 152: delectable lady, the cause of whose sudden departure is no secret
LINE 153: amongst them; and her character is so well known to them all, that,
LINE 154: nearly related to me as she is, I could not attempt to defend it. Curse
LINE 155: me!" he muttered, _par parenthése_, "if I don't have vengeance for
LINE 156: this! If the villain must disgrace the family, must he blazon it abroad
LINE 157: to every low-bred knave of his acquaintance? I beg your pardon, Mrs.
LINE 158: Huntingdon. Well, they were talking of these things, and some of them
LINE 159: remarked that, as she was separated from her husband, he might see her
LINE 160: again when he pleased."
LINE 161: "'Thank you,' said he; 'I've had enough of her for the present: I'll
LINE 162: not trouble to see her, unless she comes to me.'
LINE 163: "'Then what do you mean to do, Huntingdon, when we're gone?' said Ralph
LINE 164: Hattersley. 'Do you mean to turn from the error of your ways, and be a
LINE 165: good husband, a good father, and so forth; as I do, when I get shut of
LINE 166: you and all these rollicking devils you call your friends? I think it's
LINE 167: time; and your wife is fifty times too good for you, you _know_—'
LINE 168: "And he added some praise of you, which you would not thank me for
LINE 169: repeating, nor him for uttering; proclaiming it aloud, as he did,
LINE 170: without delicacy or discrimination, in an audience where it seemed
LINE 171: profanation to utter your name: himself utterly incapable of
LINE 172: understanding or appreciating your real excellences. Huntingdon,
LINE 173: meanwhile, sat quietly drinking his wine,—or looking smilingly into his
LINE 174: glass and offering no interruption or reply, till Hattersley shouted
LINE 175: out,—'Do you hear me, man?'
LINE 176: "'Yes, go on,' said he.
LINE 177: "'Nay, I've done,' replied the other: 'I only want to know if you
LINE 178: intend to take my advice.'
LINE 179: "'What advice?'
LINE 180: "'To turn over a new leaf, you double-dyed scoundrel,' shouted Ralph,
LINE 181: 'and beg your wife's pardon, and be a good boy for the future.'
LINE 182: "'My wife! what wife? I have no wife,' replied Huntingdon, looking
LINE 183: innocently up from his glass, 'or if I have, look you, gentlemen: I
LINE 184: value her so highly that any one among you, that can fancy her, may
LINE 185: have her and welcome: you may, by Jove, and my blessing into the
LINE 186: bargain!'
LINE 187: "I—hem—someone asked if he really meant what he said; upon which he
LINE 188: solemnly swore he did, and no mistake. What do you think of that, Mrs.
LINE 189: Huntingdon?" asked Mr. Hargrave, after a short pause, during which I
LINE 190: had felt he was keenly examining my half-averted face.
LINE 191: "I say," replied I, calmly, "that what he prizes so lightly will not be
LINE 192: long in his possession."
LINE 193: "You cannot mean that you will break your heart and die for the
LINE 194: detestable conduct of an infamous villain like that!"
LINE 195: "By no means: my heart is too thoroughly dried to be broken in a hurry,
LINE 196: and I mean to live as long as I can."
LINE 197: "Will you leave him then?"
LINE 198: "Yes."
LINE 199: "When: and how?" asked he, eagerly.
LINE 200: "_When_ I am ready, and _how_ I can manage it most effectually."
LINE 201: "But your child?"
LINE 202: "My child goes with me."
LINE 203: "He will not allow it."
LINE 204: "I shall not ask him."
LINE 205: "Ah, then, it is a secret flight you meditate! but with whom, Mrs.
LINE 206: Huntingdon?"
LINE 207: "With my son: and possibly, his nurse."
LINE 208: "Alone—and unprotected! But where can you go? what can you do? He will
LINE 209: follow you and bring you back."
LINE 210: "I have laid my plans too well for that. Let me once get clear of
LINE 211: Grassdale, and I shall consider myself safe."
LINE 212: Mr. Hargrave advanced one step towards me, looked me in the face, and
LINE 213: drew in his breath to speak; but that look, that heightened colour,
LINE 214: that sudden sparkle of the eye, made my blood rise in wrath: I abruptly
LINE 215: turned away, and, snatching up my brush, began to dash away at my
LINE 216: canvas with rather too much energy for the good of the picture.
LINE 217: "Mrs. Huntingdon," said he with bitter solemnity, "you are cruel—cruel
LINE 218: to me—cruel to yourself."
LINE 219: "Mr. Hargrave, remember your promise."
LINE 220: "I _must_ speak: my heart will burst if I don't! I have been silent
LINE 221: long enough, and you _must_ hear me!" cried he, boldly intercepting my
LINE 222: retreat to the door. "You tell me you owe no allegiance to your
LINE 223: husband; he openly declares himself weary of you, and calmly gives you
LINE 224: up to anybody that will take you; you are about to leave him; no one
LINE 225: will believe that you go alone; all the world will say, 'She has left
LINE 226: him at last, and who can wonder at it? Few can blame her, fewer still
LINE 227: can pity him; but who is the companion of her flight?' Thus you will
LINE 228: have no credit for your virtue (if you call it such): even your best
LINE 229: friends will not believe in it; because it is monstrous, and not to be
LINE 230: credited but by those who suffer, from the effects of it, such cruel
LINE 231: torments that they know it to be indeed reality. But what can you do in
LINE 232: the cold, rough world alone? you, a young and inexperienced woman,
LINE 233: delicately nurtured, and utterly—"
LINE 234: "In a word, you would advise me to stay where I am," interrupted I.
LINE 235: "Well, I'll see about it."
LINE 236: "By _all means_, leave him!" cried he earnestly; "but NOT alone! Helen!
LINE 237: let _me_ protect you!"
LINE 238: "Never! while heaven spares my reason," replied I, snatching away the
LINE 239: hand he had presumed to seize and press between his own. But he was in
LINE 240: for it now; he had fairly broken the barrier: he was completely roused,
LINE 241: and determined to hazard all for victory.
LINE 242: "I must not be denied!" exclaimed he, vehemently; and seizing both my
LINE 243: hands, he held them very tight, but dropped upon his knee, and looked
LINE 244: up in my face with a half-imploring, half-imperious gaze. "You have no
LINE 245: reason now: you are flying in the face of heaven's decrees. God has
LINE 246: designed me to be your comfort and protector—I feel it, I know it as
LINE 247: certainly as if a voice from heaven declared, 'Ye twain shall be one
LINE 248: flesh'—and you spurn me from you—"
LINE 249: "Let me go, Mr. Hargrave!" said I, sternly. But he only tightened his
LINE 250: grasp.
LINE 251: "Let me go!" I repeated, quivering with indignation.
LINE 252: His face was almost opposite the window as he knelt. With a slight
LINE 253: start, I saw him glance towards it; and then a gleam of malicious
LINE 254: triumph lit up his countenance. Looking over my shoulder, I beheld a
LINE 255: shadow just retiring round the corner.
LINE 256: "That is Grimsby," said he deliberately. "He will report what he has
LINE 257: seen to Huntingdon and all the rest, with such embellishments as he
LINE 258: thinks proper. He has no love for you, Mrs. Huntingdon—no reverence for
LINE 259: your sex, no belief in virtue, no admiration for its image. He will
LINE 260: give such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all about
LINE 261: your character, in the minds of those who hear it. Your fair fame is
LINE 262: gone; and nothing that I or you can say can ever retrieve it. But give
LINE 263: me the power to protect you, and show me the villain that dares to
LINE 264: insult!"
LINE 265: "No one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now!" said I, at
LINE 266: length releasing my hands, and recoiling from him.
LINE 267: "I do not insult you," cried he: "I worship you. You are my angel, my
LINE 268: divinity! I lay my powers at your feet, and you must and shall accept
LINE 269: them!" he exclaimed, impetuously starting to his feet. "I _will_ be
LINE 270: your consoler and defender! and if your conscience upbraid you for it,
LINE 271: say I overcame you, and you could not choose but yield!"
LINE 272: I never saw a man go terribly excited. He precipitated himself towards
LINE 273: me. I snatched up my palette-knife and held it against him. This
LINE 274: startled him: he stood and gazed at me in astonishment; I daresay I
LINE 275: looked as fierce and resolute as he. I moved to the bell, and put my
LINE 276: hand upon the cord. This tamed him still more. With a
LINE 277: half-authoritative, half-deprecating wave of the hand, he sought to
LINE 278: deter me from ringing.
LINE 279: "Stand off, then!" said I; he stepped back. "And listen to me. I don't
LINE 280: like you," I continued, as deliberately and emphatically as I could, to
LINE 281: give the greater efficacy to my words; "and if I were divorced from my
LINE 282: husband, or if he were dead, I would not marry you. There now! I hope
LINE 283: you're satisfied."
LINE 284: His face grew blanched with anger.
LINE 285: "I _am_ satisfied," he replied, with bitter emphasis, "that you are the
LINE 286: most cold-hearted, unnatural, ungrateful woman I ever yet beheld!"
LINE 287: "Ungrateful, sir?"
LINE 288: "Ungrateful."
LINE 289: "No, Mr. Hargrave, I am not. For all the good you ever did me, or ever
LINE 290: wished to do, I most sincerely thank you: for all the evil you have
LINE 291: done me, and all you would have done, I pray God to pardon you, and
LINE 292: make you of a better mind."
LINE 293: Here the door was thrown open, and Messrs. Huntingdon and Hattersley
LINE 294: appeared without. The latter remained in the hall, busy with his ramrod
LINE 295: and his gun; the former walked in, and stood with his back to the fire,
LINE 296: surveying Mr. Hargrave and me, particularly the former, with a smile of
LINE 297: insupportable meaning, accompanied as it was by the impudence of his
LINE 298: brazen brow, and the sly, malicious, twinkle of his eye.
LINE 299: "Well, sir?" said Hargrave, interrogatively, and with the air of one
LINE 300: prepared to stand on the defensive.
LINE 301: "Well, sir," returned his host.
LINE 302: "We want to know if you are at liberty to join us in a go at the
LINE 303: pheasants, Walter," interposed Hattersley from without. "Come! there
LINE 304: shall be nothing shot besides, except a puss or two; _I'll_ vouch for
LINE 305: that."
LINE 306: Walter did not answer, but walked to the window to collect his
LINE 307: faculties. Arthur uttered a low whistle, and followed him with his
LINE 308: eyes. A slight flush of anger rose to Hargrave's cheek; but in a moment
LINE 309: he turned calmly round, and said carelessly:
LINE 310: "I came here to bid farewell to Mrs. Huntingdon, and tell her I must go
LINE 311: to-morrow."
LINE 312: "Humph! You're mighty sudden in your resolution. What takes you off so
LINE 313: soon, may I ask?"
LINE 314: "Business," returned he, repelling the other's incredulous sneer with a
LINE 315: glance of scornful defiance.
LINE 316: "Very good," was the reply; and Hargrave walked away. Thereupon Mr.
LINE 317: Huntingdon, gathering his coat-laps under his arms, and setting his
LINE 318: shoulder against the mantel-piece, turned to me, and, addressing me in
LINE 319: a low voice, scarcely above his breath, poured forth a volley of the
LINE 320: vilest and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to
LINE 321: conceive or the tongue to utter. I did not attempt to interrupt him;
LINE 322: but my spirit kindled within me, and when he had done, I replied, "If
LINE 323: your accusation were true, Mr. Huntingdon, how _dare you_ blame me?"
LINE 324: "She's hit it, by Jove!" cried Hattersley, rearing his gun against the
LINE 325: wall; and, stepping into the room, he took his precious friend by the
LINE 326: arm, and attempted to drag him away. "Come, my lad," he muttered; "true
LINE 327: or false, _you've_ no right to blame her, you _know_, nor him either;
LINE 328: after what you said last night. So come along."
LINE 329: There was something implied here that I could not endure.
LINE 330: "Dare you suspect me, Mr. Hattersley?" said I, almost beside myself
LINE 331: with fury.
LINE 332: "Nay, nay, I suspect nobody. It's all right, it's all right. So come
LINE 333: along, Huntingdon, you blackguard."
LINE 334: "She can't deny it!" cried the gentleman thus addressed, grinning in
LINE 335: mingled rage and triumph. "She can't deny it if her life depended on
LINE 336: it!" and muttering some more abusive language, he walked into the hall,
LINE 337: and took up his hat and gun from the table.
LINE 338: "I scorn to justify myself to you!" said I. "But you," turning to
LINE 339: Hattersley, "if you presume to have any doubts on the subject, ask Mr.
LINE 340: Hargrave."
LINE 341: At this they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made my whole
LINE 342: frame tingle to the fingers' ends.
LINE 343: "Where is he? I'll ask him myself!" said I, advancing towards them.
LINE 344: Suppressing a new burst of merriment, Hattersley pointed to the outer
LINE 345: door. It was half open. His brother-in-law was standing on the front
LINE 346: without.
LINE 347: "Mr. Hargrave, will you please to step this way?" said I.
LINE 348: He turned and looked at me in grave surprise.
LINE 349: "Step this way, if you please!" I repeated, in so determined a manner
LINE 350: that he could not, or did not choose to resist its authority. Somewhat
LINE 351: reluctantly he ascended the steps and advanced a pace or two into the
LINE 352: hall.
LINE 353: "And tell those gentlemen," I continued—"these men, whether or not I
LINE 354: yielded to your solicitations."
LINE 355: "I don't understand you, Mrs. Huntingdon."
LINE 356: "You _do_ understand me, sir; and I charge you, upon your honour as a
LINE 357: gentleman (if you have any), to answer truly. Did I, or did I not?"
LINE 358: "No," muttered he, turning away.
LINE 359: "Speak up, sir; they can't hear you. Did I grant your request?
LINE 360: "You did not."
LINE 361: "No, I'll be sworn she didn't," said Hattersley, "or he'd never look so
LINE 362: black."
LINE 363: "I'm willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman, Huntingdon,"
LINE 364: said Mr. Hargrave, calmly addressing his host, but with a bitter sneer
LINE 365: upon his countenance.
LINE 366: "Go to the deuce!" replied the latter, with an impatient jerk of the
LINE 367: head. Hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain, saying,—"You know
LINE 368: where to find me, should you feel disposed to send a friend."
LINE 369: Muttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation obtained.
LINE 370: "Now, Huntingdon, you see!" said Hattersley. "Clear as the day."
LINE 371: "I don't care _what_ he sees," said I, "or what he imagines; but you,
LINE 372: Mr. Hattersley, when you hear my name belied and slandered, will you
LINE 373: defend it?"
LINE 374: "I will."
LINE 375: I instantly departed and shut myself into the library. What could
LINE 376: possess me to make such a request of such a man I cannot tell; but
LINE 377: drowning men catch at straws: they had driven me desperate between
LINE 378: them; I hardly knew what I said. There was no other to preserve my name
LINE 379: from being blackened and aspersed among this nest of boon companions,
LINE 380: and through them, perhaps, into the world; and beside my abandoned
LINE 381: wretch of a husband, the base, malignant Grimsby, and the false villain
LINE 382: Hargrave, this boorish ruffian, coarse and brutal as he was, shone like
LINE 383: a glow-worm in the dark, among its fellow worms.
LINE 384: What a scene was this! Could I ever have imagined that I should be
LINE 385: doomed to bear such insults under my own roof—to hear such things
LINE 386: spoken in my presence; nay, spoken _to_ me and _of_ me; and by those
LINE 387: who arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen? And could I have
LINE 388: imagined that I should have been able to endure it as calmly, and to
LINE 389: repel their insults as firmly and as boldly as I had done? A hardness
LINE 390: such as this is taught by rough experience and despair alone.
LINE 391: Such thoughts as these chased one another through my mind, as I paced
LINE 392: to and fro the room, and longed—oh, _how_ I longed—to take my child and
LINE 393: leave them now, without an hour's delay! But it could not be; there was
LINE 394: work before me: hard work, that must be done.
LINE 395: "Then let me do it," said I, "and lose not a moment in vain repinings
LINE 396: and idle chafings against my fate, and those who influence it."
LINE 397: And conquering my agitation with a powerful effort, I immediately
LINE 398: resumed my task, and laboured hard all day.
LINE 399: Mr. Hargrave did depart on the morrow; and I have never seen him since.
LINE 400: The others stayed on for two or three weeks longer; but I kept aloof
LINE 401: from them as much as possible, and still continued my labour, and have
LINE 402: continued it, with almost unabated ardour, to the present day. I soon
LINE 403: acquainted Rachel with my design, confiding all my motives and
LINE 404: intentions to her ear, and, much to my agreeable surprise, found little
LINE 405: difficulty in persuading her to enter into my views. She is a sober,
LINE 406: cautious woman, but she so hates her master, and so loves her mistress
LINE 407: and her nursling, that after several ejaculations, a few faint
LINE 408: objections, and many tears and lamentations that I should be brought to
LINE 409: such a pass, she applauded my resolution and consented to aid me with
LINE 410: all her might: on one condition only: that she might share my exile:
LINE 411: otherwise, she was utterly inexorable, regarding it as perfect madness
LINE 412: for me and Arthur to go alone. With touching generosity, she modestly
LINE 413: offered to aid me with her little hoard of savings, hoping I would
LINE 414: "excuse her for the liberty, but really, if I would do her the favour
LINE 415: to accept it as a loan, she would be very happy." Of course I could not
LINE 416: think of such a thing; but now, thank heaven, I have gathered a little
LINE 417: hoard of my own, and my preparations are so far advanced that I am
LINE 418: looking forward to a speedy emancipation. Only let the stormy severity
LINE 419: of this winter weather be somewhat abated, and then, some morning, Mr.
LINE 420: Huntingdon will come down to a solitary breakfast-table, and perhaps be
LINE 421: clamouring through the house for his invisible wife and child, when
LINE 422: they are some fifty miles on their way to the Western world, or it may
LINE 423: be more: for we shall leave him hours before the dawn, and it is not
LINE 424: probable he will discover the loss of both until the day is far
LINE 425: advanced.
LINE 426: I am fully alive to the evils that may and must result upon the step I
LINE 427: am about to take; but I never waver in my resolution, because I never
LINE 428: forget my son. It was only this morning, while I pursued my usual
LINE 429: employment, he was sitting at my feet, quietly playing with the shreds
LINE 430: of canvas I had thrown upon the carpet; but his mind was otherwise
LINE 431: occupied, for, in a while, he looked up wistfully in my face, and
LINE 432: gravely asked,—"Mamma, why are you wicked?"
LINE 433: "Who told you I was wicked, love?"
LINE 434: "Rachel."
LINE 435: "No, Arthur, Rachel never said so, I am certain."
LINE 436: "Well, then, it was papa," replied he, thoughtfully. Then, after a
LINE 437: reflective pause, he added, "At least, I'll tell you how it was I got
LINE 438: to know: when I'm with papa, if I say mamma wants me, or mamma says I'm
LINE 439: not to do something that he tells me to do, he always says, 'Mamma be
LINE 440: damned,' and Rachel says it's only wicked people that are damned. So,
LINE 441: mamma, that's why I think you must be wicked: and I wish you wouldn't."
LINE 442: "My dear child, I am not. Those are bad words, and wicked people often
LINE 443: say them of others better than themselves. Those words cannot make
LINE 444: people be damned, nor show that they deserve it. God will judge us by
LINE 445: our own thoughts and deeds, not by what others say about us. And when
LINE 446: you hear such words spoken, Arthur, remember never to repeat them: it
LINE 447: is wicked to say such things of others, not to have them said against
LINE 448: you."
LINE 449: "Then it's papa that's wicked," said he, ruefully.
LINE 450: "Papa is wrong to say such things, and you will be very wrong to
LINE 451: imitate him now that you know better."
LINE 452: "What _is_ imitate?"
LINE 453: "To do as he does."
LINE 454: "Does _he_ know better?"
LINE 455: "Perhaps he does; but that is nothing to you."
LINE 456: "If he doesn't, you ought to tell him, mamma."
LINE 457: "I _have_ told him."
LINE 458: The little moralist paused and pondered. I tried in vain to divert his
LINE 459: mind from the subject.
LINE 460: "I'm sorry papa's wicked," said he mournfully, at length, "for I don't
LINE 461: want him to go to hell." And so saying he burst into tears.
LINE 462: I consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter and
LINE 463: become good before he died—; but is it not time to deliver him from
LINE 464: such a parent?
