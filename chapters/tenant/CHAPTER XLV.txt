LINE 1: Well, Halford, what do you think of all this? and while you read it,
LINE 2: did you ever picture to yourself what my feelings would probably be
LINE 3: during its perusal? Most likely not; but I am not going to descant upon
LINE 4: them now: I will only make this acknowledgment, little honourable as it
LINE 5: may be to human nature, and especially to myself,—that the former half
LINE 6: of the narrative was, to me, more painful than the latter, not that I
LINE 7: was at all insensible to Mrs. Huntingdon's wrongs or unmoved by her
LINE 8: sufferings, but, I must confess, I felt a kind of selfish gratification
LINE 9: in watching her husband's gradual decline in her good graces, and
LINE 10: seeing how completely he extinguished all her affection at last. The
LINE 11: effect of the whole, however, in spite of all my sympathy for her, and
LINE 12: my fury against him, was to relieve my mind of an intolerable burden,
LINE 13: and fill my heart with joy, as if some friend had roused me from a
LINE 14: dreadful nightmare.
LINE 15: It was now near eight o'clock in the morning, for my candle had expired
LINE 16: in the midst of my perusal, leaving me no alternative but to get
LINE 17: another, at the expense of alarming the house, or to go to bed, and
LINE 18: wait the return of daylight. On my mother's account, I chose the
LINE 19: latter; but how _willingly_ I sought my pillow, and how much sleep it
LINE 20: brought me, I leave you to imagine.
LINE 21: At the first appearance of dawn, I rose, and brought the manuscript to
LINE 22: the window, but it was impossible to read it yet. I devoted half an
LINE 23: hour to dressing, and then returned to it again. Now, with a little
LINE 24: difficulty, I could manage; and with intense and eager interest, I
LINE 25: devoured the remainder of its contents. When it was ended, and my
LINE 26: transient regret at its abrupt conclusion was over, I opened the window
LINE 27: and put out my head to catch the cooling breeze, and imbibe deep
LINE 28: draughts of the pure morning air. A splendid morning it was; the
LINE 29: half-frozen dew lay thick on the grass, the swallows were twittering
LINE 30: round me, the rooks cawing, and cows lowing in the distance; and early
LINE 31: frost and summer sunshine mingled their sweetness in the air. But I did
LINE 32: not think of that: a confusion of countless thoughts and varied
LINE 33: emotions crowded upon me while I gazed abstractedly on the lovely face
LINE 34: of nature. Soon, however, this chaos of thoughts and passions cleared
LINE 35: away, giving place to two distinct emotions: joy unspeakable that my
LINE 36: adored Helen was all I wished to think her—that through the noisome
LINE 37: vapours of the world's aspersions and my own fancied convictions, her
LINE 38: character shone bright, and clear, and stainless as that sun I could
LINE 39: not bear to look on; and shame and deep remorse for my own conduct.
LINE 40: Immediately after breakfast I hurried over to Wildfell Hall. Rachel had
LINE 41: risen many degrees in my estimation since yesterday. I was ready to
LINE 42: greet her quite as an old friend; but every kindly impulse was checked
LINE 43: by the look of cold distrust she cast upon me on opening the door. The
LINE 44: old virgin had constituted herself the guardian of her lady's honour, I
LINE 45: suppose, and doubtless she saw in me another Mr. Hargrave, only the
LINE 46: more dangerous in being more esteemed and trusted by her mistress.
LINE 47: "Missis can't see any one to-day, sir—she's poorly," said she, in
LINE 48: answer to my inquiry for Mrs. Graham.
LINE 49: "But I must see her, Rachel," said I, placing my hand on the door to
LINE 50: prevent its being shut against me.
LINE 51: "Indeed, sir, you can't," replied she, settling her countenance in
LINE 52: still more iron frigidity than before.
LINE 53: "Be so good as to announce me."
LINE 54: "It's no manner of use, Mr. Markham; she's poorly, I tell you."
LINE 55: Just in time to prevent me from committing the impropriety of taking
LINE 56: the citadel by storm, and pushing forward unannounced, an inner door
LINE 57: opened, and little Arthur appeared with his frolicsome playfellow, the
LINE 58: dog. He seized my hand between both his, and smilingly drew me forward.
LINE 59: "Mamma says you're to come in, Mr. Markham," said he, "and I am to go
LINE 60: out and play with Rover."
LINE 61: Rachel retired with a sigh, and I stepped into the parlour and shut the
LINE 62: door. There, before the fire-place, stood the tall, graceful figure,
LINE 63: wasted with many sorrows. I cast the manuscript on the table, and
LINE 64: looked in her face. Anxious and pale, it was turned towards me; her
LINE 65: clear, dark eyes were fixed on mine with a gaze so intensely earnest
LINE 66: that they bound me like a spell.
LINE 67: "Have you looked it over?" she murmured. The spell was broken.
LINE 68: "I've read it through," said I, advancing into the room,—"and I want to
LINE 69: know if you'll forgive me—if you _can_ forgive me?"
LINE 70: She did not answer, but her eyes glistened, and a faint red mantled on
LINE 71: her lip and cheek. As I approached, she abruptly turned away, and went
LINE 72: to the window. It was not in anger, I was well assured, but only to
LINE 73: conceal or control her emotion. I therefore ventured to follow and
LINE 74: stand beside her there,—but not to speak. She gave me her hand, without
LINE 75: turning her head, and murmured in a voice she strove in vain to
LINE 76: steady,—
LINE 77: "Can _you_ forgive _me?_"
LINE 78: It might be deemed a breach of trust, I thought, to convey that lily
LINE 79: hand to my lips, so I only gently pressed it between my own, and
LINE 80: smilingly replied,—"I hardly can. You should have told me this before.
LINE 81: It shows a want of confidence—"
LINE 82: "Oh, no," cried she, eagerly interrupting me; "it was not that. It was
LINE 83: no want of confidence in you; but if I had told you anything of my
LINE 84: history, I must have told you all, in order to excuse my conduct; and I
LINE 85: might well shrink from such a disclosure, till necessity obliged me to
LINE 86: make it. But you forgive me?—I have done very, very wrong, I know; but,
LINE 87: as usual, I have reaped the bitter fruits of my own error,—and must
LINE 88: reap them to the end."
LINE 89: Bitter, indeed, was the tone of anguish, repressed by resolute
LINE 90: firmness, in which this was spoken. Now, I raised her hand to my lips,
LINE 91: and fervently kissed it again and again; for tears prevented any other
LINE 92: reply. She suffered these wild caresses without resistance or
LINE 93: resentment; then, suddenly turning from me, she paced twice or thrice
LINE 94: through the room. I knew by the contraction of her brow, the tight
LINE 95: compression of her lips, and wringing of her hands, that meantime a
LINE 96: violent conflict between reason and passion was silently passing
LINE 97: within. At length she paused before the empty fire-place, and turning
LINE 98: to me, said calmly—if that might be called calmness which was so
LINE 99: evidently the result of a violent effort,—
LINE 100: "Now, Gilbert, you must leave me—not this moment, but soon—and you must
LINE 101: _never come again_."
LINE 102: "Never again, Helen? just when I love you more than ever."
LINE 103: "For that very reason, if it be so, we should not meet again. I thought
LINE 104: _this_ interview was necessary—at least, I persuaded myself it was
LINE 105: so—that we might severally ask and receive each other's pardon for the
LINE 106: past; but there can be no excuse for another. I shall leave this place,
LINE 107: as soon as I have means to seek another asylum; but our intercourse
LINE 108: must end here."
LINE 109: "End here!" echoed I; and approaching the high, carved chimney-piece, I
LINE 110: leant my hand against its heavy mouldings, and dropped my forehead upon
LINE 111: it in silent, sullen despondency.
LINE 112: "You must not come again," continued she. There was a slight tremor in
LINE 113: her voice, but I thought her whole manner was provokingly composed,
LINE 114: considering the dreadful sentence she pronounced. "You must know why I
LINE 115: tell you so," she resumed; "and you must see that it is better to part
LINE 116: at once:—if it be hard to say adieu for ever, you ought to help me."
LINE 117: She paused. I did not answer. "Will you promise not to come?—if you
LINE 118: won't, and if you do come here again, you will drive me away before I
LINE 119: know where to find another place of refuge—or how to seek it."
LINE 120: "Helen," said I, turning impatiently towards her, "I cannot discuss the
LINE 121: matter of eternal separation calmly and dispassionately as you can do.
LINE 122: It is no question of mere expedience with _me;_ it is a question of
LINE 123: life and death!"
LINE 124: She was silent. Her pale lips quivered, and her fingers trembled with
LINE 125: agitation, as she nervously entwined them in the hair-chain to which
LINE 126: was appended her small gold watch—the only thing of value she had
LINE 127: permitted herself to keep. I had said an unjust and cruel thing; but I
LINE 128: must needs follow it up with something worse.
LINE 129: "But, Helen!" I began in a soft, low tone, not daring to raise my eyes
LINE 130: to her face, "that man is not your husband: in the sight of heaven he
LINE 131: has forfeited all claim to—" She seized my arm with a grasp of
LINE 132: startling energy.
LINE 133: "_Gilbert, don't!_" she cried, in a tone that would have pierced a
LINE 134: heart of adamant. "For God's sake, don't _you_ attempt these arguments!
LINE 135: No _fiend_ could torture me like this!"
LINE 136: "I won't, I won't!" said I, gently laying my hand on hers; almost as
LINE 137: much alarmed at her vehemence as ashamed of my own misconduct.
LINE 138: "Instead of acting like a true friend," continued she, breaking from
LINE 139: me, and throwing herself into the old arm-chair, "and helping me with
LINE 140: all your might—or rather taking your own part in the struggle of right
LINE 141: against passion—you leave all the burden to me;—and not satisfied with
LINE 142: that, you do your utmost to fight against me—when you know that!—" she
LINE 143: paused, and hid her face in her handkerchief.
LINE 144: "Forgive me, Helen!" pleaded I. "I will never utter another word on the
LINE 145: subject. But may we not still meet as friends?"
LINE 146: "It will not do," she replied, mournfully shaking her head; and then
LINE 147: she raised her eyes to mine, with a mildly reproachful look that seemed
LINE 148: to say, "You must know that as well as I."
LINE 149: "Then what _must_ we do?" cried I, passionately. But immediately I
LINE 150: added in a quieter tone—"I'll do whatever you desire; only _don't_ say
LINE 151: that this meeting is to be our last."
LINE 152: "And why not? Don't you know that every time we meet the thoughts of
LINE 153: the final parting will become more painful? Don't you _feel_ that every
LINE 154: interview makes us dearer to each other than the last?"
LINE 155: The utterance of this last question was hurried and low, and the
LINE 156: downcast eyes and burning blush too plainly showed that _she_, at
LINE 157: least, had felt it. It was scarcely prudent to make such an admission,
LINE 158: or to add—as she presently did—"I have power to bid you go, now:
LINE 159: another time it might be different,"—but I was not base enough to
LINE 160: attempt to take advantage of her candour.
LINE 161: "But we may write," I timidly suggested. "You will not deny me that
LINE 162: consolation?"
LINE 163: "We can hear of each other through my brother."
LINE 164: "Your brother!" A pang of remorse and shame shot through me. She had
LINE 165: not heard of the injury he had sustained at my hands; and I had not the
LINE 166: courage to tell her. "Your brother will not help us," I said: "he would
LINE 167: have all communion between us to be entirely at an end."
LINE 168: "And he would be right, I suppose. As a friend of both, he would wish
LINE 169: us both well; and every friend would tell us it was our interest, as
LINE 170: well as our duty, to forget each other, though we might not see it
LINE 171: ourselves. But don't be afraid, Gilbert," she added, smiling sadly at
LINE 172: my manifest discomposure; "there is little chance of my forgetting you.
LINE 173: But I did not mean that Frederick should be the means of transmitting
LINE 174: messages between us—only that each might know, through him, of the
LINE 175: other's welfare;—and more than this ought not to be: for you are young,
LINE 176: Gilbert, and you ought to marry—and will some time, though you may
LINE 177: think it impossible now: and though I hardly can say I wish you to
LINE 178: forget me, I know it is right that you should, both for your own
LINE 179: happiness, and that of your future wife;—and therefore I must and will
LINE 180: wish it," she added resolutely.
LINE 181: "And you are young too, Helen," I boldly replied; "and when that
LINE 182: profligate scoundrel has run through his career, you will give your
LINE 183: hand to me—I'll wait till then."
LINE 184: But she would not leave me this support. Independently of the moral
LINE 185: evil of basing our hopes upon the death of another, who, if unfit for
LINE 186: this world, was at least no less so for the next, and whose
LINE 187: amelioration would thus become our bane and his greatest transgression
LINE 188: our greatest benefit,—she maintained it to be madness: many men of Mr.
LINE 189: Huntingdon's habits had lived to a ripe though miserable old age. "And
LINE 190: if I," said she, "am young in years, I am old in sorrow; but even if
LINE 191: trouble should fail to kill me before vice destroys him, think, if he
LINE 192: reached but fifty years or so, would you wait twenty or fifteen—in
LINE 193: vague uncertainty and suspense—through all the prime of youth and
LINE 194: manhood—and marry at last a woman faded and worn as I shall be—without
LINE 195: ever having seen me from this day to that?—You would not," she
LINE 196: continued, interrupting my earnest protestations of unfailing
LINE 197: constancy,—"or if you would, you should not. Trust me, Gilbert; in this
LINE 198: matter I know better than you. You think me cold and stony-hearted, and
LINE 199: you may, but—"
LINE 200: "I don't, Helen."
LINE 201: "Well, never mind: you might if you would: but I have not spent my
LINE 202: solitude in utter idleness, and I am not speaking now from the impulse
LINE 203: of the moment, as you do. I have thought of all these matters again and
LINE 204: again; I have argued these questions with myself, and pondered well our
LINE 205: past, and present, and future career; and, believe me, I have come to
LINE 206: the right conclusion at last. Trust my words rather than your own
LINE 207: feelings now, and in a few years you will see that I was right—though
LINE 208: at present I hardly can see it myself," she murmured with a sigh as she
LINE 209: rested her head on her hand. "And don't argue against me any more: all
LINE 210: you can say has been already said by my own heart and refuted by my
LINE 211: reason. It was hard enough to combat those suggestions as they were
LINE 212: whispered within me; in your mouth they are ten times worse, and if you
LINE 213: knew how much they pain me you would cease at once, I know. If you knew
LINE 214: my present feelings, you would even try to relieve them at the expense
LINE 215: of your own."
LINE 216: "I will go—in a minute, if _that_ can relieve you—and NEVER return!"
LINE 217: said I, with bitter emphasis. "But, if we may never meet, and never
LINE 218: hope to meet again, is it a crime to exchange our thoughts by letter?
LINE 219: May not kindred spirits meet, and mingle in communion, whatever be the
LINE 220: fate and circumstances of their earthly tenements?"
LINE 221: "They may, they may!" cried she, with a momentary burst of glad
LINE 222: enthusiasm. "I thought of that too, Gilbert, but I feared to mention
LINE 223: it, because I feared you would not understand my views upon the
LINE 224: subject. I fear it even now—I fear any kind friend would tell us we are
LINE 225: _both_ deluding ourselves with the idea of keeping up a spiritual
LINE 226: intercourse without hope or prospect of anything further—without
LINE 227: fostering vain regrets and hurtful aspirations, and feeding thoughts
LINE 228: that should be sternly and pitilessly left to perish of inanition."
LINE 229: "Never mind our kind friends: if they can part our bodies, it is
LINE 230: enough; in God's name, let them not sunder our souls!" cried I, in
LINE 231: terror lest she should deem it her duty to deny us this last remaining
LINE 232: consolation.
LINE 233: "But no letters can pass between us here," said she, "without giving
LINE 234: fresh food for scandal; and when I departed, I had intended that my new
LINE 235: abode should be unknown to you as to the rest of the world; not that I
LINE 236: should doubt your word if you promised not to visit me, but I thought
LINE 237: you would be more tranquil in your own mind if you knew you could not
LINE 238: do it, and likely to find less difficulty in abstracting yourself from
LINE 239: me if you could not picture my situation to your mind. But listen,"
LINE 240: said she, smilingly putting up her finger to check my impatient reply:
LINE 241: "in six months you shall hear from Frederick precisely where I am; and
LINE 242: if you still retain your wish to write to me, and think you can
LINE 243: maintain a correspondence all thought, all spirit—such as disembodied
LINE 244: souls or unimpassioned friends, at least, might hold,—write, and I will
LINE 245: answer you."
LINE 246: "Six months!"
LINE 247: "Yes, to give your present ardour time to cool, and try the truth and
LINE 248: constancy of your soul's love for mine. And now, enough has been said
LINE 249: between us. Why can't we part at once?" exclaimed she, almost wildly,
LINE 250: after a moment's pause, as she suddenly rose from her chair, with her
LINE 251: hands resolutely clasped together. I thought it was my duty to go
LINE 252: without delay; and I approached and half extended my hand as if to take
LINE 253: leave—she grasped it in silence. But this thought of final separation
LINE 254: was too intolerable: it seemed to squeeze the blood out of my heart;
LINE 255: and my feet were glued to the floor.
LINE 256: "And must we never meet again?" I murmured, in the anguish of my soul.
LINE 257: "We shall meet in heaven. Let us think of that," said she in a tone of
LINE 258: desperate calmness; but her eyes glittered wildly, and her face was
LINE 259: deadly pale.
LINE 260: "But not as we are now," I could not help replying. "It gives me little
LINE 261: consolation to think I shall next behold you as a disembodied spirit,
LINE 262: or an altered being, with a frame perfect and glorious, but not like
LINE 263: this!—and a heart, perhaps, entirely estranged from me."
LINE 264: "No, Gilbert, there is perfect love in heaven!"
LINE 265: "_So_ perfect, I suppose, that it soars above distinctions, and you
LINE 266: will have no closer sympathy with me than with any one of the ten
LINE 267: thousand thousand angels and the innumerable multitude of happy spirits
LINE 268: round us."
LINE 269: "Whatever I am, you will be the same, and, therefore, cannot possibly
LINE 270: regret it; and whatever that change may be we know it must be for the
LINE 271: better."
LINE 272: "But if I am to be so changed that I shall cease to adore you with my
LINE 273: whole heart and soul, and love you beyond every other creature, I shall
LINE 274: not be myself; and though, if ever I win heaven at all, I must, I know,
LINE 275: be infinitely better and happier than I am now, my earthly nature
LINE 276: cannot rejoice in the anticipation of such beatitude, from which itself
LINE 277: and its chief joy must be excluded."
LINE 278: "Is your love _all_ earthly, then?"
LINE 279: "No, but I am supposing we shall have no more intimate communion with
LINE 280: each other than with the rest."
LINE 281: "If so, it will be because we love them more, and not each other less.
LINE 282: Increase of love brings increase of happiness, when it is mutual, and
LINE 283: pure as that will be."
LINE 284: "But can _you_, Helen, contemplate with delight this prospect of losing
LINE 285: me in a sea of glory?"
LINE 286: "I own I cannot; but we know not that it will be so;—and I do know that
LINE 287: to regret the exchange of earthly pleasures for the joys of heaven, is
LINE 288: as if the grovelling caterpillar should lament that it must one day
LINE 289: quit the nibbled leaf to soar aloft and flutter through the air, roving
LINE 290: at will from flower to flower, sipping sweet honey from their cups, or
LINE 291: basking in their sunny petals. If these little creatures knew how great
LINE 292: a change awaited them, no doubt they would regret it; but would not all
LINE 293: such sorrow be misplaced? And if that illustration will not move you,
LINE 294: here is another:—We are children now; we feel as children, and we
LINE 295: understand as children; and when we are told that men and women do not
LINE 296: play with toys, and that our companions will one day weary of the
LINE 297: trivial sports and occupations that interest them and us so deeply now,
LINE 298: we cannot help being saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration,
LINE 299: because we cannot conceive that as we grow up our own minds will become
LINE 300: so enlarged and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as
LINE 301: trifling those objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish, and that,
LINE 302: though our companions will no longer join us in those childish
LINE 303: pastimes, they will drink with us at other fountains of delight, and
LINE 304: mingle their souls with ours in higher aims and nobler occupations
LINE 305: beyond our present comprehension, but not less deeply relished or less
LINE 306: truly good for that, while yet both we and they remain essentially the
LINE 307: same individuals as before. But, Gilbert, can you really derive no
LINE 308: consolation from the thought that we may meet together where there is
LINE 309: no more pain and sorrow, no more striving against sin, and struggling
LINE 310: of the spirit against the flesh; where both will behold the same
LINE 311: glorious truths, and drink exalted and supreme felicity from the same
LINE 312: fountain of light and goodness—that Being whom both will worship with
LINE 313: the same intensity of holy ardour—and where pure and happy creatures
LINE 314: both will love with the same divine affection? If you cannot, never
LINE 315: write to me!"
LINE 316: "Helen, I can! if faith would never fail."
LINE 317: "Now, then," exclaimed she, "while this hope is strong within us—"
LINE 318: "We will part," I cried. "You shall not have the pain of another effort
LINE 319: to dismiss me. I will go at once; but—"
LINE 320: I did not put my request in words: she understood it instinctively, and
LINE 321: _this_ time she yielded too—or rather, there was nothing so deliberate
LINE 322: as requesting or yielding in the matter: there was a sudden impulse
LINE 323: that neither could resist. One moment I stood and looked into her face,
LINE 324: the next I held her to my heart, and we seemed to grow together in a
LINE 325: close embrace from which no physical or mental force could rend us. A
LINE 326: whispered "God bless you!" and "Go—go!" was all she said; but while she
LINE 327: spoke she held me so fast that, without violence, I could not have
LINE 328: obeyed her. At length, however, by some heroic effort, we tore
LINE 329: ourselves apart, and I rushed from the house.
LINE 330: I have a confused remembrance of seeing little Arthur running up the
LINE 331: garden-walk to meet me, and of bolting over the wall to avoid him—and
LINE 332: subsequently running down the steep fields, clearing the stone fences
LINE 333: and hedges as they came in my way, till I got completely out of sight
LINE 334: of the old hall and down to the bottom of the hill; and then of long
LINE 335: hours spent in bitter tears and lamentations, and melancholy musings in
LINE 336: the lonely valley, with the eternal music in my ears, of the west wind
LINE 337: rushing through the overshadowing trees, and the brook babbling and
LINE 338: gurgling along its stony bed; my eyes, for the most part, vacantly
LINE 339: fixed on the deep, chequered shades restlessly playing over the bright
LINE 340: sunny grass at my feet, where now and then a withered leaf or two would
LINE 341: come dancing to share the revelry; but my heart was away up the hill in
LINE 342: that dark room where she was weeping desolate and alone—she whom I was
LINE 343: not to comfort, not to see again, till years or suffering had overcome
LINE 344: us both, and torn our spirits from their perishing abodes of clay.
LINE 345: There was little business done that day, you may be sure. The farm was
LINE 346: abandoned to the labourers, and the labourers were left to their own
LINE 347: devices. But one duty must be attended to; I had not forgotten my
LINE 348: assault upon Frederick Lawrence; and I must see him to apologise for
LINE 349: the unhappy deed. I would fain have put it off till the morrow; but
LINE 350: what if he should denounce me to his sister in the meantime? No, no! I
LINE 351: must ask his pardon to-day, and entreat him to be lenient in his
LINE 352: accusation, if the revelation must be made. I deferred it, however,
LINE 353: till the evening, when my spirits were more composed, and when—oh,
LINE 354: wonderful perversity of human nature!—some faint germs of indefinite
LINE 355: hopes were beginning to rise in my mind; not that I intended to cherish
LINE 356: them, after all that had been said on the subject, but there they must
LINE 357: lie for a while, uncrushed though not encouraged, till I had learnt to
LINE 358: live without them.
LINE 359: Arrived at Woodford, the young squire's abode, I found no little
LINE 360: difficulty in obtaining admission to his presence. The servant that
LINE 361: opened the door told me his master was very ill, and seemed to think it
LINE 362: doubtful whether he would be able to see me. I was not going to be
LINE 363: baulked, however. I waited calmly in the hall to be announced, but
LINE 364: inwardly determined to take no denial. The message was such as I
LINE 365: expected—a polite intimation that Mr. Lawrence could see no one; he was
LINE 366: feverish, and must not be disturbed.
LINE 367: "I shall not disturb him long," said I; "but I must see him for a
LINE 368: moment: it is on business of importance that I wish to speak to him."
LINE 369: "I'll tell him, sir," said the man. And I advanced further into the
LINE 370: hall and followed him nearly to the door of the apartment where his
LINE 371: master was—for it seemed he was not in bed. The answer returned was
LINE 372: that Mr. Lawrence hoped I would be so good as to leave a message or a
LINE 373: note with the servant, as he could attend to no business at present.
LINE 374: "He may as well see me as you," said I; and, stepping past the
LINE 375: astonished footman, I boldly rapped at the door, entered, and closed it
LINE 376: behind me. The room was spacious and handsomely furnished—very
LINE 377: comfortably, too, for a bachelor. A clear, red fire was burning in the
LINE 378: polished grate: a superannuated greyhound, given up to idleness and
LINE 379: good living, lay basking before it on the thick, soft rug, on one
LINE 380: corner of which, beside the sofa, sat a smart young springer, looking
LINE 381: wistfully up in its master's face—perhaps asking permission to share
LINE 382: his couch, or, it might be, only soliciting a caress from his hand or a
LINE 383: kind word from his lips. The invalid himself looked very interesting as
LINE 384: he lay reclining there, in his elegant dressing-gown, with a silk
LINE 385: handkerchief bound across his temples. His usually pale face was
LINE 386: flushed and feverish; his eyes were half closed, until he became
LINE 387: sensible of my presence—and then he opened them wide enough: one hand
LINE 388: was thrown listlessly over the back of the sofa, and held a small
LINE 389: volume, with which, apparently, he had been vainly attempting to
LINE 390: beguile the weary hours. He dropped it, however, in his start of
LINE 391: indignant surprise as I advanced into the room and stood before him on
LINE 392: the rug. He raised himself on his pillows, and gazed upon me with equal
LINE 393: degrees of nervous horror, anger, and amazement depicted on his
LINE 394: countenance.
LINE 395: "Mr. Markham, I scarcely expected this!" he said; and the blood left
LINE 396: his cheek as he spoke.
LINE 397: "I know you didn't," answered I; "but be quiet a minute, and I'll tell
LINE 398: you what I came for." Unthinkingly, I advanced a step or two nearer. He
LINE 399: winced at my approach, with an expression of aversion and instinctive
LINE 400: physical fear anything but conciliatory to my feelings. I stepped back,
LINE 401: however.
LINE 402: "Make your story a short one," said he, putting his hand on the small
LINE 403: silver bell that stood on the table beside him, "or I shall be obliged
LINE 404: to call for assistance. I am in no state to bear your brutalities now,
LINE 405: or your presence either." And in truth the moisture started from his
LINE 406: pores and stood on his pale forehead like dew.
LINE 407: Such a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the difficulties of
LINE 408: my unenviable task. It must be performed however, in some fashion; and
LINE 409: so I plunged into it at once, and floundered through it as I could.
LINE 410: "The truth is, Lawrence," said I, "I have not acted quite correctly
LINE 411: towards you of late—especially on this last occasion; and I'm come
LINE 412: to—in short, to express my regret for what has been done, and to beg
LINE 413: your pardon. If you don't choose to grant it," I added hastily, not
LINE 414: liking the aspect of his face, "it's no matter; only _I've_ done _my_
LINE 415: duty—that's all."
LINE 416: "It's easily done," replied he, with a faint smile bordering on a
LINE 417: sneer: "to abuse your friend and knock him on the head without any
LINE 418: assignable cause, and then tell him the deed was not quite correct, but
LINE 419: it's no matter whether he pardons it or not."
LINE 420: "I forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a
LINE 421: mistake,"—muttered I. "I should have made a very handsome apology, but
LINE 422: you provoked me so confoundedly with your—. Well, I suppose it's my
LINE 423: fault. The fact is, I didn't know that you were Mrs. Graham's brother,
LINE 424: and I saw and heard some things respecting your conduct towards her
LINE 425: which were calculated to awaken unpleasant suspicions, that, allow me
LINE 426: to say, a little candour and confidence on your part might have
LINE 427: removed; and, at last, I chanced to overhear a part of a conversation
LINE 428: between you and her that made me think I had a right to hate you."
LINE 429: "And how came you to know that I was her brother?" asked he, in some
LINE 430: anxiety.
LINE 431: "She told me herself. She told me all. _She_ knew I might be trusted.
LINE 432: But you needn't disturb yourself about _that_, Mr. Lawrence, for I've
LINE 433: seen the last of her!"
LINE 434: "The last! Is she gone, then?"
LINE 435: "No; but she has bid adieu to me, and I have promised never to go near
LINE 436: that house again while she inhabits it." I could have groaned aloud at
LINE 437: the bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the discourse. But I only
LINE 438: clenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug. My companion,
LINE 439: however, was evidently relieved.
LINE 440: "You have done right," he said, in a tone of unqualified approbation,
LINE 441: while his face brightened into almost a sunny expression. "And as for
LINE 442: the mistake, I am sorry for both our sakes that it should have
LINE 443: occurred. Perhaps you can forgive my want of candour, and remember, as
LINE 444: some partial mitigation of the offence, how little encouragement to
LINE 445: friendly confidence you have given me of late."
LINE 446: "Yes, yes—I remember it all: nobody can blame me more than I blame
LINE 447: myself in my own heart; at any rate, nobody can regret more sincerely
LINE 448: than I do the result of my _brutality_, as you rightly term it."
LINE 449: "Never mind that," said he, faintly smiling; "let us forget all
LINE 450: unpleasant words on both sides, as well as deeds, and consign to
LINE 451: oblivion everything that we have cause to regret. Have you any
LINE 452: objection to take my hand, or you'd rather not?" It trembled through
LINE 453: weakness as he held it out, and dropped before I had time to catch it
LINE 454: and give it a hearty squeeze, which he had not the strength to return.
LINE 455: "How dry and burning your hand is, Lawrence," said I. "You are really
LINE 456: ill, and I have made you worse by all this talk."
LINE 457: "Oh, it is nothing; only a cold got by the rain."
LINE 458: "My doing, too."
LINE 459: "Never mind that. But tell me, did you mention this affair to my
LINE 460: sister?"
LINE 461: "To confess the truth, I had not the courage to do so; but when you
LINE 462: tell her, will you just say that I deeply regret it, and—?"
LINE 463: "Oh, never fear! I shall say nothing against you, as long as you keep
LINE 464: your good resolution of remaining aloof from her. She has not heard of
LINE 465: my illness, then, that you are aware of?"
LINE 466: "I think not."
LINE 467: "I'm glad of that, for I have been all this time tormenting myself with
LINE 468: the fear that somebody would tell her I was dying, or desperately ill,
LINE 469: and she would be either distressing herself on account of her inability
LINE 470: to hear from me or do me any good, or perhaps committing the madness of
LINE 471: coming to see me. I must contrive to let her know something about it,
LINE 472: if I can," continued he, reflectively, "or she will be hearing some
LINE 473: such story. Many would be glad to tell her such news, just to see how
LINE 474: she would take it; and then she might expose herself to fresh scandal."
LINE 475: "I wish I had told her," said I. "If it were not for my promise, I
LINE 476: would tell her now."
LINE 477: "By no means! I am not dreaming of that;—but if I were to write a short
LINE 478: note, now, not mentioning you, Markham, but just giving a slight
LINE 479: account of my illness, by way of excuse for my not coming to see her,
LINE 480: and to put her on her guard against any exaggerated reports she may
LINE 481: hear,—and address it in a disguised hand—would you do me the favour to
LINE 482: slip it into the post-office as you pass? for I dare not trust any of
LINE 483: the servants in such a case."
LINE 484: Most willingly I consented, and immediately brought him his desk. There
LINE 485: was little need to disguise his hand, for the poor fellow seemed to
LINE 486: have considerable difficulty in writing at all, so as to be legible.
LINE 487: When the note was done, I thought it time to retire, and took leave,
LINE 488: after asking if there was anything in the world I could do for him,
LINE 489: little or great, in the way of alleviating his sufferings, and
LINE 490: repairing the injury I had done.
LINE 491: "No," said he; "you have already done much towards it; you have done
LINE 492: more for me than the most skilful physician could do: for you have
LINE 493: relieved my mind of two great burdens—anxiety on my sister's account,
LINE 494: and deep regret upon your own: for I do believe these two sources of
LINE 495: torment have had more effect in working me up into a fever than
LINE 496: anything else; and I am persuaded I shall soon recover now. There is
LINE 497: one more thing you can do for me, and that is, come and see me now and
LINE 498: then—for you see I am very lonely here, and I promise your entrance
LINE 499: shall not be disputed again."
LINE 500: I engaged to do so, and departed with a cordial pressure of the hand. I
LINE 501: posted the letter on my way home, most manfully resisting the
LINE 502: temptation of dropping in a word from myself at the same time.
