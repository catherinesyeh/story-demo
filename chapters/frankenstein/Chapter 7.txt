LINE 1: On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—
LINE 2: "My dear Victor,
LINE 3: "You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
LINE 4: your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
LINE 5: lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But
LINE 6: that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be
LINE 7: your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
LINE 8: behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can
LINE 9: I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
LINE 10: our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
LINE 11: son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
LINE 12: impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
LINE 13: which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
LINE 14: "William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
LINE 15: my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!
LINE 16: "I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
LINE 17: circumstances of the transaction.
LINE 18: "Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
LINE 19: walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
LINE 20: our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
LINE 21: returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
LINE 22: on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until
LINE 23: they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
LINE 24: his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
LINE 25: had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
LINE 26: afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
LINE 27: "This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
LINE 28: until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
LINE 29: returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with
LINE 30: torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
LINE 31: lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
LINE 32: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I
LINE 33: discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and
LINE 34: active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
LINE 35: print of the murder's finger was on his neck.
LINE 36: "He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
LINE 37: countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to
LINE 38: see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
LINE 39: and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
LINE 40: victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my
LINE 41: darling child!'
LINE 42: "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again
LINE 43: lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same
LINE 44: evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
LINE 45: miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and
LINE 46: was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We
LINE 47: have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
LINE 48: are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
LINE 49: "Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps
LINE 50: continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
LINE 51: her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an
LINE 52: additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
LINE 53: Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live
LINE 54: to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
LINE 55: "Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
LINE 56: but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
LINE 57: festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my
LINE 58: friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
LINE 59: with hatred for your enemies.
LINE 60: "Your affectionate and afflicted father,
LINE 61: "Alphonse Frankenstein.
LINE 62: "Geneva, May 12th, 17—."
LINE 63: Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
LINE 64: surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
LINE 65: expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the
LINE 66: table, and covered my face with my hands.
LINE 67: "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
LINE 68: weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,
LINE 69: what has happened?"
LINE 70: I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
LINE 71: room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of
LINE 72: Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
LINE 73: "I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he;
LINE 74: "your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"
LINE 75: "To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses."
LINE 76: During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
LINE 77: he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. "Poor William!" said he,
LINE 78: "dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had
LINE 79: seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
LINE 80: untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp! How
LINE 81: much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little
LINE 82: fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
LINE 83: he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
LINE 84: A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer
LINE 85: be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
LINE 86: survivors."
LINE 87: Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
LINE 88: impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
LINE 89: solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a
LINE 90: cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
LINE 91: My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
LINE 92: to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I
LINE 93: drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
LINE 94: the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through
LINE 95: scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
LINE 96: How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
LINE 97: desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
LINE 98: might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
LINE 99: done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
LINE 100: dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
LINE 101: although I was unable to define them.
LINE 102: I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I
LINE 103: contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
LINE 104: snowy mountains, "the palaces of nature," were not changed. By
LINE 105: degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
LINE 106: towards Geneva.
LINE 107: The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
LINE 108: approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black
LINE 109: sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a
LINE 110: child. "Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
LINE 111: wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
LINE 112: placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"
LINE 113: I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
LINE 114: these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
LINE 115: happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved
LINE 116: country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
LINE 117: beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
LINE 118: lake!
LINE 119: Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also
LINE 120: closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still
LINE 121: more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I
LINE 122: foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human
LINE 123: beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
LINE 124: circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
LINE 125: conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
LINE 126: It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
LINE 127: of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
LINE 128: Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky
LINE 129: was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot
LINE 130: where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the
LINE 131: town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
LINE 132: During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont
LINE 133: Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach
LINE 134: rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
LINE 135: progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
LINE 136: coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
LINE 137: I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
LINE 138: increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
LINE 139: over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of
LINE 140: Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
LINE 141: lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
LINE 142: every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
LINE 143: from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
LINE 144: Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The
LINE 145: most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
LINE 146: lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
LINE 147: Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
LINE 148: darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the
LINE 149: east of the lake.
LINE 150: While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
LINE 151: a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
LINE 152: hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel! this is thy
LINE 153: funeral, this thy dirge!" As I said these words, I perceived in the
LINE 154: gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
LINE 155: fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
LINE 156: illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
LINE 157: gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
LINE 158: to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
LINE 159: dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
LINE 160: shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
LINE 161: idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
LINE 162: chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
LINE 163: passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could
LINE 164: have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not
LINE 165: doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
LINE 166: fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
LINE 167: another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
LINE 168: perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
LINE 169: south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
LINE 170: I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still
LINE 171: continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I
LINE 172: revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
LINE 173: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
LINE 174: the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
LINE 175: now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
LINE 176: was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
LINE 177: depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
LINE 178: murdered my brother?
LINE 179: No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
LINE 180: night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not
LINE 181: feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
LINE 182: scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast
LINE 183: among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
LINE 184: of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
LINE 185: of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
LINE 186: to destroy all that was dear to me.
LINE 187: Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were
LINE 188: open, and I hastened to my father's house. My first thought was to
LINE 189: discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
LINE 190: made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A
LINE 191: being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
LINE 192: midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I
LINE 193: remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
LINE 194: the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
LINE 195: delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that
LINE 196: if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
LINE 197: looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature
LINE 198: of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
LINE 199: as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would
LINE 200: be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
LINE 201: overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and
LINE 202: I resolved to remain silent.
LINE 203: It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I
LINE 204: told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
LINE 205: to attend their usual hour of rising.
LINE 206: Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
LINE 207: stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
LINE 208: departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained
LINE 209: to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
LINE 210: mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father's
LINE 211: desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
LINE 212: by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
LINE 213: but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
LINE 214: sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
LINE 215: tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
LINE 216: entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
LINE 217: "Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he. "Ah! I wish you
LINE 218: had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
LINE 219: delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
LINE 220: alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
LINE 221: sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
LINE 222: Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor
LINE 223: William! he was our darling and our pride!"
LINE 224: Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal
LINE 225: agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the
LINE 226: wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
LINE 227: a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
LINE 228: minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
LINE 229: "She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused
LINE 230: herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
LINE 231: very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—"
LINE 232: "The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
LINE 233: to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
LINE 234: winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he
LINE 235: was free last night!"
LINE 236: "I do not know what you mean," replied my brother, in accents of
LINE 237: wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No
LINE 238: one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
LINE 239: convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit
LINE 240: that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
LINE 241: could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"
LINE 242: "Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is
LINE 243: wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?"
LINE 244: "No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
LINE 245: almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
LINE 246: confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,
LINE 247: leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will
LINE 248: then hear all."
LINE 249: He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William
LINE 250: had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
LINE 251: bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,
LINE 252: happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
LINE 253: murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
LINE 254: had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant
LINE 255: instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
LINE 256: any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
LINE 257: Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl
LINE 258: confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
LINE 259: manner.
LINE 260: This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
LINE 261: earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,
LINE 262: good Justine, is innocent."
LINE 263: At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
LINE 264: on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
LINE 265: after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
LINE 266: some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
LINE 267: "Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
LINE 268: poor William."
LINE 269: "We do also, unfortunately," replied my father, "for indeed I had
LINE 270: rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
LINE 271: depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly."
LINE 272: "My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."
LINE 273: "If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
LINE 274: tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted."
LINE 275: This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
LINE 276: Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
LINE 277: had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
LINE 278: brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to
LINE 279: announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
LINE 280: madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the
LINE 281: creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
LINE 282: existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
LINE 283: which I had let loose upon the world?
LINE 284: We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last
LINE 285: beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
LINE 286: her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
LINE 287: it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
LINE 288: She welcomed me with the greatest affection. "Your arrival, my dear
LINE 289: cousin," said she, "fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some
LINE 290: means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she
LINE 291: be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
LINE 292: upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
LINE 293: lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
LINE 294: love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I
LINE 295: never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;
LINE 296: and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
LINE 297: William."
LINE 298: "She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall
LINE 299: be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
LINE 300: of her acquittal."
LINE 301: "How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
LINE 302: and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to
LINE 303: see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
LINE 304: hopeless and despairing." She wept.
LINE 305: "Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears. If she
LINE 306: is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
LINE 307: activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of
LINE 308: partiality."
