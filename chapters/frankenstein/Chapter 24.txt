LINE 1: My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
LINE 2: swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
LINE 3: endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
LINE 4: allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
LINE 5: delirium or death would have been my portion.
LINE 6: My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I
LINE 7: was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
LINE 8: hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
LINE 9: which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
LINE 10: And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have
LINE 11: traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
LINE 12: which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I
LINE 13: have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon
LINE 14: the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared
LINE 15: not die and leave my adversary in being.
LINE 16: When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
LINE 17: might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,
LINE 18: and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
LINE 19: what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the
LINE 20: entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
LINE 21: reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
LINE 22: graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
LINE 23: were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
LINE 24: scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
LINE 25: observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
LINE 26: cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
LINE 27: mourner.
LINE 28: The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
LINE 29: rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
LINE 30: and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass
LINE 31: and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, "By the
LINE 32: sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
LINE 33: deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
LINE 34: spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
LINE 35: until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
LINE 36: preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
LINE 37: and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
LINE 38: eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
LINE 39: ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
LINE 40: and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
LINE 41: torments me."
LINE 42: I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
LINE 43: that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
LINE 44: the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
LINE 45: I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
LINE 46: laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
LINE 47: it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
LINE 48: Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
LINE 49: destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
LINE 50: was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known
LINE 51: and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
LINE 52: audible whisper, "I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have
LINE 53: determined to live, and I am satisfied."
LINE 54: I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
LINE 55: eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
LINE 56: full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
LINE 57: mortal speed.
LINE 58: I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a
LINE 59: slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The
LINE 60: blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
LINE 61: enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
LINE 62: took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
LINE 63: Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
LINE 64: have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by
LINE 65: this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
LINE 66: who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
LINE 67: left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw
LINE 68: the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering
LINE 69: on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
LINE 70: what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the
LINE 71: least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
LINE 72: and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
LINE 73: followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
LINE 74: extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,
LINE 75: when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
LINE 76: was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The
LINE 77: fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
LINE 78: I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
LINE 79: invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
LINE 80: I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
LINE 81: few drops that revived me, and vanish.
LINE 82: I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon
LINE 83: generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
LINE 84: country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom
LINE 85: seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
LINE 86: path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
LINE 87: by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,
LINE 88: which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
LINE 89: provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
LINE 90: My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
LINE 91: sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most
LINE 92: miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
LINE 93: spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
LINE 94: happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
LINE 95: this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was
LINE 96: sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
LINE 97: friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
LINE 98: countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's
LINE 99: voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
LINE 100: a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
LINE 101: come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
LINE 102: friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
LINE 103: their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
LINE 104: persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
LINE 105: burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
LINE 106: destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
LINE 107: mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
LINE 108: ardent desire of my soul.
LINE 109: What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he
LINE 110: left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
LINE 111: me and instigated my fury. "My reign is not yet
LINE 112: over"—these words were legible in one of these
LINE 113: inscriptions—"you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I
LINE 114: seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
LINE 115: cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if
LINE 116: you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my
LINE 117: enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
LINE 118: hours must you endure until that period shall arrive."
LINE 119: Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,
LINE 120: miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search
LINE 121: until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
LINE 122: Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
LINE 123: reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
LINE 124: As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
LINE 125: cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were
LINE 126: shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
LINE 127: seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
LINE 128: seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
LINE 129: procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
LINE 130: The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One
LINE 131: inscription that he left was in these words: "Prepare! Your toils
LINE 132: only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
LINE 133: upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
LINE 134: hatred."
LINE 135: My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
LINE 136: resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support
LINE 137: me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
LINE 138: until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
LINE 139: of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
LINE 140: south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
LINE 141: its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when
LINE 142: they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with
LINE 143: rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down
LINE 144: and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
LINE 145: safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe,
LINE 146: to meet and grapple with him.
LINE 147: Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
LINE 148: traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the
LINE 149: fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
LINE 150: daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
LINE 151: when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and
LINE 152: I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new
LINE 153: courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
LINE 154: hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
LINE 155: fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,
LINE 156: had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
LINE 157: putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
LINE 158: his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter
LINE 159: food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
LINE 160: numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
LINE 161: night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
LINE 162: journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
LINE 163: conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
LINE 164: ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.
LINE 165: On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
LINE 166: He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless
LINE 167: journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
LINE 168: of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a
LINE 169: genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
LINE 170: that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
LINE 171: returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
LINE 172: After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
LINE 173: round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
LINE 174: I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
LINE 175: the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
LINE 176: departed from land.
LINE 177: I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
LINE 178: misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
LINE 179: burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and
LINE 180: rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
LINE 181: the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But
LINE 182: again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
LINE 183: By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
LINE 184: I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
LINE 185: of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
LINE 186: despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured
LINE 187: her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after
LINE 188: the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
LINE 189: summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
LINE 190: died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
LINE 191: caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to
LINE 192: discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
LINE 193: distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
LINE 194: form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
LINE 195: Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
LINE 196: not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was
LINE 197: dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
LINE 198: oppressed me, I wept aloud.
LINE 199: But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
LINE 200: dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
LINE 201: hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
LINE 202: irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor
LINE 203: did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
LINE 204: time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed
LINE 205: perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I
LINE 206: beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
LINE 207: me.
LINE 208: But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
LINE 209: suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had
LINE 210: ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
LINE 211: the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
LINE 212: and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;
LINE 213: and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
LINE 214: tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few
LINE 215: minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left
LINE 216: drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
LINE 217: thus preparing for me a hideous death.
LINE 218: In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I
LINE 219: myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your
LINE 220: vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
LINE 221: I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
LINE 222: at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
LINE 223: by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
LINE 224: the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,
LINE 225: still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
LINE 226: purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
LINE 227: my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my
LINE 228: vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied
LINE 229: hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.
LINE 230: Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
LINE 231: me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,
LINE 232: swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
LINE 233: and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to
LINE 234: undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
LINE 235: No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
LINE 236: the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
LINE 237: shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
LINE 238: woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent
LINE 239: and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
LINE 240: trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
LINE 241: and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,
LINE 242: Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
LINE 243: thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the
LINE 244: steel aright.
LINE 245: Walton, _in continuation._
LINE 246: August 26th, 17—.
LINE 247: You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
LINE 248: feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
LINE 249: mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
LINE 250: tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
LINE 251: difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes
LINE 252: were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
LINE 253: and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his
LINE 254: countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
LINE 255: tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
LINE 256: volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
LINE 257: of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.
LINE 258: His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
LINE 259: yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
LINE 260: and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
LINE 261: greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
LINE 262: however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!
LINE 263: I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
LINE 264: endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his
LINE 265: creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.
LINE 266: "Are you mad, my friend?" said he. "Or whither does your
LINE 267: senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
LINE 268: world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek
LINE 269: to increase your own."
LINE 270: Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked
LINE 271: to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
LINE 272: but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
LINE 273: with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my narration," said
LINE 274: he, "I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
LINE 275: posterity."
LINE 276: Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
LINE 277: tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my
LINE 278: soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
LINE 279: and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe
LINE 280: him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
LINE 281: every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can
LINE 282: now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
LINE 283: death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
LINE 284: delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
LINE 285: friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
LINE 286: excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
LINE 287: fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
LINE 288: remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
LINE 289: them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
LINE 290: Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
LINE 291: misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays
LINE 292: unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
LINE 293: eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates
LINE 294: a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
LINE 295: without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
LINE 296: of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems
LINE 297: to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
LINE 298: "When younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for
LINE 299: some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
LINE 300: of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
LINE 301: the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
LINE 302: for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
LINE 303: might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
LINE 304: completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
LINE 305: animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But
LINE 306: this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
LINE 307: serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes
LINE 308: are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
LINE 309: chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
LINE 310: analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
LINE 311: conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot
LINE 312: recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
LINE 313: heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
LINE 314: of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
LINE 315: ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
LINE 316: was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency
LINE 317: rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
LINE 318: never, never again to rise."
LINE 319: Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
LINE 320: sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert
LINE 321: seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his
LINE 322: value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
LINE 323: "I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so
LINE 324: miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
LINE 325: affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
LINE 326: man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
LINE 327: where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
LINE 328: the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
LINE 329: minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our
LINE 330: infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
LINE 331: are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
LINE 332: certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
LINE 333: brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
LINE 334: suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
LINE 335: however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
LINE 336: contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
LINE 337: through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
LINE 338: I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
LINE 339: Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
LINE 340: feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
LINE 341: were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
LINE 342: utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
LINE 343: such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
LINE 344: gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die."
LINE 345: My beloved Sister,
LINE 346: September 2d.
LINE 347: I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
LINE 348: doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
LINE 349: it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
LINE 350: threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I
LINE 351: have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
LINE 352: none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our
LINE 353: situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is
LINE 354: terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
LINE 355: through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
LINE 356: And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my
LINE 357: destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and
LINE 358: you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My
LINE 359: beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
LINE 360: in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband
LINE 361: and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!
LINE 362: My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He
LINE 363: endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
LINE 364: which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have
LINE 365: happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
LINE 366: of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel
LINE 367: the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
LINE 368: rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
LINE 369: vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
LINE 370: resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
LINE 371: expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
LINE 372: caused by this despair.
LINE 373: September 5th.
LINE 374: A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
LINE 375: highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
LINE 376: forbear recording it.
LINE 377: We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
LINE 378: of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of
LINE 379: my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
LINE 380: desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
LINE 381: still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
LINE 382: roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
LINE 383: lifelessness.
LINE 384: I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
LINE 385: This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
LINE 386: eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half
LINE 387: a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They
LINE 388: entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his
LINE 389: companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
LINE 390: to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
LINE 391: We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
LINE 392: feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
LINE 393: passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
LINE 394: lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
LINE 395: this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn
LINE 396: promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my
LINE 397: course southwards.
LINE 398: This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived
LINE 399: the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in
LINE 400: possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when
LINE 401: Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
LINE 402: to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
LINE 403: and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,
LINE 404: he said,
LINE 405: "What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,
LINE 406: so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
LINE 407: expedition? "And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was
LINE 408: smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
LINE 409: terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
LINE 410: and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
LINE 411: these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
LINE 412: was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the
LINE 413: benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
LINE 414: who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
LINE 415: behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
LINE 416: mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
LINE 417: to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
LINE 418: peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
LINE 419: firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
LINE 420: thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
LINE 421: yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
LINE 422: purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
LINE 423: hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
LINE 424: shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
LINE 425: marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
LINE 426: who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe."
LINE 427: He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
LINE 428: in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
LINE 429: you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were
LINE 430: unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had
LINE 431: been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
LINE 432: desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage
LINE 433: would return.
LINE 434: They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
LINE 435: almost deprived of life.
LINE 436: How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than
LINE 437: return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my
LINE 438: fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
LINE 439: willingly continue to endure their present hardships.
LINE 440: September 7th.
LINE 441: The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
LINE 442: Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
LINE 443: ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess
LINE 444: to bear this injustice with patience.
LINE 445: September 12th.
LINE 446: It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility
LINE 447: and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these
LINE 448: bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
LINE 449: towards England and towards you, I will not despond.
LINE 450: September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
LINE 451: at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
LINE 452: in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
LINE 453: attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
LINE 454: such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked
LINE 455: behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
LINE 456: the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
LINE 457: free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
LINE 458: country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
LINE 459: loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
LINE 460: cause of the tumult. "They shout," I said, "because they
LINE 461: will soon return to England."
LINE 462: "Do you, then, really return?"
LINE 463: "Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them
LINE 464: unwillingly to danger, and I must return."
LINE 465: "Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but
LINE 466: mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but
LINE 467: surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
LINE 468: sufficient strength." Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
LINE 469: bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.
LINE 470: It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was
LINE 471: entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
LINE 472: difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing
LINE 473: draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he
LINE 474: told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
LINE 475: His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat
LINE 476: by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
LINE 477: presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
LINE 478: said, "Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
LINE 479: soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
LINE 480: not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
LINE 481: hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
LINE 482: justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I
LINE 483: have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
LINE 484: In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
LINE 485: bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
LINE 486: well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
LINE 487: that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
LINE 488: my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
LINE 489: misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
LINE 490: create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity
LINE 491: and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
LINE 492: beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
LINE 493: know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may
LINE 494: render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was
LINE 495: mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I
LINE 496: asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,
LINE 497: when I am only induced by reason and virtue.
LINE 498: "Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
LINE 499: this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
LINE 500: little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these
LINE 501: points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I
LINE 502: leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
LINE 503: approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I
LINE 504: may still be misled by passion.
LINE 505: "That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
LINE 506: other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
LINE 507: only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of
LINE 508: the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,
LINE 509: Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
LINE 510: be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
LINE 511: science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been
LINE 512: blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed."
LINE 513: His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
LINE 514: effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he
LINE 515: attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
LINE 516: his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
LINE 517: away from his lips.
LINE 518: Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
LINE 519: glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the
LINE 520: depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and
LINE 521: feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
LINE 522: disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
LINE 523: consolation.
LINE 524: I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the
LINE 525: breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there
LINE 526: is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
LINE 527: where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.
LINE 528: Good night, my sister.
LINE 529: Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
LINE 530: remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
LINE 531: it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
LINE 532: final and wonderful catastrophe.
LINE 533: I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
LINE 534: friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to
LINE 535: describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
LINE 536: proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
LINE 537: locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
LINE 538: apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
LINE 539: approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
LINE 540: towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
LINE 541: such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
LINE 542: endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
LINE 543: I called on him to stay.
LINE 544: He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
LINE 545: lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
LINE 546: every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
LINE 547: uncontrollable passion.
LINE 548: "That is also my victim!" he exclaimed. "In his murder my
LINE 549: crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
LINE 550: close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it
LINE 551: avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
LINE 552: by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer
LINE 553: me."
LINE 554: His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
LINE 555: me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
LINE 556: enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
LINE 557: approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his
LINE 558: face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
LINE 559: attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
LINE 560: continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
LINE 561: gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
LINE 562: "Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you
LINE 563: had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
LINE 564: before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
LINE 565: Frankenstein would yet have lived."
LINE 566: "And do you dream?" said the dæmon. "Do you think that I was then
LINE 567: dead to agony and remorse? He," he continued, pointing to the corpse,
LINE 568: "he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the
LINE 569: ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
LINE 570: lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me
LINE 571: on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the
LINE 572: groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be
LINE 573: susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
LINE 574: and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
LINE 575: torture such as you cannot even imagine.
LINE 576: "After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
LINE 577: and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
LINE 578: abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
LINE 579: my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
LINE 580: happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
LINE 581: he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
LINE 582: indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
LINE 583: indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I
LINE 584: recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I
LINE 585: knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
LINE 586: slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
LINE 587: disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had
LINE 588: cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
LINE 589: despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no
LINE 590: choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
LINE 591: chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
LINE 592: passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"
LINE 593: I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
LINE 594: to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
LINE 595: persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
LINE 596: friend, indignation was rekindled within me. "Wretch!" I said.
LINE 597: "It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
LINE 598: have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
LINE 599: consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
LINE 600: If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
LINE 601: he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you
LINE 602: feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
LINE 603: from your power."
LINE 604: "Oh, it is not thus—not thus," interrupted the being.
LINE 605: "Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
LINE 606: be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
LINE 607: No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
LINE 608: virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
LINE 609: overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
LINE 610: become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
LINE 611: bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
LINE 612: content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
LINE 613: well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
LINE 614: my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
LINE 615: I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
LINE 616: love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
LINE 617: nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
LINE 618: degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
LINE 619: malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
LINE 620: frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
LINE 621: creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
LINE 622: visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
LINE 623: fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
LINE 624: had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
LINE 625: "You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
LINE 626: crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
LINE 627: he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
LINE 628: wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
LINE 629: not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
LINE 630: I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no
LINE 631: injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
LINE 632: humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
LINE 633: friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
LINE 634: who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
LINE 635: and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
LINE 636: abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
LINE 637: blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
LINE 638: "But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and
LINE 639: the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
LINE 640: death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have
LINE 641: devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
LINE 642: admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
LINE 643: irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
LINE 644: your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the
LINE 645: hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
LINE 646: imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
LINE 647: will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
LINE 648: "Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work
LINE 649: is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to
LINE 650: consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
LINE 651: but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
LINE 652: sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
LINE 653: thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
LINE 654: collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
LINE 655: remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
LINE 656: create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the
LINE 657: agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
LINE 658: unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
LINE 659: more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no
LINE 660: longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,
LINE 661: feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
LINE 662: happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
LINE 663: opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
LINE 664: rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
LINE 665: me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by
LINE 666: crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
LINE 667: death?
LINE 668: "Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
LINE 669: eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
LINE 670: and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
LINE 671: satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
LINE 672: didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
LINE 673: and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
LINE 674: and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
LINE 675: that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
LINE 676: thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
LINE 677: wounds until death shall close them for ever.
LINE 678: "But soon," he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I
LINE 679: shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning
LINE 680: miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
LINE 681: exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration
LINE 682: will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
LINE 683: will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
LINE 684: Farewell."
LINE 685: He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
LINE 686: which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and
LINE 687: lost in darkness and distance.

LINE 914: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
LINE 915: from people in all walks of life.
LINE 916: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
LINE 917: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
LINE 918: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
LINE 919: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

LINE 922: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 923: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

LINE 937: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
LINE 938: Literary Archive Foundation
LINE 939: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
LINE 940: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
LINE 941: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
LINE 942: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
LINE 943: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
LINE 944: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
LINE 945: status with the IRS.
LINE 946: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
LINE 947: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
LINE 948: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
LINE 949: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
LINE 950: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
LINE 951: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
LINE 952: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
LINE 953: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 954: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
LINE 955: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
LINE 956: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
LINE 957: approach us with offers to donate.
LINE 958: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
LINE 959: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
LINE 960: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
LINE 961: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
LINE 962: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
LINE 963: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
LINE 964: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 965: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
LINE 966: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
LINE 967: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
LINE 968: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
LINE 969: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
LINE 970: volunteer support.
LINE 971: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
LINE 972: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
LINE 973: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
LINE 974: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
LINE 975: edition.
LINE 976: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
LINE 977: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 978: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
LINE 979: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 980: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
LINE 981: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
