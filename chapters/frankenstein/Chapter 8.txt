LINE 1: We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to
LINE 2: commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
LINE 3: as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of
LINE 4: this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to
LINE 5: be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
LINE 6: cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of
LINE 7: innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
LINE 8: aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
LINE 9: Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
LINE 10: to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
LINE 11: ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I
LINE 12: have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
LINE 13: was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
LINE 14: been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
LINE 15: exculpated her who suffered through me.
LINE 16: The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and
LINE 17: her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
LINE 18: feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in
LINE 19: innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
LINE 20: thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
LINE 21: excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
LINE 22: imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She
LINE 23: was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
LINE 24: her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
LINE 25: worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the
LINE 26: court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
LINE 27: seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
LINE 28: recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
LINE 29: her utter guiltlessness.
LINE 30: The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
LINE 31: charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
LINE 32: against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
LINE 33: of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on
LINE 34: which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
LINE 35: perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
LINE 36: murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she
LINE 37: did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
LINE 38: and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
LINE 39: o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
LINE 40: replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
LINE 41: if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she
LINE 42: fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The
LINE 43: picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
LINE 44: and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
LINE 45: which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
LINE 46: his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
LINE 47: Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her
LINE 48: countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
LINE 49: expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
LINE 50: desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
LINE 51: although variable voice.
LINE 52: "God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent. But I
LINE 53: do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence
LINE 54: on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
LINE 55: against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my
LINE 56: judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
LINE 57: doubtful or suspicious."
LINE 58: She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
LINE 59: the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
LINE 60: house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from
LINE 61: Geneva. On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked
LINE 62: her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was
LINE 63: alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
LINE 64: when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
LINE 65: several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
LINE 66: unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most
LINE 67: of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
LINE 68: she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
LINE 69: It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
LINE 70: to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
LINE 71: it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when
LINE 72: questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
LINE 73: a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
LINE 74: Concerning the picture she could give no account.
LINE 75: "I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and
LINE 76: fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of
LINE 77: explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left
LINE 78: to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
LINE 79: placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no
LINE 80: enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
LINE 81: wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity
LINE 82: afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the
LINE 83: jewel, to part with it again so soon?
LINE 84: "I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
LINE 85: hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
LINE 86: character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
LINE 87: guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
LINE 88: innocence."
LINE 89: Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
LINE 90: they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
LINE 91: supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
LINE 92: forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
LINE 93: dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
LINE 94: when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
LINE 95: the court.
LINE 96: "I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who
LINE 97: was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
LINE 98: with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may
LINE 99: therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
LINE 100: when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
LINE 101: pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
LINE 102: know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived
LINE 103: in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
LINE 104: two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
LINE 105: benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
LINE 106: her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
LINE 107: attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
LINE 108: the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
LINE 109: uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
LINE 110: warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
LINE 111: most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
LINE 112: notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
LINE 113: on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to
LINE 114: the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
LINE 115: I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
LINE 116: her."
LINE 117: A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful
LINE 118: appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
LINE 119: favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
LINE 120: renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She
LINE 121: herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own
LINE 122: agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed
LINE 123: in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a
LINE 124: minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
LINE 125: betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the
LINE 126: horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
LINE 127: the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
LINE 128: I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did
LINE 129: not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
LINE 130: remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
LINE 131: I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
LINE 132: the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
LINE 133: question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
LINE 134: visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine
LINE 135: was condemned.
LINE 136: I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before
LINE 137: experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
LINE 138: them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
LINE 139: heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I
LINE 140: addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
LINE 141: "That evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a
LINE 142: case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
LINE 143: condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
LINE 144: decisive."
LINE 145: This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
LINE 146: my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would
LINE 147: believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I
LINE 148: hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
LINE 149: "My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all
LINE 150: judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
LINE 151: should escape. But she has confessed."
LINE 152: This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
LINE 153: Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she. "How shall I
LINE 154: ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as
LINE 155: my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
LINE 156: Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
LINE 157: committed a murder."
LINE 158: Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
LINE 159: cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
LINE 160: judgment and feelings to decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth,
LINE 161: "I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany
LINE 162: me; I cannot go alone." The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
LINE 163: I could not refuse.
LINE 164: We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some
LINE 165: straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
LINE 166: her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
LINE 167: her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My
LINE 168: cousin wept also.
LINE 169: "Oh, Justine!" said she. "Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
LINE 170: I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I
LINE 171: was not so miserable as I am now."
LINE 172: "And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also
LINE 173: join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?" Her
LINE 174: voice was suffocated with sobs.
LINE 175: "Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel,
LINE 176: if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you
LINE 177: guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had
LINE 178: yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
LINE 179: assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
LINE 180: moment, but your own confession."
LINE 181: "I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might
LINE 182: obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
LINE 183: all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was
LINE 184: condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
LINE 185: until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I
LINE 186: was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
LINE 187: I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
LINE 188: on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
LINE 189: In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
LINE 190: miserable."
LINE 191: She paused, weeping, and then continued, "I thought with horror, my
LINE 192: sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed
LINE 193: aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
LINE 194: of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
LINE 195: Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in
LINE 196: heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I
LINE 197: am to suffer ignominy and death."
LINE 198: "Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
LINE 199: Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I
LINE 200: will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony
LINE 201: hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!
LINE 202: You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
LINE 203: No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune."
LINE 204: Justine shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said;
LINE 205: "that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
LINE 206: endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
LINE 207: me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
LINE 208: fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
LINE 209: the will of heaven!"
LINE 210: During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
LINE 211: where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!
LINE 212: Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
LINE 213: the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
LINE 214: deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
LINE 215: uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When
LINE 216: she saw who it was, she approached me and said, "Dear sir, you are very
LINE 217: kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?"
LINE 218: I could not answer. "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more
LINE 219: convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you
LINE 220: had confessed, he did not credit it."
LINE 221: "I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest
LINE 222: gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is
LINE 223: the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than
LINE 224: half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my
LINE 225: innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin."
LINE 226: Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
LINE 227: gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
LINE 228: never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
LINE 229: consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
LINE 230: the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
LINE 231: moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and
LINE 232: despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
LINE 233: me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with
LINE 234: Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear
LINE 235: herself away. "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I
LINE 236: cannot live in this world of misery."
LINE 237: Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
LINE 238: repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice
LINE 239: of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
LINE 240: my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
LINE 241: preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
LINE 242: suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so."
LINE 243: And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence
LINE 244: failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
LINE 245: criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant
LINE 246: appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers
LINE 247: and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
LINE 248: avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
LINE 249: but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She
LINE 250: perished on the scaffold as a murderess!
LINE 251: From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
LINE 252: voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my
LINE 253: father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
LINE 254: the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
LINE 255: are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
LINE 256: the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
LINE 257: Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
LINE 258: who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
LINE 259: thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
LINE 260: countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
LINE 261: in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
LINE 262: his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
LINE 263: pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
LINE 264: Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
LINE 265: I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and
LINE 266: Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
