LINE 1: I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside
LINE 2: the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
LINE 3: with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
LINE 4: barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
LINE 5: me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
LINE 6: scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
LINE 7: presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
LINE 8: waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
LINE 9: avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
LINE 10: accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
LINE 11: was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
LINE 12: their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
LINE 13: greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me
LINE 14: from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
LINE 15: grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they
LINE 16: diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
LINE 17: last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
LINE 18: waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
LINE 19: had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the
LINE 20: unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
LINE 21: and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all
LINE 22: gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
LINE 23: Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
LINE 24: soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
LINE 25: thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
LINE 26: summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
LINE 27: mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
LINE 28: in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was
LINE 29: brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
LINE 30: Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
LINE 31: and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
LINE 32: It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
LINE 33: soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
LINE 34: The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
LINE 35: effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
LINE 36: cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
LINE 37: acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
LINE 38: solitary grandeur of the scene.
LINE 39: The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
LINE 40: windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
LINE 41: mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots
LINE 42: the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
LINE 43: broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
LINE 44: leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
LINE 45: other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
LINE 46: of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
LINE 47: particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
LINE 48: in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
LINE 49: destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or
LINE 50: luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
LINE 51: I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
LINE 52: which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
LINE 53: mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
LINE 54: poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
LINE 55: received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of
LINE 56: sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
LINE 57: them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,
LINE 58: thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
LINE 59: every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
LINE 60: convey to us.
LINE 61: We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
LINE 62: We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
LINE 63: We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
LINE 64: Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
LINE 65: It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
LINE 66: The path of its departure still is free.
LINE 67: Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
LINE 68: Nought may endure but mutability!
LINE 69: It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some
LINE 70: time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
LINE 71: both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated
LINE 72: the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very
LINE 73: uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
LINE 74: interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a
LINE 75: league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The
LINE 76: opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I
LINE 77: now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
LINE 78: and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
LINE 79: of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,
LINE 80: or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
LINE 81: whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering
LINE 82: peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
LINE 83: before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
LINE 84: "Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
LINE 85: beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
LINE 86: away from the joys of life."
LINE 87: As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
LINE 88: advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the
LINE 89: crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
LINE 90: stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was
LINE 91: troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
LINE 92: but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I
LINE 93: perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
LINE 94: that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and
LINE 95: horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
LINE 96: mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
LINE 97: combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
LINE 98: rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
LINE 99: observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
LINE 100: and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
LINE 101: detestation and contempt.
LINE 102: "Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me? And do
LINE 103: not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
LINE 104: Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,
LINE 105: oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
LINE 106: those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!"
LINE 107: "I expected this reception," said the dæmon. "All men hate the
LINE 108: wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
LINE 109: living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
LINE 110: to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
LINE 111: one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
LINE 112: Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of
LINE 113: mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and
LINE 114: you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it
LINE 115: be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends."
LINE 116: "Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too
LINE 117: mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with
LINE 118: your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I
LINE 119: so negligently bestowed."
LINE 120: My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
LINE 121: feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
LINE 122: He easily eluded me and said,
LINE 123: "Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
LINE 124: on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
LINE 125: increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
LINE 126: anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made
LINE 127: me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
LINE 128: joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in
LINE 129: opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
LINE 130: docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
LINE 131: the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
LINE 132: other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
LINE 133: clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;
LINE 134: I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
LINE 135: drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
LINE 136: alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made
LINE 137: me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."
LINE 138: "Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you
LINE 139: and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
LINE 140: in which one must fall."
LINE 141: "How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
LINE 142: favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
LINE 143: compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
LINE 144: with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my
LINE 145: creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
LINE 146: who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and
LINE 147: dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
LINE 148: caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
LINE 149: only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they
LINE 150: are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind
LINE 151: knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
LINE 152: my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep
LINE 153: no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my
LINE 154: wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
LINE 155: them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
LINE 156: not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
LINE 157: swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be
LINE 158: moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard
LINE 159: that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
LINE 160: But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
LINE 161: are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen
LINE 162: to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
LINE 163: a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the
LINE 164: eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
LINE 165: and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."
LINE 166: "Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances of
LINE 167: which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and
LINE 168: author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
LINE 169: light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
LINE 170: You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power
LINE 171: to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from
LINE 172: the sight of your detested form."
LINE 173: "Thus I relieve thee, my creator," he said, and placed his hated hands
LINE 174: before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; "thus I take from
LINE 175: thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant
LINE 176: me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this
LINE 177: from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
LINE 178: this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
LINE 179: the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
LINE 180: to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
LINE 181: world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,
LINE 182: whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
LINE 183: life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
LINE 184: your own speedy ruin."
LINE 185: As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart
LINE 186: was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
LINE 187: various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
LINE 188: his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
LINE 189: resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
LINE 190: brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
LINE 191: For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
LINE 192: his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
LINE 193: complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with
LINE 194: his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
LINE 195: rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
LINE 196: entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
LINE 197: heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating
LINE 198: myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
LINE 199: his tale.
