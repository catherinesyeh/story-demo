LINE 1: I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
LINE 2: rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
LINE 3: remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
LINE 4: labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
LINE 5: to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
LINE 6: consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was
LINE 7: engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
LINE 8: barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
LINE 9: remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was
LINE 10: alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
LINE 11: mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
LINE 12: sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
LINE 13: had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
LINE 14: reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
LINE 15: creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
LINE 16: loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
LINE 17: for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn
LINE 18: with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
LINE 19: and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
LINE 20: deserted by one of his own species.
LINE 21: Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
LINE 22: yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
LINE 23: thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
LINE 24: the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
LINE 25: condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,
LINE 26: to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved
LINE 27: by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by
LINE 28: his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
LINE 29: promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
LINE 30: as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
LINE 31: the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
LINE 32: I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
LINE 33: the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin
LINE 34: wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
LINE 35: which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
LINE 36: had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
LINE 37: and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
LINE 38: fulfilment of my promise.
LINE 39: As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
LINE 40: malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my
LINE 41: promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
LINE 42: tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me
LINE 43: destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
LINE 44: happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
LINE 45: I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
LINE 46: heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I
LINE 47: sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
LINE 48: the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
LINE 49: terrible reveries.
LINE 50: Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
LINE 51: it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
LINE 52: reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone
LINE 53: specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
LINE 54: of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
LINE 55: although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
LINE 56: was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
LINE 57: person landed close to my house.
LINE 58: In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
LINE 59: endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
LINE 60: presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
LINE 61: dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation
LINE 62: of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
LINE 63: endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
LINE 64: Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
LINE 65: opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he
LINE 66: approached me and said in a smothered voice,
LINE 67: "You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
LINE 68: intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;
LINE 69: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
LINE 70: its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many
LINE 71: months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have
LINE 72: endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
LINE 73: hopes?"
LINE 74: "Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like
LINE 75: yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness."
LINE 76: "Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
LINE 77: unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe
LINE 78: yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
LINE 79: day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;
LINE 80: obey!"
LINE 81: "The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
LINE 82: arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
LINE 83: they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
LINE 84: vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose
LINE 85: delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your
LINE 86: words will only exasperate my rage."
LINE 87: The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
LINE 88: impotence of anger. "Shall each man," cried he, "find a
LINE 89: wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had
LINE 90: feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
LINE 91: Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,
LINE 92: and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
LINE 93: ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my
LINE 94: wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge
LINE 95: remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but
LINE 96: first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
LINE 97: misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with
LINE 98: the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall
LINE 99: repent of the injuries you inflict."
LINE 100: "Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
LINE 101: I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend
LINE 102: beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable."
LINE 103: "It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
LINE 104: wedding-night."
LINE 105: I started forward and exclaimed, "Villain! Before you sign my
LINE 106: death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."
LINE 107: I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
LINE 108: precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
LINE 109: across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
LINE 110: waves.
LINE 111: All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to
LINE 112: pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I
LINE 113: walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
LINE 114: conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not
LINE 115: followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
LINE 116: to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
LINE 117: to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
LINE 118: And then I thought again of his words—"_I will be with you on
LINE 119: your wedding-night._" That, then, was the period fixed for the
LINE 120: fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
LINE 121: extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
LINE 122: thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
LINE 123: should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
LINE 124: had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
LINE 125: before my enemy without a bitter struggle.
LINE 126: The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
LINE 127: calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
LINE 128: the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last
LINE 129: night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I
LINE 130: almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
LINE 131: creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I
LINE 132: desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
LINE 133: but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to
LINE 134: be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
LINE 135: dæmon whom I had myself created.
LINE 136: I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
LINE 137: loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the
LINE 138: sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
LINE 139: sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
LINE 140: were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep
LINE 141: into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
LINE 142: if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
LINE 143: reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
LINE 144: words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
LINE 145: like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.
LINE 146: The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
LINE 147: appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
LINE 148: fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
LINE 149: it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
LINE 150: join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
LINE 151: he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
LINE 152: his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
LINE 153: Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
LINE 154: his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
LINE 155: conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
LINE 156: my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to
LINE 157: leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
LINE 158: southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
LINE 159: I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
LINE 160: Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered
LINE 161: to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
LINE 162: must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
LINE 163: handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next
LINE 164: morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
LINE 165: of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
LINE 166: destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
LINE 167: mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and
LINE 168: then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments
LINE 169: out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
LINE 170: work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly
LINE 171: put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
LINE 172: up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
LINE 173: meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
LINE 174: chemical apparatus.
LINE 175: Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
LINE 176: in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had
LINE 177: before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
LINE 178: whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
LINE 179: had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
LINE 180: clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
LINE 181: to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
LINE 182: reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in
LINE 183: my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
LINE 184: would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
LINE 185: banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
LINE 186: conclusion.
LINE 187: Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
LINE 188: basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
LINE 189: The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
LINE 190: but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a
LINE 191: dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
LINE 192: fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
LINE 193: suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
LINE 194: darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
LINE 195: as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but
LINE 196: the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
LINE 197: rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
LINE 198: that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
LINE 199: direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
LINE 200: moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its
LINE 201: keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I
LINE 202: slept soundly.
LINE 203: I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
LINE 204: found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and
LINE 205: the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found
LINE 206: that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
LINE 207: which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
LINE 208: that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
LINE 209: water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
LINE 210: confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me
LINE 211: and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
LINE 212: world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
LINE 213: wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
LINE 214: the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already
LINE 215: been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
LINE 216: my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
LINE 217: that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
LINE 218: sea; it was to be my grave. "Fiend," I exclaimed, "your
LINE 219: task is already fulfilled!" I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
LINE 220: of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
LINE 221: sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
LINE 222: despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
LINE 223: closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
LINE 224: Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
LINE 225: horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
LINE 226: free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick
LINE 227: and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
LINE 228: land towards the south.
LINE 229: Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured
LINE 230: for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
LINE 231: warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
LINE 232: How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
LINE 233: of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
LINE 234: part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a
LINE 235: wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
LINE 236: the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
LINE 237: suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I
LINE 238: carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at
LINE 239: length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of
LINE 240: extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
LINE 241: where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
LINE 242: me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
LINE 243: harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
LINE 244: escape.
LINE 245: As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
LINE 246: people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my
LINE 247: appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
LINE 248: together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
LINE 249: a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
LINE 250: spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. "My
LINE 251: good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
LINE 252: this town and inform me where I am?"
LINE 253: "You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a hoarse voice.
LINE 254: "Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
LINE 255: but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."
LINE 256: I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
LINE 257: stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
LINE 258: angry countenances of his companions. "Why do you answer me so
LINE 259: roughly?" I replied. "Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
LINE 260: receive strangers so inhospitably."
LINE 261: "I do not know," said the man, "what the custom of the
LINE 262: English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains."
LINE 263: While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly
LINE 264: increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
LINE 265: annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but
LINE 266: no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
LINE 267: crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
LINE 268: approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Come, sir, you must
LINE 269: follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself."
LINE 270: "Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not
LINE 271: this a free country?"
LINE 272: "Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,
LINE 273: and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
LINE 274: found murdered here last night."
LINE 275: This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;
LINE 276: that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence
LINE 277: and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from
LINE 278: fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic
LINE 279: to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
LINE 280: apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that
LINE 281: was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
LINE 282: all fear of ignominy or death.
LINE 283: I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
LINE 284: the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
LINE 285: recollection.
