LINE 1: London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
LINE 2: months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the
LINE 3: intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
LINE 4: time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally
LINE 5: occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
LINE 6: completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
LINE 7: introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
LINE 8: distinguished natural philosophers.
LINE 9: If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
LINE 10: it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
LINE 11: come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of
LINE 12: the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
LINE 13: was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
LINE 14: could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
LINE 15: Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
LINE 16: peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
LINE 17: my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
LINE 18: fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
LINE 19: Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
LINE 20: my soul with anguish.
LINE 21: But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
LINE 22: and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of
LINE 23: manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
LINE 24: instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long
LINE 25: had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
LINE 26: in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
LINE 27: taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
LINE 28: European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the
LINE 29: execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his
LINE 30: enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this
LINE 31: as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
LINE 32: natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
LINE 33: any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
LINE 34: alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also
LINE 35: began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
LINE 36: was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
LINE 37: on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
LINE 38: anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
LINE 39: to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
LINE 40: After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
LINE 41: Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
LINE 42: beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
LINE 43: allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
LINE 44: where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,
LINE 45: although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
LINE 46: all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
LINE 47: We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
LINE 48: February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
LINE 49: north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
LINE 50: intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
LINE 51: Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
LINE 52: this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and
LINE 53: the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
LINE 54: obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
LINE 55: We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
LINE 56: Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us
LINE 57: mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
LINE 58: stately deer were all novelties to us.
LINE 59: From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds
LINE 60: were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
LINE 61: there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles
LINE 62: I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,
LINE 63: after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
LINE 64: Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his
LINE 65: companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
LINE 66: son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
LINE 67: might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
LINE 68: dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these
LINE 69: feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
LINE 70: the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
LINE 71: The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
LINE 72: magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
LINE 73: of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
LINE 74: which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
LINE 75: domes, embosomed among aged trees.
LINE 76: I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
LINE 77: memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed
LINE 78: for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never
LINE 79: visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
LINE 80: is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
LINE 81: the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
LINE 82: elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
LINE 83: entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
LINE 84: I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
LINE 85: pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
LINE 86: We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
LINE 87: and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
LINE 88: animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery
LINE 89: were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
LINE 90: themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
LINE 91: field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated
LINE 92: from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
LINE 93: of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
LINE 94: and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
LINE 95: and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
LINE 96: into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
LINE 97: miserable self.
LINE 98: We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
LINE 99: place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village
LINE 100: resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
LINE 101: everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
LINE 102: distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
LINE 103: native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
LINE 104: of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
LINE 105: manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name
LINE 106: made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit
LINE 107: Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
LINE 108: From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
LINE 109: Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
LINE 110: Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
LINE 111: northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
LINE 112: rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
LINE 113: made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
LINE 114: happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
LINE 115: mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
LINE 116: in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
LINE 117: imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
LINE 118: inferiors. "I could pass my life here," said he to me; "and among
LINE 119: these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine."
LINE 120: But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain
LINE 121: amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
LINE 122: when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
LINE 123: that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
LINE 124: engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
LINE 125: We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
LINE 126: and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
LINE 127: of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
LINE 128: to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my
LINE 129: promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon's
LINE 130: disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
LINE 131: on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
LINE 132: from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
LINE 133: for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
LINE 134: miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
LINE 135: saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
LINE 136: read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend
LINE 137: followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
LINE 138: When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
LINE 139: but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
LINE 140: his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
LINE 141: consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed
LINE 142: drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
LINE 143: I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
LINE 144: have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
LINE 145: as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
LINE 146: But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic
LINE 147: castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur's
LINE 148: Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for
LINE 149: the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was
LINE 150: impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
LINE 151: We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and
LINE 152: along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
LINE 153: But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
LINE 154: their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
LINE 155: accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
LINE 156: alone. "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our
LINE 157: rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
LINE 158: my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
LINE 159: time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
LINE 160: congenial to your own temper."
LINE 161: Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
LINE 162: remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. "I had rather be with
LINE 163: you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
LINE 164: people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,
LINE 165: that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
LINE 166: your absence."
LINE 167: Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
LINE 168: Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the
LINE 169: monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have
LINE 170: finished, that he might receive his companion.
LINE 171: With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
LINE 172: the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
LINE 173: fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
LINE 174: continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
LINE 175: affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
LINE 176: inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
LINE 177: gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
LINE 178: indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
LINE 179: the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
LINE 180: On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
LINE 181: these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two
LINE 182: rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
LINE 183: penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
LINE 184: door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
LINE 185: furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
LINE 186: occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
LINE 187: benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at
LINE 188: and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
LINE 189: which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
LINE 190: of men.
LINE 191: In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
LINE 192: when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
LINE 193: listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a
LINE 194: monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was
LINE 195: far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills
LINE 196: are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
LINE 197: plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
LINE 198: troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
LINE 199: infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
LINE 200: In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
LINE 201: as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
LINE 202: irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
LINE 203: laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night
LINE 204: in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in
LINE 205: which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of
LINE 206: enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
LINE 207: mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
LINE 208: were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in
LINE 209: cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
LINE 210: Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
LINE 211: a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
LINE 212: the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
LINE 213: grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my
LINE 214: persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
LINE 215: to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much
LINE 216: dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
LINE 217: creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
LINE 218: In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably
LINE 219: advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
LINE 220: hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was
LINE 221: intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
LINE 222: in my bosom.
