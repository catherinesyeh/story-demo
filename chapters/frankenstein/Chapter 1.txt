LINE 1: You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
LINE 2: commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
LINE 3: forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
LINE 4: my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
LINE 5: of my undertaking.
LINE 6: I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
LINE 7: Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
LINE 8: braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
LINE 9: feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
LINE 10: which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
LINE 11: Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
LINE 12: and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
LINE 13: frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
LINE 14: region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
LINE 15: visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
LINE 16: perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put
LINE 17: some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;
LINE 18: and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
LINE 19: wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
LINE 20: globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
LINE 21: phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
LINE 22: solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
LINE 23: may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
LINE 24: regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
LINE 25: voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I
LINE 26: shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
LINE 27: never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
LINE 28: the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
LINE 29: conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
LINE 30: laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
LINE 31: boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
LINE 32: native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
LINE 33: cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
LINE 34: mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
LINE 35: to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
LINE 36: requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
LINE 37: all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
LINE 38: These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
LINE 39: letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
LINE 40: to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
LINE 41: a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
LINE 42: eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
LINE 43: have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
LINE 44: been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
LINE 45: through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a
LINE 46: history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
LINE 47: whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library. My education was neglected,
LINE 48: yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study
LINE 49: day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
LINE 50: I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction
LINE 51: had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
LINE 52: These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
LINE 53: whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also
LINE 54: became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
LINE 55: I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
LINE 56: names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well
LINE 57: acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
LINE 58: But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
LINE 59: thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
LINE 60: Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I
LINE 61: can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
LINE 62: great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I
LINE 63: accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;
LINE 64: I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
LINE 65: worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
LINE 66: nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
LINE 67: branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
LINE 68: the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an
LINE 69: under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I
LINE 70: must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
LINE 71: dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
LINE 72: earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.
LINE 73: And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
LINE 74: My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
LINE 75: every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
LINE 76: voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is
LINE 77: firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am
LINE 78: about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
LINE 79: will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits
LINE 80: of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.
LINE 81: This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
LINE 82: quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
LINE 83: my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The
LINE 84: cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have
LINE 85: already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
LINE 86: deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
LINE 87: prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no
LINE 88: ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and
LINE 89: Archangel.
LINE 90: I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
LINE 91: intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
LINE 92: insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
LINE 93: among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to
LINE 94: sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how
LINE 95: can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
LINE 96: will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,
LINE 97: or never.
LINE 98: Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,
LINE 99: and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
LINE 100: love and kindness.
LINE 101: Your affectionate brother,
LINE 102: R. Walton
LINE 103: Letter 2
LINE 104: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
LINE 105: Archangel, 28th March, 17—.
LINE 106: How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
LINE 107: Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a
LINE 108: vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have
LINE 109: already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly
LINE 110: possessed of dauntless courage.
LINE 111: But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
LINE 112: absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no
LINE 113: friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
LINE 114: will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
LINE 115: one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts
LINE 116: to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
LINE 117: feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
LINE 118: eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
LINE 119: bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
LINE 120: courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
LINE 121: tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
LINE 122: friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution
LINE 123: and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
LINE 124: that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
LINE 125: on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages.
LINE 126: At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
LINE 127: country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
LINE 128: most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
LINE 129: necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
LINE 130: country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
LINE 131: schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my
LINE 132: daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
LINE 133: call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense
LINE 134: enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
LINE 135: endeavour to regulate my mind.
LINE 136: Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the
LINE 137: wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
LINE 138: some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
LINE 139: rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
LINE 140: and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
LINE 141: more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
LINE 142: Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
LINE 143: unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
LINE 144: humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
LINE 145: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist
LINE 146: in my enterprise.
LINE 147: The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
LINE 148: ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
LINE 149: circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
LINE 150: me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
LINE 151: spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
LINE 152: groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
LINE 153: the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
LINE 154: necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
LINE 155: of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
LINE 156: myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
LINE 157: of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
LINE 158: happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
LINE 159: a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
LINE 160: sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw
LINE 161: his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
LINE 162: tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
LINE 163: confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
LINE 164: and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend
LINE 165: reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
LINE 166: instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
LINE 167: money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
LINE 168: bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
LINE 169: prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
LINE 170: woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
LINE 171: man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
LINE 172: when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
LINE 173: until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
LINE 174: inclinations. "What a noble fellow!" you will exclaim. He is
LINE 175: so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
LINE 176: of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
LINE 177: the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
LINE 178: otherwise he would command.
LINE 179: Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can
LINE 180: conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
LINE 181: wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
LINE 182: is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
LINE 183: winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
LINE 184: is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
LINE 185: sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me
LINE 186: sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
LINE 187: safety of others is committed to my care.
LINE 188: I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
LINE 189: undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
LINE 190: the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
LINE 191: I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to "the
LINE 192: land of mist and snow," but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
LINE 193: be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and
LINE 194: woeful as the "Ancient Mariner." You will smile at my allusion, but I
LINE 195: will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my
LINE 196: passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
LINE 197: production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something
LINE 198: at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically
LINE 199: industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
LINE 200: labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
LINE 201: in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
LINE 202: of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
LINE 203: regions I am about to explore.
LINE 204: But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after
LINE 205: having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
LINE 206: Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to
LINE 207: look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to
LINE 208: me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when
LINE 209: I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
LINE 210: Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.
LINE 211: Your affectionate brother,
LINE 212: Robert Walton
LINE 213: Letter 3
LINE 214: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
LINE 215: July 7th, 17—.
LINE 216: My dear Sister,
LINE 217: I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced
LINE 218: on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on
LINE 219: its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
LINE 220: see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good
LINE 221: spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
LINE 222: floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
LINE 223: of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We
LINE 224: have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
LINE 225: summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,
LINE 226: which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire
LINE 227: to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
LINE 228: expected.
LINE 229: No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
LINE 230: letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
LINE 231: accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
LINE 232: I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
LINE 233: Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
LINE 234: yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,
LINE 235: persevering, and prudent.
LINE 236: But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
LINE 237: have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
LINE 238: themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not
LINE 239: still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the
LINE 240: determined heart and resolved will of man?
LINE 241: My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must
LINE 242: finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!
LINE 243: R.W.
LINE 244: Letter 4
LINE 245: _To Mrs. Saville, England._
LINE 246: August 5th, 17—.
LINE 247: So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
LINE 248: recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
LINE 249: these papers can come into your possession.
LINE 250: Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
LINE 251: in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
LINE 252: she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
LINE 253: were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,
LINE 254: hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
LINE 255: About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
LINE 256: in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
LINE 257: have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
LINE 258: grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
LINE 259: attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
LINE 260: situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
LINE 261: dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
LINE 262: being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
LINE 263: sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
LINE 264: of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
LINE 265: distant inequalities of the ice.
LINE 266: This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
LINE 267: many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
LINE 268: it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
LINE 269: ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
LINE 270: greatest attention.
LINE 271: About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
LINE 272: night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
LINE 273: morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
LINE 274: float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to
LINE 275: rest for a few hours.
LINE 276: In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
LINE 277: found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
LINE 278: talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
LINE 279: had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
LINE 280: fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
LINE 281: being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
LINE 282: He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
LINE 283: some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the
LINE 284: master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
LINE 285: on the open sea."
LINE 286: On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
LINE 287: foreign accent. "Before I come on board your vessel," said he,
LINE 288: "will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"
LINE 289: You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
LINE 290: to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
LINE 291: supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
LINE 292: have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
LINE 293: replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
LINE 294: northern pole.
LINE 295: Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
LINE 296: Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
LINE 297: his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were
LINE 298: nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
LINE 299: suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted
LINE 300: to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
LINE 301: air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
LINE 302: restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
LINE 303: swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we
LINE 304: wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
LINE 305: kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
LINE 306: which restored him wonderfully.
LINE 307: Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
LINE 308: feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he
LINE 309: had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and
LINE 310: attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more
LINE 311: interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
LINE 312: wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
LINE 313: performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
LINE 314: trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
LINE 315: a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he
LINE 316: is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
LINE 317: teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
LINE 318: When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
LINE 319: the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
LINE 320: allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
LINE 321: and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
LINE 322: Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
LINE 323: in so strange a vehicle.
LINE 324: His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
LINE 325: he replied, "To seek one who fled from me."
LINE 326: "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"
LINE 327: "Yes."
LINE 328: "Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
LINE 329: saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice."
LINE 330: This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of
LINE 331: questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
LINE 332: pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, "I have,
LINE 333: doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
LINE 334: people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."
LINE 335: "Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
LINE 336: trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine."
LINE 337: "And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
LINE 338: benevolently restored me to life."
LINE 339: Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
LINE 340: ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer
LINE 341: with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
LINE 342: midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
LINE 343: before that time; but of this I could not judge.
LINE 344: From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
LINE 345: stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
LINE 346: the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
LINE 347: the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
LINE 348: I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
LINE 349: notice if any new object should appear in sight.
LINE 350: Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
LINE 351: present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
LINE 352: silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
LINE 353: Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
LINE 354: interested in him, although they have had very little communication
LINE 355: with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
LINE 356: constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must
LINE 357: have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
LINE 358: so attractive and amiable.
LINE 359: I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend
LINE 360: on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been
LINE 361: broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
LINE 362: of my heart.
LINE 363: I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
LINE 364: should I have any fresh incidents to record.
LINE 365: August 13th, 17—.
LINE 366: My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my
LINE 367: admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so
LINE 368: noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
LINE 369: grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
LINE 370: when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
LINE 371: yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
LINE 372: He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
LINE 373: apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
LINE 374: unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
LINE 375: interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
LINE 376: conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without
LINE 377: disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
LINE 378: eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken
LINE 379: to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
LINE 380: language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
LINE 381: and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
LINE 382: sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
LINE 383: enterprise. One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for
LINE 384: the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should
LINE 385: acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a
LINE 386: dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At first I
LINE 387: perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
LINE 388: his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
LINE 389: fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I
LINE 390: paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: "Unhappy man! Do you
LINE 391: share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;
LINE 392: let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"
LINE 393: Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
LINE 394: paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
LINE 395: powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
LINE 396: necessary to restore his composure.
LINE 397: Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
LINE 398: himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
LINE 399: despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked
LINE 400: me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it
LINE 401: awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a
LINE 402: friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
LINE 403: had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
LINE 404: boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
LINE 405: "I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are
LINE 406: unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
LINE 407: ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to
LINE 408: perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most
LINE 409: noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
LINE 410: friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
LINE 411: despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life
LINE 412: anew."
LINE 413: As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
LINE 414: grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently
LINE 415: retired to his cabin.
LINE 416: Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
LINE 417: does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
LINE 418: afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
LINE 419: elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he
LINE 420: may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
LINE 421: has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
LINE 422: halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
LINE 423: Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine
LINE 424: wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and
LINE 425: refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
LINE 426: somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
LINE 427: appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I
LINE 428: have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
LINE 429: elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I
LINE 430: believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
LINE 431: power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
LINE 432: for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
LINE 433: voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.
LINE 434: August 19th, 17—.
LINE 435: Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain
LINE 436: Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
LINE 437: determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
LINE 438: me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for
LINE 439: knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
LINE 440: gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
LINE 441: has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
LINE 442: useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
LINE 443: course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
LINE 444: what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
LINE 445: that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
LINE 446: in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
LINE 447: deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
LINE 448: fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
LINE 449: will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
LINE 450: provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
LINE 451: of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
LINE 452: internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed."
LINE 453: You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
LINE 454: communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by
LINE 455: a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
LINE 456: the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
LINE 457: desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed
LINE 458: these feelings in my answer.
LINE 459: "I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is
LINE 460: useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I
LINE 461: shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling," continued he,
LINE 462: perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my
LINE 463: friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
LINE 464: destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
LINE 465: determined."
LINE 466: He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I
LINE 467: should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have
LINE 468: resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
LINE 469: record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
LINE 470: the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This
LINE 471: manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
LINE 472: know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and
LINE 473: sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my
LINE 474: task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
LINE 475: with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
LINE 476: animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
LINE 477: within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
LINE 478: embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!
LINE 479: Chapter 1
LINE 480: I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
LINE 481: distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
LINE 482: counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
LINE 483: situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
LINE 484: knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
LINE 485: business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
LINE 486: affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
LINE 487: marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
LINE 488: husband and the father of a family.
LINE 489: As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
LINE 490: refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a
LINE 491: merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
LINE 492: mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
LINE 493: proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
LINE 494: and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
LINE 495: distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
LINE 496: therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
LINE 497: daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
LINE 498: wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
LINE 499: was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
LINE 500: He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
LINE 501: so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in
LINE 502: endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
LINE 503: the world again through his credit and assistance.
LINE 504: Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
LINE 505: months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,
LINE 506: he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
LINE 507: Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort
LINE 508: had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
LINE 509: it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
LINE 510: the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
LINE 511: merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
LINE 512: his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
LINE 513: reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
LINE 514: of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
LINE 515: His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
LINE 516: with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
LINE 517: there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort
LINE 518: possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
LINE 519: her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
LINE 520: by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
LINE 521: support life.
LINE 522: Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time
LINE 523: was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
LINE 524: decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
LINE 525: her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
LINE 526: by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
LINE 527: chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
LINE 528: committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
LINE 529: conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a
LINE 530: relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
LINE 531: There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
LINE 532: this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
LINE 533: affection. There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind
LINE 534: which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
LINE 535: strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
LINE 536: late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
LINE 537: a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and
LINE 538: worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
LINE 539: doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
LINE 540: virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
LINE 541: her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
LINE 542: to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
LINE 543: and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
LINE 544: sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
LINE 545: with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
LINE 546: benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
LINE 547: constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During
LINE 548: the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
LINE 549: gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
LINE 550: their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
LINE 551: of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
LINE 552: as a restorative for her weakened frame.
LINE 553: From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born
LINE 554: at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained
LINE 555: for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each
LINE 556: other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
LINE 557: mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender caresses and
LINE 558: my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
LINE 559: first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something
LINE 560: better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
LINE 561: them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
LINE 562: their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
LINE 563: their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed
LINE 564: towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
LINE 565: of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
LINE 566: every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
LINE 567: and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
LINE 568: one train of enjoyment to me.
LINE 569: For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a
LINE 570: daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five
LINE 571: years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they
LINE 572: passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent
LINE 573: disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my
LINE 574: mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
LINE 575: passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
LINE 576: relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
LINE 577: afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
LINE 578: attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
LINE 579: of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
LINE 580: shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
LINE 581: accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,
LINE 582: hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
LINE 583: five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
LINE 584: above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
LINE 585: dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
LINE 586: hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
LINE 587: clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
LINE 588: clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
LINE 589: her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
LINE 590: her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
LINE 591: and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
LINE 592: The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
LINE 593: admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was
LINE 594: not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a
LINE 595: German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with
LINE 596: these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been
LINE 597: long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their
LINE 598: charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
LINE 599: of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
LINE 600: himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its
LINE 601: weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria
LINE 602: was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
LINE 603: a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
LINE 604: abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.
LINE 605: When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
LINE 606: our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed
LINE 607: to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
LINE 608: than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
LINE 609: permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
LINE 610: charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed
LINE 611: a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
LINE 612: and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They
LINE 613: consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza
LINE 614: became the inmate of my parents' house—my more than
LINE 615: sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
LINE 616: my pleasures.
LINE 617: Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential
LINE 618: attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
LINE 619: pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to
LINE 620: my home, my mother had said playfully, "I have a pretty present for my
LINE 621: Victor—tomorrow he shall have it." And when, on the morrow, she
LINE 622: presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
LINE 623: seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
LINE 624: as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on
LINE 625: her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other
LINE 626: familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
LINE 627: forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than
LINE 628: sister, since till death she was to be mine only.
