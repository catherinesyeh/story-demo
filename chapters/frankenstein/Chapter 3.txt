LINE 1: When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
LINE 2: should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had
LINE 3: hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
LINE 4: necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
LINE 5: acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My
LINE 6: departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
LINE 7: resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
LINE 8: occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
LINE 9: Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
LINE 10: in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to
LINE 11: persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first
LINE 12: yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
LINE 13: favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She
LINE 14: attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
LINE 15: of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
LINE 16: imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother
LINE 17: sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
LINE 18: looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
LINE 19: deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
LINE 20: her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. "My
LINE 21: children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were
LINE 22: placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the
LINE 23: consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
LINE 24: my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy
LINE 25: and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are
LINE 26: not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
LINE 27: death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world."
LINE 28: She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
LINE 29: I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
LINE 30: by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
LINE 31: soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so
LINE 32: long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
LINE 33: and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
LINE 34: for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
LINE 35: extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
LINE 36: can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of
LINE 37: the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
LINE 38: evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has
LINE 39: not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I
LINE 40: describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at
LINE 41: length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
LINE 42: the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
LINE 43: sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still
LINE 44: duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
LINE 45: rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
LINE 46: spoiler has not seized.
LINE 47: My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
LINE 48: was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of
LINE 49: some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
LINE 50: akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
LINE 51: life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was
LINE 52: unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
LINE 53: all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.
LINE 54: She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
LINE 55: She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
LINE 56: zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
LINE 57: her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
LINE 58: when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
LINE 59: She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
LINE 60: The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last
LINE 61: evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
LINE 62: him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His
LINE 63: father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
LINE 64: aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune
LINE 65: of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when
LINE 66: he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
LINE 67: restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
LINE 68: of commerce.
LINE 69: We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
LINE 70: persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!" It was said, and we
LINE 71: retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
LINE 72: other was deceived; but when at morning's dawn I descended to the
LINE 73: carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
LINE 74: again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to
LINE 75: renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last
LINE 76: feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
LINE 77: I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
LINE 78: the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
LINE 79: amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
LINE 80: pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I
LINE 81: must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto
LINE 82: been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
LINE 83: repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
LINE 84: Clerval; these were "old familiar faces," but I believed myself
LINE 85: totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as
LINE 86: I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
LINE 87: ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
LINE 88: thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
LINE 89: longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
LINE 90: Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
LINE 91: repent.
LINE 92: I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
LINE 93: journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the
LINE 94: high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was
LINE 95: conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.
LINE 96: The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
LINE 97: some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil
LINE 98: influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
LINE 99: from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's
LINE 100: door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He
LINE 101: was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
LINE 102: asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
LINE 103: of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and
LINE 104: partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
LINE 105: authors I had studied. The professor stared. "Have you," he
LINE 106: said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"
LINE 107: I replied in the affirmative. "Every minute," continued M. Krempe with
LINE 108: warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
LINE 109: and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems
LINE 110: and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,
LINE 111: where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
LINE 112: have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
LINE 113: are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
LINE 114: age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
LINE 115: sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."
LINE 116: So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
LINE 117: treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
LINE 118: dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
LINE 119: week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
LINE 120: philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
LINE 121: professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
LINE 122: omitted.
LINE 123: I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
LINE 124: considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
LINE 125: returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
LINE 126: shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
LINE 127: repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
LINE 128: favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a
LINE 129: strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
LINE 130: to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been
LINE 131: content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
LINE 132: science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
LINE 133: extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
LINE 134: steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
LINE 135: discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
LINE 136: Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
LINE 137: It was very different when the masters of the science sought
LINE 138: immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
LINE 139: the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
LINE 140: itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
LINE 141: science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of
LINE 142: boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
LINE 143: Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
LINE 144: residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
LINE 145: acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
LINE 146: abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information
LINE 147: which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I
LINE 148: could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
LINE 149: sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
LINE 150: Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
LINE 151: Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
LINE 152: room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very
LINE 153: unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
LINE 154: aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
LINE 155: temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
LINE 156: was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
LINE 157: He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
LINE 158: the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
LINE 159: with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
LINE 160: a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
LINE 161: its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he
LINE 162: concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
LINE 163: shall never forget:
LINE 164: "The ancient teachers of this science," said he,
LINE 165: "promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters
LINE 166: promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
LINE 167: the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
LINE 168: only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
LINE 169: crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses
LINE 170: of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the
LINE 171: heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
LINE 172: the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
LINE 173: they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
LINE 174: mock the invisible world with its own shadows."
LINE 175: Such were the professor's words—rather let me say such the words of
LINE 176: the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul
LINE 177: were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
LINE 178: touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
LINE 179: sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
LINE 180: one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
LINE 181: Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
LINE 182: already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
LINE 183: unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
LINE 184: I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of
LINE 185: insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
LINE 186: had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning's dawn,
LINE 187: sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.
LINE 188: There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
LINE 189: devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
LINE 190: natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
LINE 191: manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
LINE 192: for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
LINE 193: his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
LINE 194: gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
LINE 195: given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little
LINE 196: narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
LINE 197: Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
LINE 198: exhibited. He said that "These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
LINE 199: modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
LINE 200: knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
LINE 201: and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
LINE 202: great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
LINE 203: labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
LINE 204: fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind." I
LINE 205: listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
LINE 206: or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
LINE 207: prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
LINE 208: terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
LINE 209: instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
LINE 210: made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
LINE 211: labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
LINE 212: procure.
LINE 213: "I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a
LINE 214: disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
LINE 215: your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
LINE 216: greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
LINE 217: I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
LINE 218: neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry
LINE 219: chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your
LINE 220: wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
LINE 221: experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
LINE 222: philosophy, including mathematics."
LINE 223: He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
LINE 224: various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and
LINE 225: promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in
LINE 226: the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of
LINE 227: books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
LINE 228: Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
