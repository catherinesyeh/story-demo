LINE 1: "Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.
LINE 2: I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
LINE 3: their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.
LINE 4: "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
LINE 5: generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
LINE 6: become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
LINE 7: were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the
LINE 8: progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
LINE 9: in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.
LINE 10: "One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
LINE 11: collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
LINE 12: the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
LINE 13: some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
LINE 14: Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I
LINE 15: had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume
LINE 16: of _Plutarch's Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The
LINE 17: possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually
LINE 18: studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
LINE 19: employed in their ordinary occupations.
LINE 20: "I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced
LINE 21: in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
LINE 22: to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In
LINE 23: the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
LINE 24: story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
LINE 25: what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
LINE 26: never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
LINE 27: domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
LINE 28: feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
LINE 29: well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
LINE 30: were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a
LINE 31: more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
LINE 32: contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon
LINE 33: death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not
LINE 34: pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
LINE 35: the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
LINE 36: understanding it.
LINE 37: "As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
LINE 38: condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
LINE 39: unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
LINE 40: was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I
LINE 41: was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
LINE 42: 'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my
LINE 43: annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did
LINE 44: this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my
LINE 45: destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to
LINE 46: solve them.
LINE 47: "The volume of _Plutarch's Lives_ which I possessed contained the
LINE 48: histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book
LINE 49: had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I
LINE 50: learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
LINE 51: taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
LINE 52: own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many
LINE 53: things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very
LINE 54: confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
LINE 55: and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
LINE 56: large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
LINE 57: only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
LINE 58: developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned
LINE 59: in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the
LINE 60: greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
LINE 61: far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
LINE 62: were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
LINE 63: feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
LINE 64: Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The
LINE 65: patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
LINE 66: firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
LINE 67: been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
LINE 68: have been imbued with different sensations.
LINE 69: "But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read
LINE 70: it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
LINE 71: a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
LINE 72: picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
LINE 73: exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
LINE 74: struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
LINE 75: any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
LINE 76: in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a
LINE 77: perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
LINE 78: his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
LINE 79: beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
LINE 80: Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
LINE 81: often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
LINE 82: gall of envy rose within me.
LINE 83: "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon
LINE 84: after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
LINE 85: the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had
LINE 86: neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
LINE 87: which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was
LINE 88: your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You
LINE 89: minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
LINE 90: of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
LINE 91: occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.
LINE 92: Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
LINE 93: origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
LINE 94: which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
LINE 95: and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
LINE 96: horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. 'Hateful
LINE 97: day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony. 'Accursed creator!
LINE 98: Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
LINE 99: disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
LINE 100: image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
LINE 101: very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
LINE 102: and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.'
LINE 103: "These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
LINE 104: but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
LINE 105: benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
LINE 106: become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
LINE 107: compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
LINE 108: from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
LINE 109: and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
LINE 110: to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I
LINE 111: postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
LINE 112: attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
LINE 113: Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
LINE 114: day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
LINE 115: until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.
LINE 116: "Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The
LINE 117: presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
LINE 118: found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha
LINE 119: spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
LINE 120: their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
LINE 121: contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
LINE 122: mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only
LINE 123: discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I
LINE 124: cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person
LINE 125: reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
LINE 126: image and that inconstant shade.
LINE 127: "I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
LINE 128: which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
LINE 129: thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
LINE 130: dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
LINE 131: feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
LINE 132: smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
LINE 133: sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam's
LINE 134: supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,
LINE 135: and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.
LINE 136: "Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
LINE 137: and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
LINE 138: had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did
LINE 139: not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
LINE 140: conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief
LINE 141: delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
LINE 142: apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
LINE 143: towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the
LINE 144: absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and
LINE 145: their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
LINE 146: casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the
LINE 147: greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
LINE 148: heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
LINE 149: their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
LINE 150: limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from
LINE 151: me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
LINE 152: never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
LINE 153: little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
LINE 154: believe myself utterly unworthy of it.
LINE 155: "The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
LINE 156: place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely
LINE 157: directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
LINE 158: protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
LINE 159: fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
LINE 160: I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
LINE 161: person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
LINE 162: beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
LINE 163: thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
LINE 164: the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
LINE 165: be tolerated by my younger protectors.
LINE 166: "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
LINE 167: and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
LINE 168: and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
LINE 169: desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,
LINE 170: he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
LINE 171: sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his
LINE 172: countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
LINE 173: thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
LINE 174: instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
LINE 175: "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
LINE 176: would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a
LINE 177: neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
LINE 178: excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
LINE 179: limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting
LINE 180: all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
LINE 181: placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived
LINE 182: me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
LINE 183: cottage.
LINE 184: "I knocked. 'Who is there?' said the old man. 'Come in.'
LINE 185: "I entered. 'Pardon this intrusion,' said I; 'I am
LINE 186: a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
LINE 187: would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.'
LINE 188: "'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what
LINE 189: manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
LINE 190: from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to
LINE 191: procure food for you.'
LINE 192: "'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is
LINE 193: warmth and rest only that I need.'
LINE 194: "I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was
LINE 195: precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence
LINE 196: the interview, when the old man addressed me.
LINE 197: 'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you
LINE 198: French?'
LINE 199: "'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that
LINE 200: language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
LINE 201: whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.'
LINE 202: "'Are they Germans?'
LINE 203: "'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an
LINE 204: unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation
LINE 205: or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never
LINE 206: seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail
LINE 207: there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.'
LINE 208: "'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
LINE 209: the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
LINE 210: full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;
LINE 211: and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.'
LINE 212: "'They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
LINE 213: but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
LINE 214: dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
LINE 215: beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
LINE 216: ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
LINE 217: monster.'
LINE 218: "'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
LINE 219: you undeceive them?'
LINE 220: "'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
LINE 221: feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I
LINE 222: have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
LINE 223: kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and
LINE 224: it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.'
LINE 225: "'Where do these friends reside?'
LINE 226: "'Near this spot.'
LINE 227: "The old man paused and then continued, 'If you will unreservedly
LINE 228: confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
LINE 229: undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
LINE 230: there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
LINE 231: sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
LINE 232: to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.'
LINE 233: "'Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You
LINE 234: raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,
LINE 235: I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
LINE 236: creatures.'
LINE 237: "'Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only
LINE 238: drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am
LINE 239: unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
LINE 240: judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.'
LINE 241: "'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips
LINE 242: first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall
LINE 243: be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
LINE 244: with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.'
LINE 245: "'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'
LINE 246: "I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
LINE 247: rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for
LINE 248: firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
LINE 249: remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that
LINE 250: moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment
LINE 251: to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the
LINE 252: time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I
LINE 253: seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!'
LINE 254: "'Great God!' exclaimed the old man. 'Who are you?'
LINE 255: "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
LINE 256: Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
LINE 257: beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
LINE 258: friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with
LINE 259: supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
LINE 260: a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
LINE 261: with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
LINE 262: the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
LINE 263: I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
LINE 264: overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
LINE 265: tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel."
