LINE 1: I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
LINE 2: benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,
LINE 3: with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
LINE 4: he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
LINE 5: About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
LINE 6: magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
LINE 7: his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock,
LINE 8: they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
LINE 9: for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
LINE 10: not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
LINE 11: two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
LINE 12: and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
LINE 13: along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
LINE 14: length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the
LINE 15: light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
LINE 16: who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
LINE 17: corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
LINE 18: waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
LINE 19: that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
LINE 20: of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
LINE 21: to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
LINE 22: years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
LINE 23: any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
LINE 24: The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
LINE 25: when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of
LINE 26: my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
LINE 27: mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
LINE 28: support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
LINE 29: an unfavourable augury from my manner.
LINE 30: The son confirmed his father's account, but when Daniel Nugent was
LINE 31: called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
LINE 32: saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
LINE 33: and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
LINE 34: boat in which I had just landed.
LINE 35: A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
LINE 36: of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
LINE 37: before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
LINE 38: only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
LINE 39: was afterwards found.
LINE 40: Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
LINE 41: body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and
LINE 42: rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
LINE 43: quite gone.
LINE 44: Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
LINE 45: that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
LINE 46: was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been
LINE 47: obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
LINE 48: Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body
LINE 49: from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know
LINE 50: the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
LINE 51: of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.
LINE 52: Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into
LINE 53: the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
LINE 54: effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
LINE 55: suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
LINE 56: murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
LINE 57: and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the
LINE 58: strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
LINE 59: knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had
LINE 60: inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
LINE 61: tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.
LINE 62: I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How
LINE 63: can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
LINE 64: horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
LINE 65: agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
LINE 66: passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry
LINE 67: Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
LINE 68: the body, I exclaimed, "Have my murderous machinations deprived you
LINE 69: also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other
LINE 70: victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my
LINE 71: benefactor—"
LINE 72: The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and
LINE 73: I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
LINE 74: A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my
LINE 75: ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the
LINE 76: murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
LINE 77: attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was
LINE 78: tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
LINE 79: my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke
LINE 80: my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
LINE 81: bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
LINE 82: Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not
LINE 83: sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
LINE 84: children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
LINE 85: youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
LINE 86: next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I
LINE 87: made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
LINE 88: the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
LINE 89: But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
LINE 90: a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
LINE 91: gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
LINE 92: It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had
LINE 93: forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
LINE 94: great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around
LINE 95: and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I
LINE 96: was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.
LINE 97: This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
LINE 98: me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
LINE 99: countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
LINE 100: that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
LINE 101: persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her
LINE 102: tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
LINE 103: and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
LINE 104: "Are you better now, sir?" said she.
LINE 105: I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, "I believe I am;
LINE 106: but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am
LINE 107: still alive to feel this misery and horror."
LINE 108: "For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the
LINE 109: gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
LINE 110: were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that's none
LINE 111: of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
LINE 112: with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same."
LINE 113: I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
LINE 114: speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
LINE 115: languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series
LINE 116: of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
LINE 117: were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
LINE 118: of reality.
LINE 119: As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
LINE 120: feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
LINE 121: me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The
LINE 122: physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
LINE 123: them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
LINE 124: expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
LINE 125: second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
LINE 126: hangman who would gain his fee?
LINE 127: These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
LINE 128: shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison
LINE 129: to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
LINE 130: had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to
LINE 131: see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
LINE 132: every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
LINE 133: miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see
LINE 134: that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
LINE 135: intervals.
LINE 136: One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
LINE 137: half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom
LINE 138: and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
LINE 139: remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I
LINE 140: considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
LINE 141: penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my
LINE 142: thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.
LINE 143: His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
LINE 144: mine and addressed me in French,
LINE 145: "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to
LINE 146: make you more comfortable?"
LINE 147: "I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
LINE 148: earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving."
LINE 149: "I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
LINE 150: one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I
LINE 151: hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
LINE 152: easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge."
LINE 153: "That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become
LINE 154: the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and
LINE 155: have been, can death be any evil to me?"
LINE 156: "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
LINE 157: strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some
LINE 158: surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
LINE 159: seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
LINE 160: presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
LINE 161: unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
LINE 162: your path."
LINE 163: As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
LINE 164: this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at
LINE 165: the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some
LINE 166: astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened
LINE 167: to say,
LINE 168: "Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
LINE 169: your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some
LINE 170: trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
LINE 171: and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I
LINE 172: discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote
LINE 173: to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
LINE 174: But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
LINE 175: kind."
LINE 176: "This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
LINE 177: tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
LINE 178: now to lament?"
LINE 179: "Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin with
LINE 180: gentleness; "and someone, a friend, is come to visit you."
LINE 181: I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
LINE 182: instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
LINE 183: misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
LINE 184: me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
LINE 185: and cried out in agony,
LINE 186: "Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not
LINE 187: let him enter!"
LINE 188: Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help
LINE 189: regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
LINE 190: rather a severe tone,
LINE 191: "I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
LINE 192: would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance."
LINE 193: "My father!" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
LINE 194: from anguish to pleasure. "Is my father indeed come? How kind, how
LINE 195: very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?"
LINE 196: My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
LINE 197: thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
LINE 198: and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and
LINE 199: quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
LINE 200: Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
LINE 201: arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,
LINE 202: "Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?"
LINE 203: My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
LINE 204: dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
LINE 205: desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
LINE 206: cheerfulness. "What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!"
LINE 207: said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
LINE 208: of the room. "You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
LINE 209: to pursue you. And poor Clerval—"
LINE 210: The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
LINE 211: great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
LINE 212: "Alas! Yes, my father," replied I; "some destiny of the
LINE 213: most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
LINE 214: should have died on the coffin of Henry."
LINE 215: We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
LINE 216: precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
LINE 217: could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my
LINE 218: strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the
LINE 219: appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
LINE 220: gradually recovered my health.
LINE 221: As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
LINE 222: melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was
LINE 223: for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation
LINE 224: into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
LINE 225: relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
LINE 226: life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
LINE 227: drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
LINE 228: throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
LINE 229: me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
LINE 230: sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
LINE 231: wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
LINE 232: motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
LINE 233: might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
LINE 234: The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months
LINE 235: in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
LINE 236: relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
LINE 237: town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
LINE 238: care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared
LINE 239: the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
LINE 240: brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand
LINE 241: jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
LINE 242: Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
LINE 243: after my removal I was liberated from prison.
LINE 244: My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
LINE 245: criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh
LINE 246: atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not
LINE 247: participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
LINE 248: palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
LINE 249: although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
LINE 250: saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
LINE 251: no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes
LINE 252: they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
LINE 253: orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
LINE 254: them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I
LINE 255: first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
LINE 256: My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked
LINE 257: of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
LINE 258: these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a
LINE 259: wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
LINE 260: cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
LINE 261: the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
LINE 262: childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
LINE 263: prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
LINE 264: these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
LINE 265: despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
LINE 266: existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
LINE 267: to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.
LINE 268: Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
LINE 269: triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should
LINE 270: return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
LINE 271: I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
LINE 272: chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
LINE 273: blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
LINE 274: the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the
LINE 275: mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to
LINE 276: delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
LINE 277: journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My
LINE 278: strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
LINE 279: preyed upon my wasted frame.
LINE 280: Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
LINE 281: my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel
LINE 282: bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.
LINE 283: It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
LINE 284: the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my
LINE 285: sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should
LINE 286: soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
LINE 287: yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
LINE 288: shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
LINE 289: that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
LINE 290: companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I
LINE 291: repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
LINE 292: with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
LINE 293: Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
LINE 294: to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
LINE 295: which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
LINE 296: thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
LINE 297: Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking
LINE 298: every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
LINE 299: only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
LINE 300: life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now
LINE 301: swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did
LINE 302: not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
LINE 303: thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind
LINE 304: of nightmare; I felt the fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free
LINE 305: myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was
LINE 306: watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
LINE 307: were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
LINE 308: security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
LINE 309: and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
LINE 310: forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
LINE 311: susceptible.
