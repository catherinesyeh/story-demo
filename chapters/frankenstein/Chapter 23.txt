LINE 1: It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
LINE 2: shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
LINE 3: contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
LINE 4: in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.
LINE 5: The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
LINE 6: in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
LINE 7: beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
LINE 8: flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
LINE 9: scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
LINE 10: that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
LINE 11: I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
LINE 12: shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious
LINE 13: and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
LINE 14: my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
LINE 15: life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
LINE 16: of my adversary was extinguished.
LINE 17: Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
LINE 18: but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
LINE 19: trembling, she asked, "What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
LINE 20: What is it you fear?"
LINE 21: "Oh! Peace, peace, my love," replied I; "this night, and
LINE 22: all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful."
LINE 23: I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
LINE 24: fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
LINE 25: and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
LINE 26: until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.
LINE 27: She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
LINE 28: of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
LINE 29: my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
LINE 30: conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
LINE 31: execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
LINE 32: scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I
LINE 33: heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
LINE 34: motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
LINE 35: trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
LINE 36: state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
LINE 37: into the room.
LINE 38: Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
LINE 39: destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was
LINE 40: there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
LINE 41: and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I
LINE 42: turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
LINE 43: by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!
LINE 44: Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
LINE 45: only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
LINE 46: When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
LINE 47: countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
LINE 48: appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I
LINE 49: escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my
LINE 50: wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
LINE 51: posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
LINE 52: her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
LINE 53: supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
LINE 54: the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held
LINE 55: in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.
LINE 56: The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the
LINE 57: breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
LINE 58: While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
LINE 59: The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
LINE 60: panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
LINE 61: The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
LINE 62: described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
LINE 63: A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
LINE 64: fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards
LINE 65: the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
LINE 66: leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
LINE 67: plunged into the lake.
LINE 68: The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to
LINE 69: the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
LINE 70: boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we
LINE 71: returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
LINE 72: form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to
LINE 73: search the country, parties going in different directions among the
LINE 74: woods and vines.
LINE 75: I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
LINE 76: house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
LINE 77: man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
LINE 78: eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I
LINE 79: was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
LINE 80: happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
LINE 81: I had lost.
LINE 82: After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
LINE 83: where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I
LINE 84: hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
LINE 85: distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
LINE 86: various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
LINE 87: cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death
LINE 88: of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
LINE 89: of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
LINE 90: friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
LINE 91: might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
LINE 92: feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started
LINE 93: up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
LINE 94: There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
LINE 95: wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was
LINE 96: hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men
LINE 97: to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
LINE 98: mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
LINE 99: and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
LINE 100: exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
LINE 101: to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
LINE 102: familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day
LINE 103: before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
LINE 104: Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
LINE 105: the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
LINE 106: then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
LINE 107: a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
LINE 108: but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had
LINE 109: snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
LINE 110: so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
LINE 111: man.
LINE 112: But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
LINE 113: overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their
LINE 114: _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
LINE 115: that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My
LINE 116: own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of
LINE 117: my hideous narration.
LINE 118: I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
LINE 119: under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
LINE 120: man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
LINE 121: delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
LINE 122: all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
LINE 123: few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed
LINE 124: be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
LINE 125: in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
LINE 126: around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
LINE 127: rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.
LINE 128: What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
LINE 129: darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,
LINE 130: indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
LINE 131: with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
LINE 132: dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear
LINE 133: conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
LINE 134: prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I
LINE 135: understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.
LINE 136: Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
LINE 137: awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the
LINE 138: memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their
LINE 139: cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had
LINE 140: sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a
LINE 141: maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
LINE 142: that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
LINE 143: revenge on his cursed head.
LINE 144: Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
LINE 145: reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
LINE 146: a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town
LINE 147: and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the
LINE 148: destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole
LINE 149: authority for the apprehension of the murderer.
LINE 150: The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. "Be
LINE 151: assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my part shall
LINE 152: be spared to discover the villain."
LINE 153: "I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the
LINE 154: deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I
LINE 155: should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
LINE 156: which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to
LINE 157: be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My
LINE 158: manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my
LINE 159: own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
LINE 160: quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related
LINE 161: my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
LINE 162: accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.
LINE 163: The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued
LINE 164: he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with
LINE 165: horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
LINE 166: on his countenance.
LINE 167: When I had concluded my narration, I said, "This is the being whom I
LINE 168: accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
LINE 169: whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
LINE 170: your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
LINE 171: functions on this occasion."
LINE 172: This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
LINE 173: auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
LINE 174: to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
LINE 175: to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
LINE 176: returned. He, however, answered mildly, "I would willingly afford you
LINE 177: every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
LINE 178: have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an
LINE 179: animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
LINE 180: no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
LINE 181: the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
LINE 182: has wandered or what region he may now inhabit."
LINE 183: "I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if
LINE 184: he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
LINE 185: and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not
LINE 186: credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
LINE 187: punishment which is his desert."
LINE 188: As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
LINE 189: "You are mistaken," said he. "I will exert myself, and if
LINE 190: it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
LINE 191: punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have
LINE 192: yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
LINE 193: impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
LINE 194: make up your mind to disappointment."
LINE 195: "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My
LINE 196: revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
LINE 197: confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage
LINE 198: is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
LINE 199: loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have
LINE 200: but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
LINE 201: his destruction."
LINE 202: I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
LINE 203: in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
LINE 204: which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
LINE 205: magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
LINE 206: devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
LINE 207: madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
LINE 208: reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
LINE 209: "Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
LINE 210: wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say."
LINE 211: I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
LINE 212: some other mode of action.
