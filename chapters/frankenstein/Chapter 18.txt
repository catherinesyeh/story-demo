LINE 1: Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
LINE 2: I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
LINE 3: vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
LINE 4: repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
LINE 5: compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
LINE 6: study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries
LINE 7: having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
LINE 8: material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
LINE 9: father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
LINE 10: every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
LINE 11: undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
LINE 12: me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
LINE 13: hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
LINE 14: unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
LINE 15: father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
LINE 16: towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
LINE 17: which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
LINE 18: blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
LINE 19: refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake
LINE 20: alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
LINE 21: rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and
LINE 22: bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
LINE 23: on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
LINE 24: and a more cheerful heart.
LINE 25: It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
LINE 26: calling me aside, thus addressed me,
LINE 27: "I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
LINE 28: pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still
LINE 29: unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in
LINE 30: conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
LINE 31: and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a
LINE 32: point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."
LINE 33: I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—
LINE 34: "I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
LINE 35: marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
LINE 36: stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your
LINE 37: earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
LINE 38: tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of
LINE 39: man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
LINE 40: entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
LINE 41: wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another
LINE 42: whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
LINE 43: Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
LINE 44: to feel."
LINE 45: "My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and
LINE 46: sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my
LINE 47: warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are
LINE 48: entirely bound up in the expectation of our union."
LINE 49: "The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
LINE 50: gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you
LINE 51: feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
LINE 52: a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
LINE 53: strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
LINE 54: therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
LINE 55: marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
LINE 56: from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
LINE 57: are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
LINE 58: fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
LINE 59: plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,
LINE 60: however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
LINE 61: your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
LINE 62: with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
LINE 63: sincerity."
LINE 64: I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
LINE 65: of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
LINE 66: thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me
LINE 67: the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
LINE 68: dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
LINE 69: and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
LINE 70: impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
LINE 71: with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
LINE 72: ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
LINE 73: his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
LINE 74: which I expected peace.
LINE 75: I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
LINE 76: England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
LINE 77: of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
LINE 78: use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining
LINE 79: the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
LINE 80: had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
LINE 81: loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar
LINE 82: intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful
LINE 83: accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
LINE 84: thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I
LINE 85: should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
LINE 86: harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
LINE 87: unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
LINE 88: employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
LINE 89: restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,
LINE 90: the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
LINE 91: accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
LINE 92: slavery for ever.
LINE 93: These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to
LINE 94: visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I
LINE 95: clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I
LINE 96: urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
LINE 97: comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
LINE 98: resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
LINE 99: that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
LINE 100: and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
LINE 101: return, have restored me entirely to myself.
LINE 102: The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
LINE 103: at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind
LINE 104: precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without
LINE 105: previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
LINE 106: arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered
LINE 107: with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
LINE 108: commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
LINE 109: an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many
LINE 110: hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
LINE 111: me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
LINE 112: force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
LINE 113: contemplate its progress?
LINE 114: To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
LINE 115: with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father's
LINE 116: age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one
LINE 117: reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my
LINE 118: unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
LINE 119: enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and
LINE 120: forget the past in my union with her.
LINE 121: I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
LINE 122: which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should
LINE 123: leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
LINE 124: unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
LINE 125: departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
LINE 126: would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in
LINE 127: itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
LINE 128: I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
LINE 129: this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the
LINE 130: slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
LINE 131: the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
LINE 132: would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
LINE 133: machinations.
LINE 134: It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
LINE 135: country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
LINE 136: therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
LINE 137: my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had
LINE 138: been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
LINE 139: is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's
LINE 140: sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
LINE 141: conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
LINE 142: farewell.
LINE 143: I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
LINE 144: knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
LINE 145: I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
LINE 146: it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
LINE 147: me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
LINE 148: and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could
LINE 149: only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
LINE 150: me whilst they endured.
LINE 151: After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
LINE 152: many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
LINE 153: Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He
LINE 154: was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
LINE 155: setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
LINE 156: day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
LINE 157: the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to live," he cried;
LINE 158: "now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
LINE 159: you desponding and sorrowful!" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
LINE 160: thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
LINE 161: sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more
LINE 162: amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
LINE 163: eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a
LINE 164: miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
LINE 165: enjoyment.
LINE 166: We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to
LINE 167: Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this
LINE 168: voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
LINE 169: We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
LINE 170: Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz
LINE 171: becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds
LINE 172: between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
LINE 173: many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
LINE 174: black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,
LINE 175: presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view
LINE 176: rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
LINE 177: the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
LINE 178: flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
LINE 179: and populous towns occupy the scene.
LINE 180: We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
LINE 181: as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
LINE 182: continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
LINE 183: bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
LINE 184: drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
LINE 185: were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
LINE 186: been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
LINE 187: man. "I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes
LINE 188: of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
LINE 189: snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
LINE 190: and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
LINE 191: were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
LINE 192: appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
LINE 193: up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
LINE 194: on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
LINE 195: where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
LINE 196: where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
LINE 197: nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
LINE 198: but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
LINE 199: mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
LINE 200: charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
LINE 201: Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
LINE 202: island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
LINE 203: that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
LINE 204: half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
LINE 205: and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
LINE 206: pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
LINE 207: our own country."
LINE 208: Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
LINE 209: to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a
LINE 210: being formed in the "very poetry of nature." His wild and
LINE 211: enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
LINE 212: soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
LINE 213: devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
LINE 214: in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
LINE 215: satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard
LINE 216: only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—
LINE 217: ——The sounding cataract
LINE 218: Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
LINE 219: The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
LINE 220: Their colours and their forms, were then to him
LINE 221: An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
LINE 222: That had no need of a remoter charm,
LINE 223: By thought supplied, or any interest
LINE 224: Unborrow'd from the eye.
LINE 225: [Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey".]
LINE 226: And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost
LINE 227: for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
LINE 228: and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
LINE 229: life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist
LINE 230: in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
LINE 231: beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
LINE 232: consoles your unhappy friend.
LINE 233: Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
LINE 234: tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
LINE 235: overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will
LINE 236: proceed with my tale.
LINE 237: Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to
LINE 238: post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
LINE 239: the river was too gentle to aid us.
LINE 240: Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
LINE 241: arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
LINE 242: It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw
LINE 243: the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;
LINE 244: they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
LINE 245: remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish
LINE 246: Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard
LINE 247: of even in my country.
LINE 248: At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering
LINE 249: above all, and the Tower famed in English history.
