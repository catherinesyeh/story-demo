LINE 1: The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon
LINE 2: found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
LINE 3: could continue my journey. My father's care and attentions were
LINE 4: indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
LINE 5: sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
LINE 6: seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
LINE 7: abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
LINE 8: attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
LINE 9: angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right
LINE 10: to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose
LINE 11: joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they
LINE 12: would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
LINE 13: my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!
LINE 14: My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
LINE 15: various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I
LINE 16: felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
LINE 17: murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
LINE 18: "Alas! My father," said I, "how little do you know me.
LINE 19: Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
LINE 20: a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent
LINE 21: as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
LINE 22: of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all
LINE 23: died by my hands."
LINE 24: My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
LINE 25: assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
LINE 26: explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
LINE 27: delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
LINE 28: itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my
LINE 29: convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
LINE 30: concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be
LINE 31: supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,
LINE 32: besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
LINE 33: hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
LINE 34: his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
LINE 35: silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
LINE 36: Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
LINE 37: from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
LINE 38: relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.
LINE 39: Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
LINE 40: "My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat
LINE 41: you never to make such an assertion again."
LINE 42: "I am not mad," I cried energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who
LINE 43: have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the
LINE 44: assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
LINE 45: A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
LINE 46: saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
LINE 47: sacrifice the whole human race."
LINE 48: The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
LINE 49: deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
LINE 50: endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as
LINE 51: possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
LINE 52: Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
LINE 53: misfortunes.
LINE 54: As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
LINE 55: heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
LINE 56: crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost
LINE 57: self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
LINE 58: sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
LINE 59: were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
LINE 60: to the sea of ice.
LINE 61: A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the
LINE 62: following letter from Elizabeth:
LINE 63: "My dear Friend,
LINE 64: "It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
LINE 65: dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may
LINE 66: hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you
LINE 67: must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than
LINE 68: when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
LINE 69: tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in
LINE 70: your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
LINE 71: comfort and tranquillity.
LINE 72: "Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
LINE 73: a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at
LINE 74: this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
LINE 75: conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
LINE 76: some explanation necessary before we meet.
LINE 77: Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If
LINE 78: you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
LINE 79: But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
LINE 80: be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
LINE 81: case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
LINE 82: have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.
LINE 83: "You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
LINE 84: your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and
LINE 85: taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
LINE 86: place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
LINE 87: believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
LINE 88: as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
LINE 89: other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
LINE 90: case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
LINE 91: happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?
LINE 92: "You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
LINE 93: Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
LINE 94: autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
LINE 95: creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
LINE 96: connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
LINE 97: your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
LINE 98: But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love
LINE 99: you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
LINE 100: friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
LINE 101: own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
LINE 102: miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now
LINE 103: I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
LINE 104: misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
LINE 105: love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who
LINE 106: have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
LINE 107: tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured
LINE 108: that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
LINE 109: made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you
LINE 110: obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
LINE 111: will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.
LINE 112: "Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
LINE 113: next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle
LINE 114: will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your
LINE 115: lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
LINE 116: shall need no other happiness.
LINE 117: "Elizabeth Lavenza.
LINE 118: "Geneva, May 18th, 17—"
LINE 119: This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
LINE 120: the fiend—"_I will be with you on your
LINE 121: wedding-night!_" Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
LINE 122: dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
LINE 123: happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he
LINE 124: had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
LINE 125: deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
LINE 126: victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
LINE 127: were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
LINE 128: peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
LINE 129: cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
LINE 130: penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my
LINE 131: Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
LINE 132: remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.
LINE 133: Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some
LINE 134: softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
LINE 135: dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
LINE 136: angel's arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make
LINE 137: her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
LINE 138: again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My
LINE 139: destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
LINE 140: should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
LINE 141: surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
LINE 142: _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
LINE 143: threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
LINE 144: he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
LINE 145: after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
LINE 146: immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
LINE 147: father's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life
LINE 148: should not retard it a single hour.
LINE 149: In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and
LINE 150: affectionate. "I fear, my beloved girl," I said, "little happiness
LINE 151: remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
LINE 152: you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
LINE 153: and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
LINE 154: dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
LINE 155: horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
LINE 156: wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of
LINE 157: misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
LINE 158: for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But
LINE 159: until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most
LINE 160: earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply."
LINE 161: In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned
LINE 162: to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
LINE 163: in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a
LINE 164: change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
LINE 165: vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
LINE 166: compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I
LINE 167: was.
LINE 168: The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness
LINE 169: with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
LINE 170: me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
LINE 171: despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
LINE 172: bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
LINE 173: Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
LINE 174: would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
LINE 175: feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason
LINE 176: returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
LINE 177: resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
LINE 178: guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
LINE 179: otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
LINE 180: Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
LINE 181: Elizabeth. I remained silent.
LINE 182: "Have you, then, some other attachment?"
LINE 183: "None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with
LINE 184: delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
LINE 185: myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."
LINE 186: "My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen
LINE 187: us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
LINE 188: for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be
LINE 189: small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
LINE 190: And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
LINE 191: care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
LINE 192: deprived."
LINE 193: Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the
LINE 194: threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
LINE 195: yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
LINE 196: invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words "_I shall be with
LINE 197: you on your wedding-night_," I should regard the threatened fate as
LINE 198: unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were
LINE 199: balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
LINE 200: countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
LINE 201: ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,
LINE 202: the seal to my fate.
LINE 203: Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
LINE 204: intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
LINE 205: for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
LINE 206: the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if
LINE 207: possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
LINE 208: intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I
LINE 209: hastened that of a far dearer victim.
LINE 210: As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
LINE 211: a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my
LINE 212: feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
LINE 213: countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
LINE 214: eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
LINE 215: not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
LINE 216: that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
LINE 217: into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.
LINE 218: Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
LINE 219: and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own
LINE 220: heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
LINE 221: into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
LINE 222: decorations of my tragedy. Through my father's exertions a part of
LINE 223: the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
LINE 224: government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It
LINE 225: was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa
LINE 226: Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
LINE 227: near which it stood.
LINE 228: In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
LINE 229: fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
LINE 230: constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
LINE 231: by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the
LINE 232: period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
LINE 233: regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
LINE 234: in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
LINE 235: for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
LINE 236: as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.
LINE 237: Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
LINE 238: calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
LINE 239: destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
LINE 240: and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
LINE 241: promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the
LINE 242: meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
LINE 243: the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
LINE 244: After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
LINE 245: father's, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our
LINE 246: journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our
LINE 247: voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;
LINE 248: all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.
LINE 249: Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the
LINE 250: feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
LINE 251: were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
LINE 252: beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
LINE 253: Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,
LINE 254: surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
LINE 255: mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
LINE 256: opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
LINE 257: ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
LINE 258: insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.
LINE 259: I took the hand of Elizabeth. "You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If
LINE 260: you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would
LINE 261: endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
LINE 262: one day at least permits me to enjoy."
LINE 263: "Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope,
LINE 264: nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
LINE 265: painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
LINE 266: not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I
LINE 267: will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
LINE 268: along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
LINE 269: above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
LINE 270: interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
LINE 271: the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
LINE 272: the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature
LINE 273: appears!"
LINE 274: Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
LINE 275: reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;
LINE 276: joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
LINE 277: to distraction and reverie.
LINE 278: The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and
LINE 279: observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
LINE 280: lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
LINE 281: the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The
LINE 282: spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
LINE 283: of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
LINE 284: The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
LINE 285: sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
LINE 286: and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
LINE 287: shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
LINE 288: hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
LINE 289: the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
LINE 290: me and cling to me for ever.
