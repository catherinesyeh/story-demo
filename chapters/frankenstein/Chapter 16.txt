LINE 1: "Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I
LINE 2: not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
LINE 3: bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
LINE 4: feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have
LINE 5: destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
LINE 6: their shrieks and misery.
LINE 7: "When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
LINE 8: now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
LINE 9: anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken
LINE 10: the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
LINE 11: through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable
LINE 12: night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
LINE 13: waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
LINE 14: burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest
LINE 15: or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
LINE 16: finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
LINE 17: havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
LINE 18: the ruin.
LINE 19: "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
LINE 20: fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
LINE 21: the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men
LINE 22: that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
LINE 23: towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
LINE 24: against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
LINE 25: and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
LINE 26: "The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was
LINE 27: impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid
LINE 28: myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
LINE 29: to reflection on my situation.
LINE 30: "The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
LINE 31: degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
LINE 32: cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
LINE 33: conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that
LINE 34: my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a
LINE 35: fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I
LINE 36: ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
LINE 37: have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
LINE 38: been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be
LINE 39: irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
LINE 40: cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
LINE 41: party.
LINE 42: "These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
LINE 43: sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
LINE 44: peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
LINE 45: acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix
LINE 46: tearing me from his father's feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that
LINE 47: it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
LINE 48: search of food.
LINE 49: "When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
LINE 50: well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.
LINE 51: I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
LINE 52: accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun
LINE 53: mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I
LINE 54: trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside
LINE 55: of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the
LINE 56: agony of this suspense.
LINE 57: "Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
LINE 58: entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
LINE 59: understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
LINE 60: which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix
LINE 61: approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
LINE 62: quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
LINE 63: his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
LINE 64: "'Do you consider,' said his companion to him,
LINE 65: 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose
LINE 66: the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
LINE 67: I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
LINE 68: determination.'
LINE 69: "'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can
LINE 70: never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest
LINE 71: danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and
LINE 72: my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason
LINE 73: with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
LINE 74: place.'
LINE 75: "Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion
LINE 76: entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
LINE 77: departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
LINE 78: "I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
LINE 79: utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken
LINE 80: the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the
LINE 81: feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
LINE 82: control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
LINE 83: bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,
LINE 84: of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
LINE 85: exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
LINE 86: tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had
LINE 87: spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
LINE 88: injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As
LINE 89: night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
LINE 90: and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
LINE 91: I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
LINE 92: operations.
LINE 93: "As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
LINE 94: dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
LINE 95: along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
LINE 96: spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the
LINE 97: dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
LINE 98: my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
LINE 99: nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
LINE 100: brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,
LINE 101: and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the
LINE 102: cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
LINE 103: licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.
LINE 104: "As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
LINE 105: the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.
LINE 106: "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
LINE 107: resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
LINE 108: and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the
LINE 109: thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you
LINE 110: were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
LINE 111: than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had
LINE 112: bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from
LINE 113: these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
LINE 114: You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
LINE 115: this place I resolved to proceed.
LINE 116: "But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
LINE 117: southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
LINE 118: only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
LINE 119: through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
LINE 120: did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although
LINE 121: towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,
LINE 122: heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
LINE 123: and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
LINE 124: But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
LINE 125: determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
LINE 126: any other being that wore the human form.
LINE 127: "My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was
LINE 128: late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
LINE 129: I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
LINE 130: human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
LINE 131: rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
LINE 132: of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,
LINE 133: earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The
LINE 134: mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
LINE 135: and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
LINE 136: deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow
LINE 137: fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents
LINE 138: now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
LINE 139: often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me
LINE 140: no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
LINE 141: not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
LINE 142: on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
LINE 143: and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
LINE 144: manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
LINE 145: "I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
LINE 146: secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding
LINE 147: that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
LINE 148: after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
LINE 149: cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
LINE 150: the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
LINE 151: appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of
LINE 152: these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
LINE 153: forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears
LINE 154: again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
LINE 155: thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
LINE 156: "I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
LINE 157: boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
LINE 158: of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
LINE 159: Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
LINE 160: the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
LINE 161: of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
LINE 162: towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
LINE 163: someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides
LINE 164: of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
LINE 165: rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
LINE 166: from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She
LINE 167: was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
LINE 168: animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
LINE 169: who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On
LINE 170: seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
LINE 171: hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I
LINE 172: hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
LINE 173: which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my
LINE 174: injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
LINE 175: "This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being
LINE 176: from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable
LINE 177: pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of
LINE 178: kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments
LINE 179: before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by
LINE 180: pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the
LINE 181: agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
LINE 182: "For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
LINE 183: cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,
LINE 184: and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
LINE 185: rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented
LINE 186: also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
LINE 187: infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,
LINE 188: such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
LINE 189: endured.
LINE 190: "After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The
LINE 191: labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
LINE 192: gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
LINE 193: desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
LINE 194: the enjoyment of pleasure.
LINE 195: "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
LINE 196: reached the environs of Geneva.
LINE 197: "It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
LINE 198: the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
LINE 199: to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
LINE 200: enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
LINE 201: behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
LINE 202: "At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
LINE 203: which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
LINE 204: running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
LINE 205: infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
LINE 206: little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
LINE 207: imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and
LINE 208: educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
LINE 209: this peopled earth.
LINE 210: "Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
LINE 211: towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
LINE 212: his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his
LINE 213: face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to
LINE 214: hurt you; listen to me.'
LINE 215: "He struggled violently. 'Let me go,' he cried;
LINE 216: 'monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You
LINE 217: are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.'
LINE 218: "'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.'
LINE 219: "'Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.
LINE 220: Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.'
LINE 221: "'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have
LINE 222: sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'
LINE 223: "The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
LINE 224: despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
LINE 225: moment he lay dead at my feet.
LINE 226: "I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
LINE 227: triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I too can create desolation;
LINE 228: my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
LINE 229: a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.'
LINE 230: "As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
LINE 231: breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite
LINE 232: of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I
LINE 233: gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
LINE 234: lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
LINE 235: for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
LINE 236: bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
LINE 237: regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
LINE 238: expressive of disgust and affright.
LINE 239: "Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only
LINE 240: wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
LINE 241: exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
LINE 242: attempt to destroy them.
LINE 243: "While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
LINE 244: committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
LINE 245: entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
LINE 246: sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
LINE 247: whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
LINE 248: loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose
LINE 249: joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over
LINE 250: her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would
LINE 251: give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
LINE 252: beloved, awake!'
LINE 253: "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
LINE 254: indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus
LINE 255: would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
LINE 256: The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but
LINE 257: she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever
LINE 258: robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had
LINE 259: its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of
LINE 260: Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
LINE 261: mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
LINE 262: the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.
LINE 263: "For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
LINE 264: sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
LINE 265: its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,
LINE 266: and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
LINE 267: passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have
LINE 268: promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man
LINE 269: will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
LINE 270: would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species
LINE 271: and have the same defects. This being you must create."
