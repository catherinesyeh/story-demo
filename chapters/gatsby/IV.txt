LINE 1: On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,
LINE 2: the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled
LINE 3: hilariously on his lawn.
LINE 4: "He's a bootlegger," said the young ladies, moving somewhere between
LINE 5: his cocktails and his flowers. "One time he killed a man who had found
LINE 6: out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the
LINE 7: devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there
LINE 8: crystal glass."
LINE 9: Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of
LINE 10: those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old timetable
LINE 11: now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed "This schedule in effect
LINE 12: July 5th, 1922." But I can still read the grey names, and they will
LINE 13: give you a better impression than my generalities of those who
LINE 14: accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of
LINE 15: knowing nothing whatever about him.
LINE 16: From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a
LINE 17: man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who
LINE 18: was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie
LINE 19: Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a
LINE 20: corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came
LINE 21: near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and
LINE 22: Mr. Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned
LINE 23: cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.
LINE 24: Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,
LINE 25: in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the
LINE 26: garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.
LINE 27: R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the
LINE 28: Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he
LINE 29: went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that
LINE 30: Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies
LINE 31: came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice
LINE 32: A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and
LINE 33: Beluga's girls.
LINE 34: From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and
LINE 35: Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who
LINE 36: controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don
LINE 37: S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the
LINE 38: movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.
LINE 39: Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his
LINE 40: wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.
LINE 41: ("Rot-Gut") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to
LINE 42: gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was
LINE 43: cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably
LINE 44: next day.
LINE 45: A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as
LINE 46: "the boarder"—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people
LINE 47: there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Myer and George
LINE 48: Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the
LINE 49: Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and
LINE 50: the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the
LINE 51: Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who
LINE 52: killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.
LINE 53: Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite
LINE 54: the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with
LINE 55: another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have
LINE 56: forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria
LINE 57: or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names
LINE 58: of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American
LINE 59: capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves
LINE 60: to be.
LINE 61: In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came
LINE 62: there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had
LINE 63: his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,
LINE 64: his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of
LINE 65: the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be
LINE 66: her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and
LINE 67: whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.
LINE 68: All these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.
LINE 69: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 70: At nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car
LINE 71: lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody
LINE 72: from its three-noted horn.
LINE 73: It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of
LINE 74: his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,
LINE 75: made frequent use of his beach.
LINE 76: "Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I
LINE 77: thought we'd ride up together."
LINE 78: He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that
LINE 79: resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,
LINE 80: I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,
LINE 81: with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality
LINE 82: was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape
LINE 83: of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping
LINE 84: foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.
LINE 85: He saw me looking with admiration at his car.
LINE 86: "It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?" He jumped off to give me a better
LINE 87: view. "Haven't you ever seen it before?"
LINE 88: I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright
LINE 89: with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with
LINE 90: triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with
LINE 91: a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down
LINE 92: behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,
LINE 93: we started to town.
LINE 94: I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and
LINE 95: found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first
LINE 96: impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had
LINE 97: gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an
LINE 98: elaborate roadhouse next door.
LINE 99: And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg
LINE 100: village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished
LINE 101: and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured
LINE 102: suit.
LINE 103: "Look here, old sport," he broke out surprisingly, "what's your
LINE 104: opinion of me, anyhow?"
LINE 105: A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that
LINE 106: question deserves.
LINE 107: "Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life," he interrupted.
LINE 108: "I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you
LINE 109: hear."
LINE 110: So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation
LINE 111: in his halls.
LINE 112: "I'll tell you God's truth." His right hand suddenly ordered divine
LINE 113: retribution to stand by. "I am the son of some wealthy people in the
LINE 114: Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at
LINE 115: Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many
LINE 116: years. It is a family tradition."
LINE 117: He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he
LINE 118: was lying. He hurried the phrase "educated at Oxford," or swallowed
LINE 119: it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with
LINE 120: this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if
LINE 121: there wasn't something a little sinister about him, after all.
LINE 122: "What part of the Middle West?" I inquired casually.
LINE 123: "San Francisco."
LINE 124: "I see."
LINE 125: "My family all died and I came into a good deal of money."
LINE 126: His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a
LINE 127: clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling
LINE 128: my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.
LINE 129: "After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of
LINE 130: Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting
LINE 131: big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to
LINE 132: forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."
LINE 133: With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very
LINE 134: phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that
LINE 135: of a turbaned "character" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued
LINE 136: a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.
LINE 137: "Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very
LINE 138: hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a
LINE 139: commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I
LINE 140: took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there
LINE 141: was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't
LINE 142: advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty
LINE 143: men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last
LINE 144: they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of
LINE 145: dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave
LINE 146: me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the
LINE 147: Adriatic Sea!"
LINE 148: Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his
LINE 149: smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and
LINE 150: sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It
LINE 151: appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had
LINE 152: elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My
LINE 153: incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming
LINE 154: hastily through a dozen magazines.
LINE 155: He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,
LINE 156: fell into my palm.
LINE 157: "That's the one from Montenegro."
LINE 158: To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. "Orderi di
LINE 159: Danilo," ran the circular legend, "Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."
LINE 160: "Turn it."
LINE 161: "Major Jay Gatsby," I read, "For Valour Extraordinary."
LINE 162: "Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It
LINE 163: was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of
LINE 164: Doncaster."
LINE 165: It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an
LINE 166: archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,
LINE 167: looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.
LINE 168: Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace
LINE 169: on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with
LINE 170: their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.
LINE 171: "I'm going to make a big request of you today," he said, pocketing his
LINE 172: souvenirs with satisfaction, "so I thought you ought to know something
LINE 173: about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,
LINE 174: I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there
LINE 175: trying to forget the sad things that happened to me." He hesitated.
LINE 176: "You'll hear about it this afternoon."
LINE 177: "At lunch?"
LINE 178: "No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss
LINE 179: Baker to tea."
LINE 180: "Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?"
LINE 181: "No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak
LINE 182: to you about this matter."
LINE 183: I hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter" was, but I was more
LINE 184: annoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to
LINE 185: discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something
LINE 186: utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon
LINE 187: his overpopulated lawn.
LINE 188: He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared
LINE 189: the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of
LINE 190: red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with
LINE 191: the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.
LINE 192: Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a
LINE 193: glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting
LINE 194: vitality as we went by.
LINE 195: With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half
LINE 196: Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated
LINE 197: I heard the familiar "jug-jug-spat!" of a motorcycle, and a frantic
LINE 198: policeman rode alongside.
LINE 199: "All right, old sport," called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white
LINE 200: card from his wallet, he waved it before the man's eyes.
LINE 201: "Right you are," agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. "Know you next
LINE 202: time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!"
LINE 203: "What was that?" I inquired. "The picture of Oxford?"
LINE 204: "I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a
LINE 205: Christmas card every year."
LINE 206: Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a
LINE 207: constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across
LINE 208: the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of
LINE 209: nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always
LINE 210: the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the
LINE 211: mystery and the beauty in the world.
LINE 212: A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two
LINE 213: carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for
LINE 214: friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short
LINE 215: upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of
LINE 216: Gatsby's splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we
LINE 217: crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white
LINE 218: chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
LINE 219: laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
LINE 220: haughty rivalry.
LINE 221: "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
LINE 222: "anything at all …"
LINE 223: Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.
LINE 224: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 225: Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby
LINE 226: for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes
LINE 227: picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.
LINE 228: "Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem."
LINE 229: A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two
LINE 230: fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a
LINE 231: moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.
LINE 232: "—So I took one look at him," said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand
LINE 233: earnestly, "and what do you think I did?"
LINE 234: "What?" I inquired politely.
LINE 235: But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and
LINE 236: covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.
LINE 237: "I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: 'All right, Katspaugh,
LINE 238: don't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and
LINE 239: there."
LINE 240: Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the
LINE 241: restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was
LINE 242: starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.
LINE 243: "Highballs?" asked the head waiter.
LINE 244: "This is a nice restaurant here," said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the
LINE 245: presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. "But I like across the street
LINE 246: better!"
LINE 247: "Yes, highballs," agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: "It's too
LINE 248: hot over there."
LINE 249: "Hot and small—yes," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "but full of memories."
LINE 250: "What place is that?" I asked.
LINE 251: "The old Metropole."
LINE 252: "The old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. "Filled with
LINE 253: faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't
LINE 254: forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It
LINE 255: was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all
LINE 256: evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a
LINE 257: funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All
LINE 258: right,' says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his
LINE 259: chair.
LINE 260: " 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't
LINE 261: you, so help me, move outside this room.'
LINE 262: "It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the
LINE 263: blinds we'd of seen daylight."
LINE 264: "Did he go?" I asked innocently.
LINE 265: "Sure he went." Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me indignantly. "He
LINE 266: turned around in the door and says: 'Don't let that waiter take away
LINE 267: my coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three
LINE 268: times in his full belly and drove away."
LINE 269: "Four of them were electrocuted," I said, remembering.
LINE 270: "Five, with Becker." His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.
LINE 271: "I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion."
LINE 272: The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered
LINE 273: for me:
LINE 274: "Oh, no," he exclaimed, "this isn't the man."
LINE 275: "No?" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.
LINE 276: "This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other
LINE 277: time."
LINE 278: "I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "I had a wrong man."
LINE 279: A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more
LINE 280: sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with
LINE 281: ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around
LINE 282: the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people
LINE 283: directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have
LINE 284: taken one short glance beneath our own table.
LINE 285: "Look here, old sport," said Gatsby, leaning toward me, "I'm afraid I
LINE 286: made you a little angry this morning in the car."
LINE 287: There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.
LINE 288: "I don't like mysteries," I answered, "and I don't understand why you
LINE 289: won't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got
LINE 290: to come through Miss Baker?"
LINE 291: "Oh, it's nothing underhand," he assured me. "Miss Baker's a great
LINE 292: sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all
LINE 293: right."
LINE 294: Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,
LINE 295: leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.
LINE 296: "He has to telephone," said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his
LINE 297: eyes. "Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect
LINE 298: gentleman."
LINE 299: "Yes."
LINE 300: "He's an Oggsford man."
LINE 301: "Oh!"
LINE 302: "He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?"
LINE 303: "I've heard of it."
LINE 304: "It's one of the most famous colleges in the world."
LINE 305: "Have you known Gatsby for a long time?" I inquired.
LINE 306: "Several years," he answered in a gratified way. "I made the pleasure
LINE 307: of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a
LINE 308: man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to
LINE 309: myself: 'There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce
LINE 310: to your mother and sister.' " He paused. "I see you're looking at my
LINE 311: cuff buttons."
LINE 312: I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of
LINE 313: oddly familiar pieces of ivory.
LINE 314: "Finest specimens of human molars," he informed me.
LINE 315: "Well!" I inspected them. "That's a very interesting idea."
LINE 316: "Yeah." He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby's very
LINE 317: careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's
LINE 318: wife."
LINE 319: When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and
LINE 320: sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his
LINE 321: feet.
LINE 322: "I have enjoyed my lunch," he said, "and I'm going to run off from you
LINE 323: two young men before I outstay my welcome."
LINE 324: "Don't hurry Meyer," said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem
LINE 325: raised his hand in a sort of benediction.
LINE 326: "You're very polite, but I belong to another generation," he announced
LINE 327: solemnly. "You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies
LINE 328: and your—" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his
LINE 329: hand. "As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on
LINE 330: you any longer."
LINE 331: As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I
LINE 332: wondered if I had said anything to offend him.
LINE 333: "He becomes very sentimental sometimes," explained Gatsby. "This is
LINE 334: one of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York—a
LINE 335: denizen of Broadway."
LINE 336: "Who is he, anyhow, an actor?"
LINE 337: "No."
LINE 338: "A dentist?"
LINE 339: "Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a gambler." Gatsby hesitated, then added,
LINE 340: coolly: "He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919."
LINE 341: "Fixed the World's Series?" I repeated.
LINE 342: The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World's
LINE 343: Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I
LINE 344: would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of
LINE 345: some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could
LINE 346: start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the
LINE 347: single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.
LINE 348: "How did he happen to do that?" I asked after a minute.
LINE 349: "He just saw the opportunity."
LINE 350: "Why isn't he in jail?"
LINE 351: "They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man."
LINE 352: I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I
LINE 353: caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.
LINE 354: "Come along with me for a minute," I said; "I've got to say hello to
LINE 355: someone."
LINE 356: When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our
LINE 357: direction.
LINE 358: "Where've you been?" he demanded eagerly. "Daisy's furious because you
LINE 359: haven't called up."
LINE 360: "This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan."
LINE 361: They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of
LINE 362: embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.
LINE 363: "How've you been, anyhow?" demanded Tom of me. "How'd you happen to
LINE 364: come up this far to eat?"
LINE 365: "I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby."
LINE 366: I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.
LINE 367: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 368: One October day in nineteen-seventeen—
LINE 369: (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a
LINE 370: straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)
LINE 371: —I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks
LINE 372: and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on
LINE 373: shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the
LINE 374: soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the
LINE 375: wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in
LINE 376: front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,
LINE 377: in a disapproving way.
LINE 378: The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to
LINE 379: Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and
LINE 380: by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She
LINE 381: dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long
LINE 382: the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp
LINE 383: Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that
LINE 384: night. "Anyways, for an hour!"
LINE 385: When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was
LINE 386: beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had
LINE 387: never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she
LINE 388: didn't see me until I was five feet away.
LINE 389: "Hello, Jordan," she called unexpectedly. "Please come here."
LINE 390: I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the
LINE 391: older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red
LINE 392: Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she
LINE 393: couldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was
LINE 394: speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at
LINE 395: sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
LINE 396: incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn't lay eyes on
LINE 397: him again for over four years—even after I'd met him on Long Island I
LINE 398: didn't realize it was the same man.
LINE 399: That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux
LINE 400: myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very
LINE 401: often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone
LINE 402: at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had
LINE 403: found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
LINE 404: goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually
LINE 405: prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for
LINE 406: several weeks. After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any
LINE 407: more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,
LINE 408: who couldn't get into the army at all.
LINE 409: By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début
LINE 410: after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a
LINE 411: man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,
LINE 412: with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He
LINE 413: came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a
LINE 414: whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he
LINE 415: gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand
LINE 416: dollars.
LINE 417: I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the
LINE 418: bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June
LINE 419: night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle
LINE 420: of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.
LINE 421: " 'Gratulate me," she muttered. "Never had a drink before, but oh how
LINE 422: I do enjoy it."
LINE 423: "What's the matter, Daisy?"
LINE 424: I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.
LINE 425: "Here, dearies." She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her
LINE 426: on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. "Take 'em downstairs
LINE 427: and give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's
LINE 428: change' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's change' her mine!' "
LINE 429: She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her
LINE 430: mother's maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.
LINE 431: She wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her
LINE 432: and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the
LINE 433: soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.
LINE 434: But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and
LINE 435: put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half
LINE 436: an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around
LINE 437: her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she
LINE 438: married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a
LINE 439: three months' trip to the South Seas.
LINE 440: I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I'd
LINE 441: never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a
LINE 442: minute she'd look around uneasily, and say: "Where's Tom gone?" and
LINE 443: wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the
LINE 444: door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the
LINE 445: hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with
LINE 446: unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you
LINE 447: laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I
LINE 448: left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,
LINE 449: and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got
LINE 450: into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the
LINE 451: chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.
LINE 452: The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for
LINE 453: a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and
LINE 454: then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in
LINE 455: Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young
LINE 456: and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect
LINE 457: reputation. Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage
LINE 458: not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,
LINE 459: moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that
LINE 460: everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy
LINE 461: never went in for amour at all—and yet there's something in that voice
LINE 462: of hers …
LINE 463: Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first
LINE 464: time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew
LINE 465: Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and
LINE 466: woke me up, and said: "What Gatsby?" and when I described him—I was
LINE 467: half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man
LINE 468: she used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby
LINE 469: with the officer in her white car.
LINE 470: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 471: When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza
LINE 472: for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.
LINE 473: The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in
LINE 474: the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered
LINE 475: like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:
LINE 476: "I'm the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when
LINE 477: you're asleep Into your tent I'll creep—"
LINE 478: "It was a strange coincidence," I said.
LINE 479: "But it wasn't a coincidence at all."
LINE 480: "Why not?"
LINE 481: "Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay."
LINE 482: Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that
LINE 483: June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of
LINE 484: his purposeless splendour.
LINE 485: "He wants to know," continued Jordan, "if you'll invite Daisy to your
LINE 486: house some afternoon and then let him come over."
LINE 487: The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and
LINE 488: bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that
LINE 489: he could "come over" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.
LINE 490: "Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?"
LINE 491: "He's afraid, he's waited so long. He thought you might be
LINE 492: offended. You see, he's regular tough underneath it all."
LINE 493: Something worried me.
LINE 494: "Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"
LINE 495: "He wants her to see his house," she explained. "And your house is
LINE 496: right next door."
LINE 497: "Oh!"
LINE 498: "I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some
LINE 499: night," went on Jordan, "but she never did. Then he began asking
LINE 500: people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It
LINE 501: was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard
LINE 502: the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately
LINE 503: suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he'd go mad:
LINE 504: " 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I
LINE 505: want to see her right next door.'
LINE 506: "When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's, he started to
LINE 507: abandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he
LINE 508: says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of
LINE 509: catching a glimpse of Daisy's name."
LINE 510: It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm
LINE 511: around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her
LINE 512: to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,
LINE 513: but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal
LINE 514: scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my
LINE 515: arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady
LINE 516: excitement: "There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and
LINE 517: the tired."
LINE 518: "And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to
LINE 519: me.
LINE 520: "Does she want to see Gatsby?"
LINE 521: "She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're
LINE 522: just supposed to invite her to tea."
LINE 523: We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth
LINE 524: Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.
LINE 525: Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face
LINE 526: floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up
LINE 527: the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth
LINE 528: smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.
