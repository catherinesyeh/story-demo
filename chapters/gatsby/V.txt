LINE 1: When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
LINE 2: my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the
LINE 3: peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery
LINE 4: and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a
LINE 5: corner, I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.
LINE 6: At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved
LINE 7: itself into "hide-and-go-seek" or "sardines-in-the-box" with all the
LINE 8: house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in
LINE 9: the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on
LINE 10: again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned
LINE 11: away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.
LINE 12: "Your place looks like the World's Fair," I said.
LINE 13: "Does it?" He turned his eyes toward it absently. "I have been
LINE 14: glancing into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old
LINE 15: sport. In my car."
LINE 16: "It's too late."
LINE 17: "Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made
LINE 18: use of it all summer."
LINE 19: "I've got to go to bed."
LINE 20: "All right."
LINE 21: He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.
LINE 22: "I talked with Miss Baker," I said after a moment. "I'm going to call
LINE 23: up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea."
LINE 24: "Oh, that's all right," he said carelessly. "I don't want to put you
LINE 25: to any trouble."
LINE 26: "What day would suit you?"
LINE 27: "What day would suit you?" he corrected me quickly. "I don't want to
LINE 28: put you to any trouble, you see."
LINE 29: "How about the day after tomorrow?"
LINE 30: He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: "I want to get the
LINE 31: grass cut," he said.
LINE 32: We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my
LINE 33: ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I
LINE 34: suspected that he meant my grass.
LINE 35: "There's another little thing," he said uncertainly, and hesitated.
LINE 36: "Would you rather put it off for a few days?" I asked.
LINE 37: "Oh, it isn't about that. At least—" He fumbled with a series of
LINE 38: beginnings. "Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don't make
LINE 39: much money, do you?"
LINE 40: "Not very much."
LINE 41: This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.
LINE 42: "I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my—you see, I carry on a
LINE 43: little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And
LINE 44: I thought that if you don't make very much—You're selling bonds,
LINE 45: aren't you, old sport?"
LINE 46: "Trying to."
LINE 47: "Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your time
LINE 48: and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather
LINE 49: confidential sort of thing."
LINE 50: I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation
LINE 51: might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer
LINE 52: was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no
LINE 53: choice except to cut him off there.
LINE 54: "I've got my hands full," I said. "I'm much obliged but I couldn't
LINE 55: take on any more work."
LINE 56: "You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem." Evidently he
LINE 57: thought that I was shying away from the "gonnegtion" mentioned at
LINE 58: lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,
LINE 59: hoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be
LINE 60: responsive, so he went unwillingly home.
LINE 61: The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a
LINE 62: deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don't know whether or not
LINE 63: Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he "glanced into
LINE 64: rooms" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the
LINE 65: office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.
LINE 66: "Don't bring Tom," I warned her.
LINE 67: "What?"
LINE 68: "Don't bring Tom."
LINE 69: "Who is 'Tom'?" she asked innocently.
LINE 70: The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a
LINE 71: raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that
LINE 72: Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I
LINE 73: had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg
LINE 74: Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy
LINE 75: some cups and lemons and flowers.
LINE 76: The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived
LINE 77: from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour
LINE 78: later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel
LINE 79: suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,
LINE 80: and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.
LINE 81: "Is everything all right?" he asked immediately.
LINE 82: "The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean."
LINE 83: "What grass?" he inquired blankly. "Oh, the grass in the yard." He
LINE 84: looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don't
LINE 85: believe he saw a thing.
LINE 86: "Looks very good," he remarked vaguely. "One of the papers said they
LINE 87: thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The
LINE 88: Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?"
LINE 89: I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at
LINE 90: the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the
LINE 91: delicatessen shop.
LINE 92: "Will they do?" I asked.
LINE 93: "Of course, of course! They're fine!" and he added hollowly, "… old
LINE 94: sport."
LINE 95: The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which
LINE 96: occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes
LINE 97: through a copy of Clay's Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that
LINE 98: shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from
LINE 99: time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were
LINE 100: taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an
LINE 101: uncertain voice, that he was going home.
LINE 102: "Why's that?"
LINE 103: "Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!" He looked at his watch as if
LINE 104: there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. "I can't wait
LINE 105: all day."
LINE 106: "Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four."
LINE 107: He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously
LINE 108: there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped
LINE 109: up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.
LINE 110: Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the
LINE 111: drive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a
LINE 112: three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic
LINE 113: smile.
LINE 114: "Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?"
LINE 115: The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I
LINE 116: had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear
LINE 117: alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a
LINE 118: dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with
LINE 119: glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.
LINE 120: "Are you in love with me," she said low in my ear, "or why did I have
LINE 121: to come alone?"
LINE 122: "That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far
LINE 123: away and spend an hour."
LINE 124: "Come back in an hour, Ferdie." Then in a grave murmur: "His name is
LINE 125: Ferdie."
LINE 126: "Does the gasoline affect his nose?"
LINE 127: "I don't think so," she said innocently. "Why?"
LINE 128: We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.
LINE 129: "Well, that's funny," I exclaimed.
LINE 130: "What's funny?"
LINE 131: She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the
LINE 132: front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his
LINE 133: hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a
LINE 134: puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.
LINE 135: With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the
LINE 136: hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the
LINE 137: living-room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my
LINE 138: own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.
LINE 139: For half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living-room I
LINE 140: heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by
LINE 141: Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note:
LINE 142: "I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."
LINE 143: A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I
LINE 144: went into the room.
LINE 145: Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the
LINE 146: mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of
LINE 147: boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face
LINE 148: of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught
LINE 149: eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,
LINE 150: on the edge of a stiff chair.
LINE 151: "We've met before," muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at
LINE 152: me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily
LINE 153: the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his
LINE 154: head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and
LINE 155: set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm
LINE 156: of the sofa and his chin in his hand.
LINE 157: "I'm sorry about the clock," he said.
LINE 158: My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up
LINE 159: a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.
LINE 160: "It's an old clock," I told them idiotically.
LINE 161: I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on
LINE 162: the floor.
LINE 163: "We haven't met for many years," said Daisy, her voice as
LINE 164: matter-of-fact as it could ever be.
LINE 165: "Five years next November."
LINE 166: The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least
LINE 167: another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate
LINE 168: suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac
LINE 169: Finn brought it in on a tray.
LINE 170: Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical
LINE 171: decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,
LINE 172: while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other
LINE 173: of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in
LINE 174: itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my
LINE 175: feet.
LINE 176: "Where are you going?" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.
LINE 177: "I'll be back."
LINE 178: "I've got to speak to you about something before you go."
LINE 179: He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and
LINE 180: whispered: "Oh, God!" in a miserable way.
LINE 181: "What's the matter?"
LINE 182: "This is a terrible mistake," he said, shaking his head from side to
LINE 183: side, "a terrible, terrible mistake."
LINE 184: "You're just embarrassed, that's all," and luckily I added: "Daisy's
LINE 185: embarrassed too."
LINE 186: "She's embarrassed?" he repeated incredulously.
LINE 187: "Just as much as you are."
LINE 188: "Don't talk so loud."
LINE 189: "You're acting like a little boy," I broke out impatiently. "Not only
LINE 190: that, but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone."
LINE 191: He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable
LINE 192: reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other
LINE 193: room.
LINE 194: I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his
LINE 195: nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge
LINE 196: black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the
LINE 197: rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by
LINE 198: Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric
LINE 199: marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except
LINE 200: Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church
LINE 201: steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the "period"
LINE 202: craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay
LINE 203: five years' taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would
LINE 204: have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the
LINE 205: heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate
LINE 206: decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on
LINE 207: the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have
LINE 208: always been obstinate about being peasantry.
LINE 209: After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer's automobile
LINE 210: rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants'
LINE 211: dinner—I felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening
LINE 212: the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,
LINE 213: leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the
LINE 214: garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had
LINE 215: seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little
LINE 216: now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that
LINE 217: silence had fallen within the house too.
LINE 218: I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of
LINE 219: pushing over the stove—but I don't believe they heard a sound. They
LINE 220: were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if
LINE 221: some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of
LINE 222: embarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears, and when
LINE 223: I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief
LINE 224: before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply
LINE 225: confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of
LINE 226: exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little
LINE 227: room.
LINE 228: "Oh, hello, old sport," he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I
LINE 229: thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.
LINE 230: "It's stopped raining."
LINE 231: "Has it?" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were
LINE 232: twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,
LINE 233: like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to
LINE 234: Daisy. "What do you think of that? It's stopped raining."
LINE 235: "I'm glad, Jay." Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told
LINE 236: only of her unexpected joy.
LINE 237: "I want you and Daisy to come over to my house," he said, "I'd like to
LINE 238: show her around."
LINE 239: "You're sure you want me to come?"
LINE 240: "Absolutely, old sport."
LINE 241: Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with
LINE 242: humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.
LINE 243: "My house looks well, doesn't it?" he demanded. "See how the whole
LINE 244: front of it catches the light."
LINE 245: I agreed that it was splendid.
LINE 246: "Yes." His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. "It
LINE 247: took me just three years to earn the money that bought it."
LINE 248: "I thought you inherited your money."
LINE 249: "I did, old sport," he said automatically, "but I lost most of it in
LINE 250: the big panic—the panic of the war."
LINE 251: I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what
LINE 252: business he was in he answered: "That's my affair," before he realized
LINE 253: that it wasn't an appropriate reply.
LINE 254: "Oh, I've been in several things," he corrected himself. "I was in the
LINE 255: drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in
LINE 256: either one now." He looked at me with more attention. "Do you mean
LINE 257: you've been thinking over what I proposed the other night?"
LINE 258: Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of
LINE 259: brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.
LINE 260: "That huge place there?" she cried pointing.
LINE 261: "Do you like it?"
LINE 262: "I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone."
LINE 263: "I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People
LINE 264: who do interesting things. Celebrated people."
LINE 265: Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the
LINE 266: road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy
LINE 267: admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,
LINE 268: admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy
LINE 269: odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of
LINE 270: kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find
LINE 271: no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but
LINE 272: bird voices in the trees.
LINE 273: And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and
LINE 274: Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind
LINE 275: every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we
LINE 276: had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of "the Merton College
LINE 277: Library" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
LINE 278: ghostly laughter.
LINE 279: We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender
LINE 280: silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,
LINE 281: and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a
LINE 282: dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It
LINE 283: was Mr. Klipspringer, the "boarder." I had seen him wandering hungrily
LINE 284: about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own
LINE 285: apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam's study, where we sat
LINE 286: down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in
LINE 287: the wall.
LINE 288: He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued
LINE 289: everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew
LINE 290: from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his
LINE 291: possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding
LINE 292: presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a
LINE 293: flight of stairs.
LINE 294: His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was
LINE 295: garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush
LINE 296: with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and
LINE 297: shaded his eyes and began to laugh.
LINE 298: "It's the funniest thing, old sport," he said hilariously. "I
LINE 299: can't—When I try to—"
LINE 300: He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a
LINE 301: third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed
LINE 302: with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,
LINE 303: dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to
LINE 304: speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,
LINE 305: he was running down like an over-wound clock.
LINE 306: Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent
LINE 307: cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and
LINE 308: his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.
LINE 309: "I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a
LINE 310: selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall."
LINE 311: He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,
LINE 312: before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,
LINE 313: which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in
LINE 314: many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft
LINE 315: rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in
LINE 316: coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of
LINE 317: indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into
LINE 318: the shirts and began to cry stormily.
LINE 319: "They're such beautiful shirts," she sobbed, her voice muffled in the
LINE 320: thick folds. "It makes me sad because I've never seen such—such
LINE 321: beautiful shirts before."
LINE 322: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 323: After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and
LINE 324: the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby's window
LINE 325: it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated
LINE 326: surface of the Sound.
LINE 327: "If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,"
LINE 328: said Gatsby. "You always have a green light that burns all night at
LINE 329: the end of your dock."
LINE 330: Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what
LINE 331: he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal
LINE 332: significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the
LINE 333: great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very
LINE 334: near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to
LINE 335: the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of
LINE 336: enchanted objects had diminished by one.
LINE 337: I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects
LINE 338: in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting
LINE 339: costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.
LINE 340: "Who's this?"
LINE 341: "That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport."
LINE 342: The name sounded faintly familiar.
LINE 343: "He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago."
LINE 344: There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the
LINE 345: bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently
LINE 346: when he was about eighteen.
LINE 347: "I adore it," exclaimed Daisy. "The pompadour! You never told me you
LINE 348: had a pompadour—or a yacht."
LINE 349: "Look at this," said Gatsby quickly. "Here's a lot of clippings—about
LINE 350: you."
LINE 351: They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the
LINE 352: rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.
LINE 353: "Yes … Well, I can't talk now … I can't talk now, old sport … I said a
LINE 354: small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he's no use to
LINE 355: us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …"
LINE 356: He rang off.
LINE 357: "Come here quick!" cried Daisy at the window.
LINE 358: The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,
LINE 359: and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.
LINE 360: "Look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "I'd like to
LINE 361: just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you
LINE 362: around."
LINE 363: I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence
LINE 364: made them feel more satisfactorily alone.
LINE 365: "I know what we'll do," said Gatsby, "we'll have Klipspringer play the
LINE 366: piano."
LINE 367: He went out of the room calling "Ewing!" and returned in a few minutes
LINE 368: accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with
LINE 369: shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently
LINE 370: clothed in a "sport shirt," open at the neck, sneakers, and duck
LINE 371: trousers of a nebulous hue.
LINE 372: "Did we interrupt your exercise?" inquired Daisy politely.
LINE 373: "I was asleep," cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.
LINE 374: "That is, I'd been asleep. Then I got up …"
LINE 375: "Klipspringer plays the piano," said Gatsby, cutting him off. "Don't
LINE 376: you, Ewing, old sport?"
LINE 377: "I don't play well. I don't—hardly play at all. I'm all out of prac—"
LINE 378: "We'll go downstairs," interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The
LINE 379: grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.
LINE 380: In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.
LINE 381: He lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her
LINE 382: on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the
LINE 383: gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.
LINE 384: When Klipspringer had played "The Love Nest" he turned around on the
LINE 385: bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.
LINE 386: "I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all
LINE 387: out of prac—"
LINE 388: "Don't talk so much, old sport," commanded Gatsby. "Play!"
LINE 389: "In the morning, In the evening, Ain't we got fun—"
LINE 390: Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along
LINE 391: the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric
LINE 392: trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New
LINE 393: York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was
LINE 394: generating on the air.
LINE 395: "One thing's sure and nothing's surer The rich get richer and the
LINE 396: poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—"
LINE 397: As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of
LINE 398: bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt
LINE 399: had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost
LINE 400: five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when
LINE 401: Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but
LINE 402: because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond
LINE 403: her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative
LINE 404: passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright
LINE 405: feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can
LINE 406: challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.
LINE 407: As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took
LINE 408: hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned
LINE 409: toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,
LINE 410: with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn't be
LINE 411: over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.
LINE 412: They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;
LINE 413: Gatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they
LINE 414: looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went
LINE 415: out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them
LINE 416: there together.
