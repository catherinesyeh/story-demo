LINE 1: In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
LINE 2: that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
LINE 3: "Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just
LINE 4: remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages
LINE 5: that you've had."
LINE 6: He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative
LINE 7: in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more
LINE 8: than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a
LINE 9: habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me
LINE 10: the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
LINE 11: detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal
LINE 12: person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
LINE 13: being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
LINE 14: unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have
LINE 15: feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by
LINE 16: some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on
LINE 17: the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least
LINE 18: the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
LINE 19: marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of
LINE 20: infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I
LINE 21: forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly
LINE 22: repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out
LINE 23: unequally at birth.
LINE 24: And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
LINE 25: that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
LINE 26: wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded
LINE 27: on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted
LINE 28: the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
LINE 29: wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
LINE 30: human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was
LINE 31: exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I
LINE 32: have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of
LINE 33: successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
LINE 34: heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related
LINE 35: to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
LINE 36: thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that
LINE 37: flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
LINE 38: "creative temperament"—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
LINE 39: romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
LINE 40: which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out
LINE 41: all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
LINE 42: floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my
LINE 43: interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
LINE 44: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 45: My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle
LINE 46: Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a
LINE 47: clan, and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of
LINE 48: Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's
LINE 49: brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil
LINE 50: War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father
LINE 51: carries on today.
LINE 52: I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him—with
LINE 53: special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in
LINE 54: father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of
LINE 55: a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that
LINE 56: delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the
LINE 57: counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being
LINE 58: the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the
LINE 59: ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond
LINE 60: business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it
LINE 61: could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it
LINE 62: over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,
LINE 63: "Why—ye-es," with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
LINE 64: me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I
LINE 65: thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
LINE 66: The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm
LINE 67: season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly
LINE 68: trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a
LINE 69: house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He
LINE 70: found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a
LINE 71: month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and
LINE 72: I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a
LINE 73: few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who
LINE 74: made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to
LINE 75: herself over the electric stove.
LINE 76: It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more
LINE 77: recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
LINE 78: "How do you get to West Egg village?" he asked helplessly.
LINE 79: I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,
LINE 80: a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the
LINE 81: freedom of the neighbourhood.
LINE 82: And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
LINE 83: trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar
LINE 84: conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
LINE 85: There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to
LINE 86: be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen
LINE 87: volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they
LINE 88: stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,
LINE 89: promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and
LINE 90: Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other
LINE 91: books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a
LINE 92: series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now
LINE 93: I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become
LINE 94: again that most limited of all specialists, the "well-rounded man."
LINE 95: This isn't just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at
LINE 96: from a single window, after all.
LINE 97: It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of
LINE 98: the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender
LINE 99: riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where
LINE 100: there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of
LINE 101: land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
LINE 102: contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most
LINE 103: domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great
LINE 104: wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the
LINE 105: egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact
LINE 106: end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
LINE 107: wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more
LINE 108: interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular
LINE 109: except shape and size.
LINE 110: I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
LINE 111: this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little
LINE 112: sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the
LINE 113: egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge
LINE 114: places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on
LINE 115: my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual
LINE 116: imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one
LINE 117: side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble
LINE 118: swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was
LINE 119: Gatsby's mansion. Or, rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
LINE 120: mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an
LINE 121: eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I
LINE 122: had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour's lawn, and
LINE 123: the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a
LINE 124: month.
LINE 125: Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
LINE 126: glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins
LINE 127: on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom
LINE 128: Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I'd known Tom
LINE 129: in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in
LINE 130: Chicago.
LINE 131: Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of
LINE 132: the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a
LINE 133: national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute
LINE 134: limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of
LINE 135: anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his
LINE 136: freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he'd left Chicago
LINE 137: and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for
LINE 138: instance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake
LINE 139: Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was
LINE 140: wealthy enough to do that.
LINE 141: Why they came East I don't know. They had spent a year in France for
LINE 142: no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully
LINE 143: wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a
LINE 144: permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe
LINE 145: it—I had no sight into Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift
LINE 146: on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of
LINE 147: some irrecoverable football game.
LINE 148: And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East
LINE 149: Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house
LINE 150: was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white
LINE 151: Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at
LINE 152: the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,
LINE 153: jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when
LINE 154: it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though
LINE 155: from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French
LINE 156: windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm
LINE 157: windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with
LINE 158: his legs apart on the front porch.
LINE 159: He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy
LINE 160: straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a
LINE 161: supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established
LINE 162: dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
LINE 163: aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding
LINE 164: clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill
LINE 165: those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could
LINE 166: see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his
LINE 167: thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.
LINE 168: His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
LINE 169: fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in
LINE 170: it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who
LINE 171: had hated his guts.
LINE 172: "Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final," he seemed to
LINE 173: say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are." We
LINE 174: were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I
LINE 175: always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like
LINE 176: him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
LINE 177: We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
LINE 178: "I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes flashing about
LINE 179: restlessly.
LINE 180: Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the
LINE 181: front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
LINE 182: acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped
LINE 183: the tide offshore.
LINE 184: "It belonged to Demaine, the oil man." He turned me around again,
LINE 185: politely and abruptly. "We'll go inside."
LINE 186: We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,
LINE 187: fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The
LINE 188: windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside
LINE 189: that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through
LINE 190: the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale
LINE 191: flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the
LINE 192: ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow
LINE 193: on it as wind does on the sea.
LINE 194: The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous
LINE 195: couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an
LINE 196: anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were
LINE 197: rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a
LINE 198: short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments
LINE 199: listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a
LINE 200: picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the
LINE 201: rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the
LINE 202: curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the
LINE 203: floor.
LINE 204: The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full
LINE 205: length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her
LINE 206: chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which
LINE 207: was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes
LINE 208: she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring
LINE 209: an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.
LINE 210: The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly
LINE 211: forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,
LINE 212: charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the
LINE 213: room.
LINE 214: "I'm p-paralysed with happiness."
LINE 215: She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my
LINE 216: hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was
LINE 217: no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she
LINE 218: had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
LINE 219: Baker. (I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people
LINE 220: lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less
LINE 221: charming.)
LINE 222: At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
LINE 223: imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object
LINE 224: she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her
LINE 225: something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.
LINE 226: Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned
LINE 227: tribute from me.
LINE 228: I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
LINE 229: thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and
LINE 230: down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be
LINE 231: played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
LINE 232: bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement
LINE 233: in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:
LINE 234: a singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen," a promise that she had
LINE 235: done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
LINE 236: exciting things hovering in the next hour.
LINE 237: I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,
LINE 238: and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.
LINE 239: "Do they miss me?" she cried ecstatically.
LINE 240: "The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel
LINE 241: painted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all
LINE 242: night along the north shore."
LINE 243: "How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!" Then she added
LINE 244: irrelevantly: "You ought to see the baby."
LINE 245: "I'd like to."
LINE 246: "She's asleep. She's three years old. Haven't you ever seen her?"
LINE 247: "Never."
LINE 248: "Well, you ought to see her. She's—"
LINE 249: Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped
LINE 250: and rested his hand on my shoulder.
LINE 251: "What you doing, Nick?"
LINE 252: "I'm a bond man."
LINE 253: "Who with?"
LINE 254: I told him.
LINE 255: "Never heard of them," he remarked decisively.
LINE 256: This annoyed me.
LINE 257: "You will," I answered shortly. "You will if you stay in the East."
LINE 258: "Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry," he said, glancing at
LINE 259: Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something
LINE 260: more. "I'd be a God damned fool to live anywhere else."
LINE 261: At this point Miss Baker said: "Absolutely!" with such suddenness that
LINE 262: I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the
LINE 263: room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned
LINE 264: and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
LINE 265: "I'm stiff," she complained, "I've been lying on that sofa for as long
LINE 266: as I can remember."
LINE 267: "Don't look at me," Daisy retorted, "I've been trying to get you to
LINE 268: New York all afternoon."
LINE 269: "No, thanks," said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the
LINE 270: pantry. "I'm absolutely in training."
LINE 271: Her host looked at her incredulously.
LINE 272: "You are!" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom
LINE 273: of a glass. "How you ever get anything done is beyond me."
LINE 274: I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she "got done." I
LINE 275: enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with
LINE 276: an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward
LINE 277: at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked
LINE 278: back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,
LINE 279: discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
LINE 280: picture of her, somewhere before.
LINE 281: "You live in West Egg," she remarked contemptuously. "I know somebody
LINE 282: there."
LINE 283: "I don't know a single—"
LINE 284: "You must know Gatsby."
LINE 285: "Gatsby?" demanded Daisy. "What Gatsby?"
LINE 286: Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;
LINE 287: wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled
LINE 288: me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.
LINE 289: Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
LINE 290: young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward
LINE 291: the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the
LINE 292: diminished wind.
LINE 293: "Why candles?" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her
LINE 294: fingers. "In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year." She
LINE 295: looked at us all radiantly. "Do you always watch for the longest day
LINE 296: of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in
LINE 297: the year and then miss it."
LINE 298: "We ought to plan something," yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the
LINE 299: table as if she were getting into bed.
LINE 300: "All right," said Daisy. "What'll we plan?" She turned to me
LINE 301: helplessly: "What do people plan?"
LINE 302: Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her
LINE 303: little finger.
LINE 304: "Look!" she complained; "I hurt it."
LINE 305: We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.
LINE 306: "You did it, Tom," she said accusingly. "I know you didn't mean to,
LINE 307: but you did do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a
LINE 308: great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—"
LINE 309: "I hate that word 'hulking,' " objected Tom crossly, "even in
LINE 310: kidding."
LINE 311: "Hulking," insisted Daisy.
LINE 312: Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
LINE 313: bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool
LINE 314: as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all
LINE 315: desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a
LINE 316: polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew
LINE 317: that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too
LINE 318: would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the
LINE 319: West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its
LINE 320: close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer
LINE 321: nervous dread of the moment itself.
LINE 322: "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," I confessed on my second glass
LINE 323: of corky but rather impressive claret. "Can't you talk about crops or
LINE 324: something?"
LINE 325: I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in
LINE 326: an unexpected way.
LINE 327: "Civilization's going to pieces," broke out Tom violently. "I've
LINE 328: gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise
LINE 329: of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?"
LINE 330: "Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
LINE 331: "Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is
LINE 332: if we don't look out the white race will be—will be utterly
LINE 333: submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."
LINE 334: "Tom's getting very profound," said Daisy, with an expression of
LINE 335: unthoughtful sadness. "He reads deep books with long words in
LINE 336: them. What was that word we—"
LINE 337: "Well, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her
LINE 338: impatiently. "This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to
LINE 339: us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will
LINE 340: have control of things."
LINE 341: "We've got to beat them down," whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
LINE 342: toward the fervent sun.
LINE 343: "You ought to live in California—" began Miss Baker, but Tom
LINE 344: interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
LINE 345: "This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,
LINE 346: and—" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
LINE 347: slight nod, and she winked at me again. "—And we've produced all the
LINE 348: things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all
LINE 349: that. Do you see?"
LINE 350: There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his
LINE 351: complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.
LINE 352: When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler
LINE 353: left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned
LINE 354: towards me.
LINE 355: "I'll tell you a family secret," she whispered enthusiastically.
LINE 356: "It's about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's
LINE 357: nose?"
LINE 358: "That's why I came over tonight."
LINE 359: "Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher
LINE 360: for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred
LINE 361: people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it
LINE 362: began to affect his nose—"
LINE 363: "Things went from bad to worse," suggested Miss Baker.
LINE 364: "Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up
LINE 365: his position."
LINE 366: For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
LINE 367: glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I
LINE 368: listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering
LINE 369: regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
LINE 370: The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear,
LINE 371: whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went
LINE 372: inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned
LINE 373: forward again, her voice glowing and singing.
LINE 374: "I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an
LINE 375: absolute rose. Doesn't he?" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:
LINE 376: "An absolute rose?"
LINE 377: This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only
LINE 378: extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart
LINE 379: was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,
LINE 380: thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and
LINE 381: excused herself and went into the house.
LINE 382: Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of
LINE 383: meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said "Sh!"
LINE 384: in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the
LINE 385: room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to
LINE 386: hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,
LINE 387: mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.
LINE 388: "This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—" I began.
LINE 389: "Don't talk. I want to hear what happens."
LINE 390: "Is something happening?" I inquired innocently.
LINE 391: "You mean to say you don't know?" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.
LINE 392: "I thought everybody knew."
LINE 393: "I don't."
LINE 394: "Why—" she said hesitantly. "Tom's got some woman in New York."
LINE 395: "Got some woman?" I repeated blankly.
LINE 396: Miss Baker nodded.
LINE 397: "She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.
LINE 398: Don't you think?"
LINE 399: Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a
LINE 400: dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at
LINE 401: the table.
LINE 402: "It couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy with tense gaiety.
LINE 403: She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and
LINE 404: continued: "I looked outdoors for a minute, and it's very romantic
LINE 405: outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a
LINE 406: nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing
LINE 407: away—" Her voice sang: "It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"
LINE 408: "Very romantic," he said, and then miserably to me: "If it's light
LINE 409: enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables."
LINE 410: The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head
LINE 411: decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,
LINE 412: vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes
LINE 413: at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I
LINE 414: was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to
LINE 415: avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but
LINE 416: I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain
LINE 417: hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill
LINE 418: metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation
LINE 419: might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone
LINE 420: immediately for the police.
LINE 421: The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss
LINE 422: Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into
LINE 423: the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,
LINE 424: trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed
LINE 425: Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In
LINE 426: its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.
LINE 427: Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and
LINE 428: her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that
LINE 429: turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be
LINE 430: some sedative questions about her little girl.
LINE 431: "We don't know each other very well, Nick," she said suddenly. "Even
LINE 432: if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."
LINE 433: "I wasn't back from the war."
LINE 434: "That's true." She hesitated. "Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,
LINE 435: and I'm pretty cynical about everything."
LINE 436: Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,
LINE 437: and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her
LINE 438: daughter.
LINE 439: "I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything."
LINE 440: "Oh, yes." She looked at me absently. "Listen, Nick; let me tell you
LINE 441: what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?"
LINE 442: "Very much."
LINE 443: "It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was
LINE 444: less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of
LINE 445: the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right
LINE 446: away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I
LINE 447: turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a
LINE 448: girl. And I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be
LINE 449: in this world, a beautiful little fool.'
LINE 450: "You see I think everything's terrible anyhow," she went on in a
LINE 451: convinced way. "Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I
LINE 452: know. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything."
LINE 453: Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and
LINE 454: she laughed with thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated—God, I'm
LINE 455: sophisticated!"
LINE 456: The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my
LINE 457: belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me
LINE 458: uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to
LINE 459: exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a
LINE 460: moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as
LINE 461: if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret
LINE 462: society to which she and Tom belonged.
LINE 463: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 464: Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at
LINE 465: either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the
LINE 466: Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running
LINE 467: together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and
LINE 468: dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as
LINE 469: she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.
LINE 470: When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.
LINE 471: "To be continued," she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in
LINE 472: our very next issue."
LINE 473: Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she
LINE 474: stood up.
LINE 475: "Ten o'clock," she remarked, apparently finding the time on the
LINE 476: ceiling. "Time for this good girl to go to bed."
LINE 477: "Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow," explained Daisy,
LINE 478: "over at Westchester."
LINE 479: "Oh—you're Jordan Baker."
LINE 480: I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous
LINE 481: expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the
LINE 482: sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard
LINE 483: some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I
LINE 484: had forgotten long ago.
LINE 485: "Good night," she said softly. "Wake me at eight, won't you."
LINE 486: "If you'll get up."
LINE 487: "I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon."
LINE 488: "Of course you will," confirmed Daisy. "In fact I think I'll arrange a
LINE 489: marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of—oh—fling you
LINE 490: together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push
LINE 491: you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—"
LINE 492: "Good night," called Miss Baker from the stairs. "I haven't heard a
LINE 493: word."
LINE 494: "She's a nice girl," said Tom after a moment. "They oughtn't to let
LINE 495: her run around the country this way."
LINE 496: "Who oughtn't to?" inquired Daisy coldly.
LINE 497: "Her family."
LINE 498: "Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's
LINE 499: going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots
LINE 500: of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be
LINE 501: very good for her."
LINE 502: Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.
LINE 503: "Is she from New York?" I asked quickly.
LINE 504: "From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our
LINE 505: beautiful white—"
LINE 506: "Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?"
LINE 507: demanded Tom suddenly.
LINE 508: "Did I?" She looked at me. "I can't seem to remember, but I think we
LINE 509: talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept
LINE 510: up on us and first thing you know—"
LINE 511: "Don't believe everything you hear, Nick," he advised me.
LINE 512: I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes
LINE 513: later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood
LINE 514: side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor
LINE 515: Daisy peremptorily called: "Wait!
LINE 516: "I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were
LINE 517: engaged to a girl out West."
LINE 518: "That's right," corroborated Tom kindly. "We heard that you were
LINE 519: engaged."
LINE 520: "It's a libel. I'm too poor."
LINE 521: "But we heard it," insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again
LINE 522: in a flower-like way. "We heard it from three people, so it must be
LINE 523: true."
LINE 524: Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even
LINE 525: vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one
LINE 526: of the reasons I had come East. You can't stop going with an old
LINE 527: friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention
LINE 528: of being rumoured into marriage.
LINE 529: Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
LINE 530: rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove
LINE 531: away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out
LINE 532: of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such
LINE 533: intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he "had some woman
LINE 534: in New York" was really less surprising than that he had been
LINE 535: depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of
LINE 536: stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his
LINE 537: peremptory heart.
LINE 538: Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside
LINE 539: garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and
LINE 540: when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and
LINE 541: sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had
LINE 542: blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the
LINE 543: trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
LINE 544: blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered
LINE 545: across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I
LINE 546: was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of
LINE 547: my neighbour's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets
LINE 548: regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely
LINE 549: movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested
LINE 550: that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was
LINE 551: his of our local heavens.
LINE 552: I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and
LINE 553: that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him, for he
LINE 554: gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched
LINE 555: out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was
LINE 556: from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced
LINE 557: seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute
LINE 558: and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked
LINE 559: once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the
LINE 560: unquiet darkness.
