LINE 1: It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights
LINE 2: in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as
LINE 3: it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I
LINE 4: become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his
LINE 5: drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering
LINE 6: if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a
LINE 7: villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.
LINE 8: "Is Mr. Gatsby sick?"
LINE 9: "Nope." After a pause he added "sir" in a dilatory, grudging way.
LINE 10: "I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.
LINE 11: Carraway came over."
LINE 12: "Who?" he demanded rudely.
LINE 13: "Carraway."
LINE 14: "Carraway. All right, I'll tell him."
LINE 15: Abruptly he slammed the door.
LINE 16: My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his
LINE 17: house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never
LINE 18: went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered
LINE 19: moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that
LINE 20: the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the
LINE 21: village was that the new people weren't servants at all.
LINE 22: Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.
LINE 23: "Going away?" I inquired.
LINE 24: "No, old sport."
LINE 25: "I hear you fired all your servants."
LINE 26: "I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite
LINE 27: often—in the afternoons."
LINE 28: So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the
LINE 29: disapproval in her eyes.
LINE 30: "They're some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They're all
LINE 31: brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel."
LINE 32: "I see."
LINE 33: He was calling up at Daisy's request—would I come to lunch at her
LINE 34: house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy
LINE 35: herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was
LINE 36: coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would
LINE 37: choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing
LINE 38: scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.
LINE 39: The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of
LINE 40: the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only
LINE 41: the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering
LINE 42: hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of
LINE 43: combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into
LINE 44: her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her
LINE 45: fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her
LINE 46: pocketbook slapped to the floor.
LINE 47: "Oh, my!" she gasped.
LINE 48: I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it
LINE 49: at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that
LINE 50: I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,
LINE 51: suspected me just the same.
LINE 52: "Hot!" said the conductor to familiar faces. "Some weather! … Hot! …
LINE 53: Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?"
LINE 54: My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.
LINE 55: That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,
LINE 56: whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!
LINE 57: … Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind, carrying
LINE 58: the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at
LINE 59: the door.
LINE 60: "The master's body?" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. "I'm
LINE 61: sorry, madame, but we can't furnish it—it's far too hot to touch this
LINE 62: noon!"
LINE 63: What he really said was: "Yes … Yes … I'll see."
LINE 64: He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to
LINE 65: take our stiff straw hats.
LINE 66: "Madame expects you in the salon!" he cried, needlessly indicating the
LINE 67: direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the
LINE 68: common store of life.
LINE 69: The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
LINE 70: Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down
LINE 71: their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.
LINE 72: "We can't move," they said together.
LINE 73: Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment
LINE 74: in mine.
LINE 75: "And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?" I inquired.
LINE 76: Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall
LINE 77: telephone.
LINE 78: Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with
LINE 79: fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting
LINE 80: laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.
LINE 81: "The rumour is," whispered Jordan, "that that's Tom's girl on the
LINE 82: telephone."
LINE 83: We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: "Very
LINE 84: well, then, I won't sell you the car at all … I'm under no obligations
LINE 85: to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I
LINE 86: won't stand that at all!"
LINE 87: "Holding down the receiver," said Daisy cynically.
LINE 88: "No, he's not," I assured her. "It's a bona-fide deal. I happen to
LINE 89: know about it."
LINE 90: Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his
LINE 91: thick body, and hurried into the room.
LINE 92: "Mr. Gatsby!" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed
LINE 93: dislike. "I'm glad to see you, sir … Nick …"
LINE 94: "Make us a cold drink," cried Daisy.
LINE 95: As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and
LINE 96: pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.
LINE 97: "You know I love you," she murmured.
LINE 98: "You forget there's a lady present," said Jordan.
LINE 99: Daisy looked around doubtfully.
LINE 100: "You kiss Nick too."
LINE 101: "What a low, vulgar girl!"
LINE 102: "I don't care!" cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.
LINE 103: Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just
LINE 104: as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.
LINE 105: "Bles-sed pre-cious," she crooned, holding out her arms. "Come to your
LINE 106: own mother that loves you."
LINE 107: The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and
LINE 108: rooted shyly into her mother's dress.
LINE 109: "The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy
LINE 110: hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do."
LINE 111: Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.
LINE 112: Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he
LINE 113: had ever really believed in its existence before.
LINE 114: "I got dressed before luncheon," said the child, turning eagerly to
LINE 115: Daisy.
LINE 116: "That's because your mother wanted to show you off." Her face bent
LINE 117: into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. "You dream, you. You
LINE 118: absolute little dream."
LINE 119: "Yes," admitted the child calmly. "Aunt Jordan's got on a white dress
LINE 120: too."
LINE 121: "How do you like mother's friends?" Daisy turned her around so that
LINE 122: she faced Gatsby. "Do you think they're pretty?"
LINE 123: "Where's Daddy?"
LINE 124: "She doesn't look like her father," explained Daisy. "She looks like
LINE 125: me. She's got my hair and shape of the face."
LINE 126: Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held
LINE 127: out her hand.
LINE 128: "Come, Pammy."
LINE 129: "Goodbye, sweetheart!"
LINE 130: With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to
LINE 131: her nurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,
LINE 132: preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.
LINE 133: Gatsby took up his drink.
LINE 134: "They certainly look cool," he said, with visible tension.
LINE 135: We drank in long, greedy swallows.
LINE 136: "I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year," said Tom
LINE 137: genially. "It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into
LINE 138: the sun—or wait a minute—it's just the opposite—the sun's getting
LINE 139: colder every year.
LINE 140: "Come outside," he suggested to Gatsby, "I'd like you to have a look
LINE 141: at the place."
LINE 142: I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in
LINE 143: the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.
LINE 144: Gatsby's eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed
LINE 145: across the bay.
LINE 146: "I'm right across from you."
LINE 147: "So you are."
LINE 148: Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy
LINE 149: refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat
LINE 150: moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped
LINE 151: ocean and the abounding blessed isles.
LINE 152: "There's sport for you," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to be out there
LINE 153: with him for about an hour."
LINE 154: We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and
LINE 155: drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.
LINE 156: "What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon?" cried Daisy, "and the
LINE 157: day after that, and the next thirty years?"
LINE 158: "Don't be morbid," Jordan said. "Life starts all over again when it
LINE 159: gets crisp in the fall."
LINE 160: "But it's so hot," insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, "and
LINE 161: everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"
LINE 162: Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding
LINE 163: its senselessness into forms.
LINE 164: "I've heard of making a garage out of a stable," Tom was saying to
LINE 165: Gatsby, "but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a
LINE 166: garage."
LINE 167: "Who wants to go to town?" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes
LINE 168: floated toward her. "Ah," she cried, "you look so cool."
LINE 169: Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in
LINE 170: space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.
LINE 171: "You always look so cool," she repeated.
LINE 172: She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was
LINE 173: astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and
LINE 174: then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew
LINE 175: a long time ago.
LINE 176: "You resemble the advertisement of the man," she went on innocently.
LINE 177: "You know the advertisement of the man—"
LINE 178: "All right," broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to
LINE 179: town. Come on—we're all going to town."
LINE 180: He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one
LINE 181: moved.
LINE 182: "Come on!" His temper cracked a little. "What's the matter, anyhow?
LINE 183: If we're going to town, let's start."
LINE 184: His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips
LINE 185: the last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out
LINE 186: on to the blazing gravel drive.
LINE 187: "Are we just going to go?" she objected. "Like this? Aren't we going
LINE 188: to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?"
LINE 189: "Everybody smoked all through lunch."
LINE 190: "Oh, let's have fun," she begged him. "It's too hot to fuss."
LINE 191: He didn't answer.
LINE 192: "Have it your own way," she said. "Come on, Jordan."
LINE 193: They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there
LINE 194: shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon
LINE 195: hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed
LINE 196: his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.
LINE 197: "Have you got your stables here?" asked Gatsby with an effort.
LINE 198: "About a quarter of a mile down the road."
LINE 199: "Oh."
LINE 200: A pause.
LINE 201: "I don't see the idea of going to town," broke out Tom savagely.
LINE 202: "Women get these notions in their heads—"
LINE 203: "Shall we take anything to drink?" called Daisy from an upper window.
LINE 204: "I'll get some whisky," answered Tom. He went inside.
LINE 205: Gatsby turned to me rigidly:
LINE 206: "I can't say anything in his house, old sport."
LINE 207: "She's got an indiscreet voice," I remarked. "It's full of—" I
LINE 208: hesitated.
LINE 209: "Her voice is full of money," he said suddenly.
LINE 210: That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money—that
LINE 211: was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of
LINE 212: it, the cymbals' song of it … High in a white palace the king's
LINE 213: daughter, the golden girl …
LINE 214: Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed
LINE 215: by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and
LINE 216: carrying light capes over their arms.
LINE 217: "Shall we all go in my car?" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green
LINE 218: leather of the seat. "I ought to have left it in the shade."
LINE 219: "Is it standard shift?" demanded Tom.
LINE 220: "Yes."
LINE 221: "Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town."
LINE 222: The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.
LINE 223: "I don't think there's much gas," he objected.
LINE 224: "Plenty of gas," said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. "And
LINE 225: if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a
LINE 226: drugstore nowadays."
LINE 227: A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom
LINE 228: frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar
LINE 229: and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in
LINE 230: words, passed over Gatsby's face.
LINE 231: "Come on, Daisy," said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's
LINE 232: car. "I'll take you in this circus wagon."
LINE 233: He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.
LINE 234: "You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coupé."
LINE 235: She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan
LINE 236: and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the
LINE 237: unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive
LINE 238: heat, leaving them out of sight behind.
LINE 239: "Did you see that?" demanded Tom.
LINE 240: "See what?"
LINE 241: He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known
LINE 242: all along.
LINE 243: "You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?" he suggested. "Perhaps I am,
LINE 244: but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to
LINE 245: do. Maybe you don't believe that, but science—"
LINE 246: He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back
LINE 247: from the edge of theoretical abyss.
LINE 248: "I've made a small investigation of this fellow," he continued. "I
LINE 249: could have gone deeper if I'd known—"
LINE 250: "Do you mean you've been to a medium?" inquired Jordan humorously.
LINE 251: "What?" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. "A medium?"
LINE 252: "About Gatsby."
LINE 253: "About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small
LINE 254: investigation of his past."
LINE 255: "And you found he was an Oxford man," said Jordan helpfully.
LINE 256: "An Oxford man!" He was incredulous. "Like hell he is! He wears a pink
LINE 257: suit."
LINE 258: "Nevertheless he's an Oxford man."
LINE 259: "Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom contemptuously, "or something like
LINE 260: that."
LINE 261: "Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?"
LINE 262: demanded Jordan crossly.
LINE 263: "Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows
LINE 264: where!"
LINE 265: We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we
LINE 266: drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded
LINE 267: eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution
LINE 268: about gasoline.
LINE 269: "We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.
LINE 270: "But there's a garage right here," objected Jordan. "I don't want to
LINE 271: get stalled in this baking heat."
LINE 272: Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty
LINE 273: stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from
LINE 274: the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.
LINE 275: "Let's have some gas!" cried Tom roughly. "What do you think we
LINE 276: stopped for—to admire the view?"
LINE 277: "I'm sick," said Wilson without moving. "Been sick all day."
LINE 278: "What's the matter?"
LINE 279: "I'm all run down."
LINE 280: "Well, shall I help myself?" Tom demanded. "You sounded well enough on
LINE 281: the phone."
LINE 282: With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,
LINE 283: breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his
LINE 284: face was green.
LINE 285: "I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch," he said. "But I need money
LINE 286: pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your
LINE 287: old car."
LINE 288: "How do you like this one?" inquired Tom. "I bought it last week."
LINE 289: "It's a nice yellow one," said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.
LINE 290: "Like to buy it?"
LINE 291: "Big chance," Wilson smiled faintly. "No, but I could make some money
LINE 292: on the other."
LINE 293: "What do you want money for, all of a sudden?"
LINE 294: "I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go
LINE 295: West."
LINE 296: "Your wife does," exclaimed Tom, startled.
LINE 297: "She's been talking about it for ten years." He rested for a moment
LINE 298: against the pump, shading his eyes. "And now she's going whether she
LINE 299: wants to or not. I'm going to get her away."
LINE 300: The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a
LINE 301: waving hand.
LINE 302: "What do I owe you?" demanded Tom harshly.
LINE 303: "I just got wised up to something funny the last two days," remarked
LINE 304: Wilson. "That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering
LINE 305: you about the car."
LINE 306: "What do I owe you?"
LINE 307: "Dollar twenty."
LINE 308: The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a
LINE 309: bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn't
LINE 310: alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life
LINE 311: apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically
LINE 312: sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel
LINE 313: discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there
LINE 314: was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as
LINE 315: the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that
LINE 316: he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor
LINE 317: girl with child.
LINE 318: "I'll let you have that car," said Tom. "I'll send it over tomorrow
LINE 319: afternoon."
LINE 320: That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare
LINE 321: of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of
LINE 322: something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.
LINE 323: Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that
LINE 324: other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than
LINE 325: twenty feet away.
LINE 326: In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved
LINE 327: aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So
LINE 328: engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and
LINE 329: one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a
LINE 330: slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it
LINE 331: was an expression I had often seen on women's faces, but on Myrtle
LINE 332: Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized
LINE 333: that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on
LINE 334: Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.
LINE 335: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 336: There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we
LINE 337: drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his
LINE 338: mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping
LINE 339: precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the
LINE 340: accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving
LINE 341: Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an
LINE 342: hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in
LINE 343: sight of the easygoing blue coupé.
LINE 344: "Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool," suggested
LINE 345: Jordan. "I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away.
LINE 346: There's something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of
LINE 347: funny fruits were going to fall into your hands."
LINE 348: The word "sensuous" had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but
LINE 349: before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy
LINE 350: signalled us to draw up alongside.
LINE 351: "Where are we going?" she cried.
LINE 352: "How about the movies?"
LINE 353: "It's so hot," she complained. "You go. We'll ride around and meet you
LINE 354: after." With an effort her wit rose faintly. "We'll meet you on some
LINE 355: corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."
LINE 356: "We can't argue about it here," Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave
LINE 357: out a cursing whistle behind us. "You follow me to the south side of
LINE 358: Central Park, in front of the Plaza."
LINE 359: Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if
LINE 360: the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I
LINE 361: think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his
LINE 362: life forever.
LINE 363: But they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging
LINE 364: the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.
LINE 365: The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into
LINE 366: that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in
LINE 367: the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around
LINE 368: my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.
LINE 369: The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five
LINE 370: bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as
LINE 371: "a place to have a mint julep." Each of us said over and over that it
LINE 372: was a "crazy idea"—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and
LINE 373: thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …
LINE 374: The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four
LINE 375: o'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery
LINE 376: from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,
LINE 377: fixing her hair.
LINE 378: "It's a swell suite," whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone
LINE 379: laughed.
LINE 380: "Open another window," commanded Daisy, without turning around.
LINE 381: "There aren't any more."
LINE 382: "Well, we'd better telephone for an axe—"
LINE 383: "The thing to do is to forget about the heat," said Tom impatiently.
LINE 384: "You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it."
LINE 385: He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the
LINE 386: table.
LINE 387: "Why not let her alone, old sport?" remarked Gatsby. "You're the one
LINE 388: that wanted to come to town."
LINE 389: There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its
LINE 390: nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, "Excuse
LINE 391: me"—but this time no one laughed.
LINE 392: "I'll pick it up," I offered.
LINE 393: "I've got it." Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered "Hum!" in
LINE 394: an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.
LINE 395: "That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?" said Tom sharply.
LINE 396: "What is?"
LINE 397: "All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?"
LINE 398: "Now see here, Tom," said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, "if
LINE 399: you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute.
LINE 400: Call up and order some ice for the mint julep."
LINE 401: As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound
LINE 402: and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's
LINE 403: Wedding March from the ballroom below.
LINE 404: "Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!" cried Jordan dismally.
LINE 405: "Still—I was married in the middle of June," Daisy remembered.
LINE 406: "Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"
LINE 407: "Biloxi," he answered shortly.
LINE 408: "A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes—that's a
LINE 409: fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee."
LINE 410: "They carried him into my house," appended Jordan, "because we lived
LINE 411: just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy
LINE 412: told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died." After
LINE 413: a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, "There
LINE 414: wasn't any connection."
LINE 415: "I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.
LINE 416: "That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he
LINE 417: left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today."
LINE 418: The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer
LINE 419: floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of
LINE 420: "Yea—ea—ea!" and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.
LINE 421: "We're getting old," said Daisy. "If we were young we'd rise and
LINE 422: dance."
LINE 423: "Remember Biloxi," Jordan warned her. "Where'd you know him, Tom?"
LINE 424: "Biloxi?" He concentrated with an effort. "I didn't know him. He was a
LINE 425: friend of Daisy's."
LINE 426: "He was not," she denied. "I'd never seen him before. He came down in
LINE 427: the private car."
LINE 428: "Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa
LINE 429: Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room
LINE 430: for him."
LINE 431: Jordan smiled.
LINE 432: "He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of
LINE 433: your class at Yale."
LINE 434: Tom and I looked at each other blankly.
LINE 435: "Biloxi?"
LINE 436: "First place, we didn't have any president—"
LINE 437: Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.
LINE 438: "By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man."
LINE 439: "Not exactly."
LINE 440: "Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford."
LINE 441: "Yes—I went there."
LINE 442: A pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:
LINE 443: "You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven."
LINE 444: Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice
LINE 445: but the silence was unbroken by his "thank you" and the soft closing
LINE 446: of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.
LINE 447: "I told you I went there," said Gatsby.
LINE 448: "I heard you, but I'd like to know when."
LINE 449: "It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I
LINE 450: can't really call myself an Oxford man."
LINE 451: Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all
LINE 452: looking at Gatsby.
LINE 453: "It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the
LINE 454: armistice," he continued. "We could go to any of the universities in
LINE 455: England or France."
LINE 456: I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those
LINE 457: renewals of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.
LINE 458: Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.
LINE 459: "Open the whisky, Tom," she ordered, "and I'll make you a mint julep.
LINE 460: Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!"
LINE 461: "Wait a minute," snapped Tom, "I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more
LINE 462: question."
LINE 463: "Go on," Gatsby said politely.
LINE 464: "What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?"
LINE 465: They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.
LINE 466: "He isn't causing a row," Daisy looked desperately from one to the
LINE 467: other. "You're causing a row. Please have a little self-control."
LINE 468: "Self-control!" repeated Tom incredulously. "I suppose the latest
LINE 469: thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your
LINE 470: wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people
LINE 471: begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next
LINE 472: they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between
LINE 473: black and white."
LINE 474: Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone
LINE 475: on the last barrier of civilization.
LINE 476: "We're all white here," murmured Jordan.
LINE 477: "I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose
LINE 478: you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any
LINE 479: friends—in the modern world."
LINE 480: Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he
LINE 481: opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so
LINE 482: complete.
LINE 483: "I've got something to tell you, old sport—" began Gatsby. But Daisy
LINE 484: guessed at his intention.
LINE 485: "Please don't!" she interrupted helplessly. "Please let's all go
LINE 486: home. Why don't we all go home?"
LINE 487: "That's a good idea," I got up. "Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink."
LINE 488: "I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me."
LINE 489: "Your wife doesn't love you," said Gatsby. "She's never loved you.
LINE 490: She loves me."
LINE 491: "You must be crazy!" exclaimed Tom automatically.
LINE 492: Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.
LINE 493: "She never loved you, do you hear?" he cried. "She only married you
LINE 494: because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a
LINE 495: terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!"
LINE 496: At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted
LINE 497: with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had
LINE 498: anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously
LINE 499: of their emotions.
LINE 500: "Sit down, Daisy," Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal
LINE 501: note. "What's been going on? I want to hear all about it."
LINE 502: "I told you what's been going on," said Gatsby. "Going on for five
LINE 503: years—and you didn't know."
LINE 504: Tom turned to Daisy sharply.
LINE 505: "You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"
LINE 506: "Not seeing," said Gatsby. "No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved
LINE 507: each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to
LINE 508: laugh sometimes"—but there was no laughter in his eyes—"to think that
LINE 509: you didn't know."
LINE 510: "Oh—that's all." Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a
LINE 511: clergyman and leaned back in his chair.
LINE 512: "You're crazy!" he exploded. "I can't speak about what happened five
LINE 513: years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then—and I'll be damned if I
LINE 514: see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries
LINE 515: to the back door. But all the rest of that's a God damned lie. Daisy
LINE 516: loved me when she married me and she loves me now."
LINE 517: "No," said Gatsby, shaking his head.
LINE 518: "She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish
LINE 519: ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing." He nodded
LINE 520: sagely. "And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off
LINE 521: on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in
LINE 522: my heart I love her all the time."
LINE 523: "You're revolting," said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,
LINE 524: dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: "Do
LINE 525: you know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you
LINE 526: to the story of that little spree."
LINE 527: Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.
LINE 528: "Daisy, that's all over now," he said earnestly. "It doesn't matter
LINE 529: any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it's
LINE 530: all wiped out forever."
LINE 531: She looked at him blindly. "Why—how could I love him—possibly?"
LINE 532: "You never loved him."
LINE 533: She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,
LINE 534: as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she
LINE 535: had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done
LINE 536: now. It was too late.
LINE 537: "I never loved him," she said, with perceptible reluctance.
LINE 538: "Not at Kapiolani?" demanded Tom suddenly.
LINE 539: "No."
LINE 540: From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were
LINE 541: drifting up on hot waves of air.
LINE 542: "Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your
LINE 543: shoes dry?" There was a husky tenderness in his tone … "Daisy?"
LINE 544: "Please don't." Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.
LINE 545: She looked at Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said—but her hand as she tried
LINE 546: to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette
LINE 547: and the burning match on the carpet.
LINE 548: "Oh, you want too much!" she cried to Gatsby. "I love you now—isn't
LINE 549: that enough? I can't help what's past." She began to sob
LINE 550: helplessly. "I did love him once—but I loved you too."
LINE 551: Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.
LINE 552: "You loved me too?" he repeated.
LINE 553: "Even that's a lie," said Tom savagely. "She didn't know you were
LINE 554: alive. Why—there's things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,
LINE 555: things that neither of us can ever forget."
LINE 556: The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.
LINE 557: "I want to speak to Daisy alone," he insisted. "She's all excited
LINE 558: now—"
LINE 559: "Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom," she admitted in a pitiful
LINE 560: voice. "It wouldn't be true."
LINE 561: "Of course it wouldn't," agreed Tom.
LINE 562: She turned to her husband.
LINE 563: "As if it mattered to you," she said.
LINE 564: "Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now
LINE 565: on."
LINE 566: "You don't understand," said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. "You're
LINE 567: not going to take care of her any more."
LINE 568: "I'm not?" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to
LINE 569: control himself now. "Why's that?"
LINE 570: "Daisy's leaving you."
LINE 571: "Nonsense."
LINE 572: "I am, though," she said with a visible effort.
LINE 573: "She's not leaving me!" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.
LINE 574: "Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he
LINE 575: put on her finger."
LINE 576: "I won't stand this!" cried Daisy. "Oh, please let's get out."
LINE 577: "Who are you, anyhow?" broke out Tom. "You're one of that bunch that
LINE 578: hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I've
LINE 579: made a little investigation into your affairs—and I'll carry it
LINE 580: further tomorrow."
LINE 581: "You can suit yourself about that, old sport," said Gatsby steadily.
LINE 582: "I found out what your 'drugstores' were." He turned to us and spoke
LINE 583: rapidly. "He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street
LINE 584: drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the
LINE 585: counter. That's one of his little stunts. I picked him for a
LINE 586: bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn't far wrong."
LINE 587: "What about it?" said Gatsby politely. "I guess your friend Walter
LINE 588: Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it."
LINE 589: "And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for
LINE 590: a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the
LINE 591: subject of you."
LINE 592: "He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old
LINE 593: sport."
LINE 594: "Don't you call me 'old sport'!" cried Tom. Gatsby said
LINE 595: nothing. "Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but
LINE 596: Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth."
LINE 597: That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.
LINE 598: "That drugstore business was just small change," continued Tom slowly,
LINE 599: "but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me
LINE 600: about."
LINE 601: I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her
LINE 602: husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but
LINE 603: absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to
LINE 604: Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said
LINE 605: in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had
LINE 606: "killed a man." For a moment the set of his face could be described in
LINE 607: just that fantastic way.
LINE 608: It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying
LINE 609: everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been
LINE 610: made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into
LINE 611: herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the
LINE 612: afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,
LINE 613: struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across
LINE 614: the room.
LINE 615: The voice begged again to go.
LINE 616: "Please, Tom! I can't stand this any more."
LINE 617: Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage
LINE 618: she had had, were definitely gone.
LINE 619: "You two start on home, Daisy," said Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby's car."
LINE 620: She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous
LINE 621: scorn.
LINE 622: "Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous
LINE 623: little flirtation is over."
LINE 624: They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,
LINE 625: isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.
LINE 626: After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of
LINE 627: whisky in the towel.
LINE 628: "Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?"
LINE 629: I didn't answer.
LINE 630: "Nick?" He asked again.
LINE 631: "What?"
LINE 632: "Want any?"
LINE 633: "No … I just remembered that today's my birthday."
LINE 634: I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a
LINE 635: new decade.
LINE 636: It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupé with him and started
LINE 637: for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but
LINE 638: his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on
LINE 639: the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy
LINE 640: has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments
LINE 641: fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of
LINE 642: loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning
LINE 643: briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside
LINE 644: me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten
LINE 645: dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face
LINE 646: fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of
LINE 647: thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.
LINE 648: So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
LINE 649: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 650: The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the
LINE 651: ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept
LINE 652: through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the
LINE 653: garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale
LINE 654: as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go
LINE 655: to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if
LINE 656: he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent
LINE 657: racket broke out overhead.
LINE 658: "I've got my wife locked in up there," explained Wilson calmly.
LINE 659: "She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we're
LINE 660: going to move away."
LINE 661: Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and
LINE 662: Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.
LINE 663: Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working, he
LINE 664: sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars
LINE 665: that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably
LINE 666: laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife's man and not
LINE 667: his own.
LINE 668: So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson
LINE 669: wouldn't say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious
LINE 670: glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain
LINE 671: times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some
LINE 672: workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis
LINE 673: took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he
LINE 674: didn't. He supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside
LINE 675: again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation
LINE 676: because he heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in
LINE 677: the garage.
LINE 678: "Beat me!" he heard her cry. "Throw me down and beat me, you dirty
LINE 679: little coward!"
LINE 680: A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and
LINE 681: shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.
LINE 682: The "death car" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out
LINE 683: of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then
LINE 684: disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn't even sure of
LINE 685: its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The
LINE 686: other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards
LINE 687: beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
LINE 688: violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark
LINE 689: blood with the dust.
LINE 690: Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open
LINE 691: her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left
LINE 692: breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen
LINE 693: for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at
LINE 694: the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the
LINE 695: tremendous vitality she had stored so long.
LINE 696: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 697: We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still
LINE 698: some distance away.
LINE 699: "Wreck!" said Tom. "That's good. Wilson'll have a little business at
LINE 700: last."
LINE 701: He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as
LINE 702: we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage
LINE 703: door made him automatically put on the brakes.
LINE 704: "We'll take a look," he said doubtfully, "just a look."
LINE 705: I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly
LINE 706: from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked
LINE 707: toward the door resolved itself into the words "Oh, my God!" uttered
LINE 708: over and over in a gasping moan.
LINE 709: "There's some bad trouble here," said Tom excitedly.
LINE 710: He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the
LINE 711: garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal
LINE 712: basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a
LINE 713: violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way
LINE 714: through.
LINE 715: The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it
LINE 716: was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals
LINE 717: deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.
LINE 718: Myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another
LINE 719: blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on
LINE 720: a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending
LINE 721: over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking
LINE 722: down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I
LINE 723: couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed
LINE 724: clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the
LINE 725: raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to
LINE 726: the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low
LINE 727: voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his
LINE 728: shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly
LINE 729: from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk
LINE 730: back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,
LINE 731: horrible call:
LINE 732: "Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!"
LINE 733: Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around
LINE 734: the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to
LINE 735: the policeman.
LINE 736: "M-a-v—" the policeman was saying, "—o—"
LINE 737: "No, r—" corrected the man, "M-a-v-r-o—"
LINE 738: "Listen to me!" muttered Tom fiercely.
LINE 739: "r—" said the policeman, "o—"
LINE 740: "g—"
LINE 741: "g—" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.
LINE 742: "What you want, fella?"
LINE 743: "What happened?—that's what I want to know."
LINE 744: "Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."
LINE 745: "Instantly killed," repeated Tom, staring.
LINE 746: "She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car."
LINE 747: "There was two cars," said Michaelis, "one comin', one goin', see?"
LINE 748: "Going where?" asked the policeman keenly.
LINE 749: "One goin' each way. Well, she"—his hand rose toward the blankets but
LINE 750: stopped halfway and fell to his side—"she ran out there an' the one
LINE 751: comin' from N'York knock right into her, goin' thirty or forty miles
LINE 752: an hour."
LINE 753: "What's the name of this place here?" demanded the officer.
LINE 754: "Hasn't got any name."
LINE 755: A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.
LINE 756: "It was a yellow car," he said, "big yellow car. New."
LINE 757: "See the accident?" asked the policeman.
LINE 758: "No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going
LINE 759: fifty, sixty."
LINE 760: "Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his
LINE 761: name."
LINE 762: Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in
LINE 763: the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his
LINE 764: grasping cries:
LINE 765: "You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind
LINE 766: of car it was!"
LINE 767: Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten
LINE 768: under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in
LINE 769: front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.
LINE 770: "You've got to pull yourself together," he said with soothing
LINE 771: gruffness.
LINE 772: Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then
LINE 773: would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.
LINE 774: "Listen," said Tom, shaking him a little. "I just got here a minute
LINE 775: ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we've been talking
LINE 776: about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine—do you
LINE 777: hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon."
LINE 778: Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the
LINE 779: policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent
LINE 780: eyes.
LINE 781: "What's all that?" he demanded.
LINE 782: "I'm a friend of his." Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on
LINE 783: Wilson's body. "He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow
LINE 784: car."
LINE 785: Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.
LINE 786: "And what colour's your car?"
LINE 787: "It's a blue car, a coupé."
LINE 788: "We've come straight from New York," I said.
LINE 789: Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and
LINE 790: the policeman turned away.
LINE 791: "Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct—"
LINE 792: Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set
LINE 793: him down in a chair, and came back.
LINE 794: "If somebody'll come here and sit with him," he snapped
LINE 795: authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced
LINE 796: at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the
LINE 797: door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the
LINE 798: table. As he passed close to me he whispered: "Let's get out."
LINE 799: Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we
LINE 800: pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,
LINE 801: case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.
LINE 802: Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down
LINE 803: hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I
LINE 804: heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down
LINE 805: his face.
LINE 806: "The God damned coward!" he whimpered. "He didn't even stop his car."
LINE 807: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 808: The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark
LINE 809: rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the
LINE 810: second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.
LINE 811: "Daisy's home," he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and
LINE 812: frowned slightly.
LINE 813: "I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can
LINE 814: do tonight."
LINE 815: A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.
LINE 816: As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of
LINE 817: the situation in a few brisk phrases.
LINE 818: "I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting
LINE 819: you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some
LINE 820: supper—if you want any." He opened the door. "Come in."
LINE 821: "No, thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait
LINE 822: outside."
LINE 823: Jordan put her hand on my arm.
LINE 824: "Won't you come in, Nick?"
LINE 825: "No, thanks."
LINE 826: I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan
LINE 827: lingered for a moment more.
LINE 828: "It's only half-past nine," she said.
LINE 829: I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day,
LINE 830: and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of
LINE 831: this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the
LINE 832: porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head
LINE 833: in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's
LINE 834: voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from
LINE 835: the house, intending to wait by the gate.
LINE 836: I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped
LINE 837: from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird
LINE 838: by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity
LINE 839: of his pink suit under the moon.
LINE 840: "What are you doing?" I inquired.
LINE 841: "Just standing here, old sport."
LINE 842: Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was
LINE 843: going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to
LINE 844: see sinister faces, the faces of "Wolfshiem's people," behind him in
LINE 845: the dark shrubbery.
LINE 846: "Did you see any trouble on the road?" he asked after a minute.
LINE 847: "Yes."
LINE 848: He hesitated.
LINE 849: "Was she killed?"
LINE 850: "Yes."
LINE 851: "I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock
LINE 852: should all come at once. She stood it pretty well."
LINE 853: He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.
LINE 854: "I got to West Egg by a side road," he went on, "and left the car in
LINE 855: my garage. I don't think anybody saw us, but of course I can't be
LINE 856: sure."
LINE 857: I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to
LINE 858: tell him he was wrong.
LINE 859: "Who was the woman?" he inquired.
LINE 860: "Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did
LINE 861: it happen?"
LINE 862: "Well, I tried to swing the wheel—" He broke off, and suddenly I
LINE 863: guessed at the truth.
LINE 864: "Was Daisy driving?"
LINE 865: "Yes," he said after a moment, "but of course I'll say I was. You see,
LINE 866: when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would
LINE 867: steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were
LINE 868: passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but
LINE 869: it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were
LINE 870: somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward
LINE 871: the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second
LINE 872: my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her
LINE 873: instantly."
LINE 874: "It ripped her open—"
LINE 875: "Don't tell me, old sport." He winced. "Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I
LINE 876: tried to make her stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled on the emergency
LINE 877: brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.
LINE 878: "She'll be all right tomorrow," he said presently. "I'm just going to
LINE 879: wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness
LINE 880: this afternoon. She's locked herself into her room, and if he tries
LINE 881: any brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again."
LINE 882: "He won't touch her," I said. "He's not thinking about her."
LINE 883: "I don't trust him, old sport."
LINE 884: "How long are you going to wait?"
LINE 885: "All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed."
LINE 886: A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy
LINE 887: had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might
LINE 888: think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright
LINE 889: windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the ground
LINE 890: floor.
LINE 891: "You wait here," I said. "I'll see if there's any sign of a
LINE 892: commotion."
LINE 893: I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel
LINE 894: softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains
LINE 895: were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where
LINE 896: we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small
LINE 897: rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind
LINE 898: was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.
LINE 899: Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,
LINE 900: with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of
LINE 901: ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his
LINE 902: earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a
LINE 903: while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.
LINE 904: They weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the
LINE 905: ale—and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air
LINE 906: of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said
LINE 907: that they were conspiring together.
LINE 908: As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the
LINE 909: dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in
LINE 910: the drive.
LINE 911: "Is it all quiet up there?" he asked anxiously.
LINE 912: "Yes, it's all quiet." I hesitated. "You'd better come home and get
LINE 913: some sleep."
LINE 914: He shook his head.
LINE 915: "I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport."
LINE 916: He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his
LINE 917: scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of
LINE 918: the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the
LINE 919: moonlight—watching over nothing.
