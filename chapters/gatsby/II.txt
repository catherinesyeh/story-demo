LINE 1: About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily
LINE 2: joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as
LINE 3: to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley
LINE 4: of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and
LINE 5: hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and
LINE 6: chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of
LINE 7: ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery
LINE 8: air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,
LINE 9: gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the
LINE 10: ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable
LINE 11: cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.
LINE 12: But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
LINE 13: endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.
LINE 14: J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and
LINE 15: gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,
LINE 16: but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass
LINE 17: over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set
LINE 18: them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
LINE 19: sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved
LINE 20: away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun
LINE 21: and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
LINE 22: The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,
LINE 23: when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on
LINE 24: waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an
LINE 25: hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was
LINE 26: because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.
LINE 27: The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His
LINE 28: acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés
LINE 29: with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with
LINE 30: whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire
LINE 31: to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one
LINE 32: afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet
LINE 33: and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.
LINE 34: "We're getting off," he insisted. "I want you to meet my girl."
LINE 35: I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination
LINE 36: to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption
LINE 37: was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.
LINE 38: I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked
LINE 39: back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's
LINE 40: persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of
LINE 41: yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact
LINE 42: Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.
LINE 43: One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an
LINE 44: all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a
LINE 45: garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed
LINE 46: Tom inside.
LINE 47: The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
LINE 48: dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had
LINE 49: occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that
LINE 50: sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the
LINE 51: proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands
LINE 52: on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and
LINE 53: faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his
LINE 54: light blue eyes.
LINE 55: "Hello, Wilson, old man," said Tom, slapping him jovially on the
LINE 56: shoulder. "How's business?"
LINE 57: "I can't complain," answered Wilson unconvincingly. "When are you
LINE 58: going to sell me that car?"
LINE 59: "Next week; I've got my man working on it now."
LINE 60: "Works pretty slow, don't he?"
LINE 61: "No, he doesn't," said Tom coldly. "And if you feel that way about it,
LINE 62: maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all."
LINE 63: "I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly. "I just meant—"
LINE 64: His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.
LINE 65: Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish
LINE 66: figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was
LINE 67: in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh
LINE 68: sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark
LINE 69: blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there
LINE 70: was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of
LINE 71: her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking
LINE 72: through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,
LINE 73: looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without
LINE 74: turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:
LINE 75: "Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down."
LINE 76: "Oh, sure," agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little
LINE 77: office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A
LINE 78: white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled
LINE 79: everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.
LINE 80: "I want to see you," said Tom intently. "Get on the next train."
LINE 81: "All right."
LINE 82: "I'll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level."
LINE 83: She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with
LINE 84: two chairs from his office door.
LINE 85: We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days
LINE 86: before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was
LINE 87: setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.
LINE 88: "Terrible place, isn't it," said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor
LINE 89: Eckleburg.
LINE 90: "Awful."
LINE 91: "It does her good to get away."
LINE 92: "Doesn't her husband object?"
LINE 93: "Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so
LINE 94: dumb he doesn't know he's alive."
LINE 95: So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not
LINE 96: quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom
LINE 97: deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might
LINE 98: be on the train.
LINE 99: She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched
LINE 100: tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in
LINE 101: New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a
LINE 102: moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream
LINE 103: and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive
LINE 104: she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,
LINE 105: lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from
LINE 106: the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she
LINE 107: turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the
LINE 108: front glass.
LINE 109: "I want to get one of those dogs," she said earnestly. "I want to get
LINE 110: one for the apartment. They're nice to have—a dog."
LINE 111: We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John
LINE 112: D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very
LINE 113: recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.
LINE 114: "What kind are they?" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the
LINE 115: taxi-window.
LINE 116: "All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?"
LINE 117: "I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got
LINE 118: that kind?"
LINE 119: The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and
LINE 120: drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.
LINE 121: "That's no police dog," said Tom.
LINE 122: "No, it's not exactly a police dog," said the man with disappointment
LINE 123: in his voice. "It's more of an Airedale." He passed his hand over the
LINE 124: brown washrag of a back. "Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog
LINE 125: that'll never bother you with catching cold."
LINE 126: "I think it's cute," said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. "How much is
LINE 127: it?"
LINE 128: "That dog?" He looked at it admiringly. "That dog will cost you ten
LINE 129: dollars."
LINE 130: The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it
LINE 131: somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and
LINE 132: settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the
LINE 133: weatherproof coat with rapture.
LINE 134: "Is it a boy or a girl?" she asked delicately.
LINE 135: "That dog? That dog's a boy."
LINE 136: "It's a bitch," said Tom decisively. "Here's your money. Go and buy
LINE 137: ten more dogs with it."
LINE 138: We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the
LINE 139: summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great
LINE 140: flock of white sheep turn the corner.
LINE 141: "Hold on," I said, "I have to leave you here."
LINE 142: "No you don't," interposed Tom quickly. "Myrtle'll be hurt if you
LINE 143: don't come up to the apartment. Won't you, Myrtle?"
LINE 144: "Come on," she urged. "I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said
LINE 145: to be very beautiful by people who ought to know."
LINE 146: "Well, I'd like to, but—"
LINE 147: We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.
LINE 148: At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of
LINE 149: apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the
LINE 150: neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other
LINE 151: purchases, and went haughtily in.
LINE 152: "I'm going to have the McKees come up," she announced as we rose in
LINE 153: the elevator. "And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too."
LINE 154: The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small
LINE 155: dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded
LINE 156: to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for
LINE 157: it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of
LINE 158: ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an
LINE 159: over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.
LINE 160: Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a
LINE 161: bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the
LINE 162: room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with
LINE 163: a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines
LINE 164: of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant
LINE 165: elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he
LINE 166: added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of
LINE 167: which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all
LINE 168: afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked
LINE 169: bureau door.
LINE 170: I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that
LINE 171: afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,
LINE 172: although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful
LINE 173: sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the
LINE 174: telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some
LINE 175: at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both
LINE 176: disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a
LINE 177: chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the
LINE 178: whisky distorted things, because it didn't make any sense to me.
LINE 179: Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called
LINE 180: each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive
LINE 181: at the apartment door.
LINE 182: The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,
LINE 183: with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky
LINE 184: white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more
LINE 185: rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the
LINE 186: old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about
LINE 187: there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets
LINE 188: jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary
LINE 189: haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I
LINE 190: wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed
LINE 191: immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a
LINE 192: girl friend at a hotel.
LINE 193: Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just
LINE 194: shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he
LINE 195: was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He
LINE 196: informed me that he was in the "artistic game," and I gathered later
LINE 197: that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of
LINE 198: Mrs. Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His
LINE 199: wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with
LINE 200: pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven
LINE 201: times since they had been married.
LINE 202: Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now
LINE 203: attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,
LINE 204: which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With
LINE 205: the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a
LINE 206: change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage
LINE 207: was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her
LINE 208: assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she
LINE 209: expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be
LINE 210: revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.
LINE 211: "My dear," she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, "most of
LINE 212: these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I
LINE 213: had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me
LINE 214: the bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitis out."
LINE 215: "What was the name of the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee.
LINE 216: "Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own
LINE 217: homes."
LINE 218: "I like your dress," remarked Mrs. McKee, "I think it's adorable."
LINE 219: Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.
LINE 220: "It's just a crazy old thing," she said. "I just slip it on sometimes
LINE 221: when I don't care what I look like."
LINE 222: "But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean," pursued Mrs.
LINE 223: McKee. "If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could
LINE 224: make something of it."
LINE 225: We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair
LINE 226: from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.
LINE 227: McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved
LINE 228: his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.
LINE 229: "I should change the light," he said after a moment. "I'd like to
LINE 230: bring out the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of
LINE 231: all the back hair."
LINE 232: "I wouldn't think of changing the light," cried Mrs. McKee. "I think
LINE 233: it's—"
LINE 234: Her husband said "Sh!" and we all looked at the subject again,
LINE 235: whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.
LINE 236: "You McKees have something to drink," he said. "Get some more ice and
LINE 237: mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep."
LINE 238: "I told that boy about the ice." Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair
LINE 239: at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. "These people! You have to
LINE 240: keep after them all the time."
LINE 241: She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to
LINE 242: the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying
LINE 243: that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.
LINE 244: "I've done some nice things out on Long Island," asserted Mr. McKee.
LINE 245: Tom looked at him blankly.
LINE 246: "Two of them we have framed downstairs."
LINE 247: "Two what?" demanded Tom.
LINE 248: "Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the
LINE 249: other I call Montauk Point—The Sea."
LINE 250: The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.
LINE 251: "Do you live down on Long Island, too?" she inquired.
LINE 252: "I live at West Egg."
LINE 253: "Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named
LINE 254: Gatsby's. Do you know him?"
LINE 255: "I live next door to him."
LINE 256: "Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's
LINE 257: where all his money comes from."
LINE 258: "Really?"
LINE 259: She nodded.
LINE 260: "I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me."
LINE 261: This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.
LINE 262: McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:
LINE 263: "Chester, I think you could do something with her," she broke out, but
LINE 264: Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.
LINE 265: "I'd like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.
LINE 266: All I ask is that they should give me a start."
LINE 267: "Ask Myrtle," said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as
LINE 268: Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. "She'll give you a letter of
LINE 269: introduction, won't you, Myrtle?"
LINE 270: "Do what?" she asked, startled.
LINE 271: "You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can
LINE 272: do some studies of him." His lips moved silently for a moment as he
LINE 273: invented, " 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like
LINE 274: that."
LINE 275: Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:
LINE 276: "Neither of them can stand the person they're married to."
LINE 277: "Can't they?"
LINE 278: "Can't stand them." She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. "What I say
LINE 279: is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them
LINE 280: I'd get a divorce and get married to each other right away."
LINE 281: "Doesn't she like Wilson either?"
LINE 282: The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had
LINE 283: overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.
LINE 284: "You see," cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.
LINE 285: "It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic, and
LINE 286: they don't believe in divorce."
LINE 287: Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the
LINE 288: elaborateness of the lie.
LINE 289: "When they do get married," continued Catherine, "they're going West
LINE 290: to live for a while until it blows over."
LINE 291: "It'd be more discreet to go to Europe."
LINE 292: "Oh, do you like Europe?" she exclaimed surprisingly. "I just got back
LINE 293: from Monte Carlo."
LINE 294: "Really."
LINE 295: "Just last year. I went over there with another girl."
LINE 296: "Stay long?"
LINE 297: "No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of
LINE 298: Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we
LINE 299: got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an
LINE 300: awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!"
LINE 301: The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the
LINE 302: blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee
LINE 303: called me back into the room.
LINE 304: "I almost made a mistake, too," she declared vigorously. "I almost
LINE 305: married a little kike who'd been after me for years. I knew he was
LINE 306: below me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below
LINE 307: you!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."
LINE 308: "Yes, but listen," said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,
LINE 309: "at least you didn't marry him."
LINE 310: "I know I didn't."
LINE 311: "Well, I married him," said Myrtle, ambiguously. "And that's the
LINE 312: difference between your case and mine."
LINE 313: "Why did you, Myrtle?" demanded Catherine. "Nobody forced you to."
LINE 314: Myrtle considered.
LINE 315: "I married him because I thought he was a gentleman," she said
LINE 316: finally. "I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't
LINE 317: fit to lick my shoe."
LINE 318: "You were crazy about him for a while," said Catherine.
LINE 319: "Crazy about him!" cried Myrtle incredulously. "Who said I was crazy
LINE 320: about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that
LINE 321: man there."
LINE 322: She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I
LINE 323: tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.
LINE 324: "The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made
LINE 325: a mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in, and
LINE 326: never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he
LINE 327: was out: 'Oh, is that your suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever
LINE 328: heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to
LINE 329: beat the band all afternoon."
LINE 330: "She really ought to get away from him," resumed Catherine to me.
LINE 331: "They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the
LINE 332: first sweetie she ever had."
LINE 333: The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all
LINE 334: present, excepting Catherine, who "felt just as good on nothing at
LINE 335: all." Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated
LINE 336: sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to
LINE 337: get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,
LINE 338: but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident
LINE 339: argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet
LINE 340: high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed
LINE 341: their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening
LINE 342: streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and
LINE 343: without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible
LINE 344: variety of life.
LINE 345: Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath
LINE 346: poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.
LINE 347: "It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the
LINE 348: last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my
LINE 349: sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather
LINE 350: shoes, and I couldn't keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked
LINE 351: at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his
LINE 352: head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white
LINE 353: shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I'd have to call
LINE 354: a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into
LINE 355: a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway
LINE 356: train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live
LINE 357: forever; you can't live forever.' "
LINE 358: She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial
LINE 359: laughter.
LINE 360: "My dear," she cried, "I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm
LINE 361: through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to
LINE 362: make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave,
LINE 363: and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where
LINE 364: you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's
LINE 365: grave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't
LINE 366: forget all the things I got to do."
LINE 367: It was nine o'clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch
LINE 368: and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists
LINE 369: clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out
LINE 370: my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that
LINE 371: had worried me all the afternoon.
LINE 372: The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes
LINE 373: through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People
LINE 374: disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost
LINE 375: each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet
LINE 376: away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood
LINE 377: face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson
LINE 378: had any right to mention Daisy's name.
LINE 379: "Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!" shouted Mrs. Wilson. "I'll say it whenever I
LINE 380: want to! Daisy! Dai—"
LINE 381: Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his
LINE 382: open hand.
LINE 383: Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's
LINE 384: voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of
