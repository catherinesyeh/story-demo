LINE 1: There was music from my neighbour's house through the summer nights.
LINE 2: In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
LINE 3: whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the
LINE 4: afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or
LINE 5: taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats
LINE 6: slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of
LINE 7: foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties
LINE 8: to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past
LINE 9: midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to
LINE 10: meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra
LINE 11: gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers
LINE 12: and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
LINE 13: Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a
LINE 14: fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left
LINE 15: his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in
LINE 16: the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in
LINE 17: half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a
LINE 18: butler's thumb.
LINE 19: At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several
LINE 20: hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas
LINE 21: tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with
LINE 22: glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of
LINE 23: harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark
LINE 24: gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and
LINE 25: stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that
LINE 26: most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
LINE 27: By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,
LINE 28: but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and
LINE 29: cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have
LINE 30: come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from
LINE 31: New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and
LINE 32: salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in
LINE 33: strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is
LINE 34: in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden
LINE 35: outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual
LINE 36: innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic
LINE 37: meetings between women who never knew each other's names.
LINE 38: The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and
LINE 39: now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of
LINE 40: voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,
LINE 41: spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups
LINE 42: change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the
LINE 43: same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
LINE 44: here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
LINE 45: joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,
LINE 46: glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under
LINE 47: the constantly changing light.
LINE 48: Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail
LINE 49: out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like
LINE 50: Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the
LINE 51: orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a
LINE 52: burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda
LINE 53: Gray's understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.
LINE 54: I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one
LINE 55: of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not
LINE 56: invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out
LINE 57: to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there
LINE 58: they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they
LINE 59: conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated
LINE 60: with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having
LINE 61: met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that
LINE 62: was its own ticket of admission.
LINE 63: I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's-egg
LINE 64: blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly
LINE 65: formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby's,
LINE 66: it said, if I would attend his "little party" that night. He had seen
LINE 67: me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a
LINE 68: peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay
LINE 69: Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
LINE 70: Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after
LINE 71: seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies
LINE 72: of people I didn't know—though here and there was a face I had noticed
LINE 73: on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of
LINE 74: young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little
LINE 75: hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous
LINE 76: Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or
LINE 77: insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the
LINE 78: easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few
LINE 79: words in the right key.
LINE 80: As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or
LINE 81: three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an
LINE 82: amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,
LINE 83: that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place
LINE 84: in the garden where a single man could linger without looking
LINE 85: purposeless and alone.
LINE 86: I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when
LINE 87: Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble
LINE 88: steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous
LINE 89: interest down into the garden.
LINE 90: Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone
LINE 91: before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.
LINE 92: "Hello!" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally
LINE 93: loud across the garden.
LINE 94: "I thought you might be here," she responded absently as I came up.
LINE 95: "I remembered you lived next door to—"
LINE 96: She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me
LINE 97: in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who
LINE 98: stopped at the foot of the steps.
LINE 99: "Hello!" they cried together. "Sorry you didn't win."
LINE 100: That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week
LINE 101: before.
LINE 102: "You don't know who we are," said one of the girls in yellow, "but we
LINE 103: met you here about a month ago."
LINE 104: "You've dyed your hair since then," remarked Jordan, and I started,
LINE 105: but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to
LINE 106: the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a
LINE 107: caterer's basket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine, we
LINE 108: descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of
LINE 109: cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a
LINE 110: table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced
LINE 111: to us as Mr. Mumble.
LINE 112: "Do you come to these parties often?" inquired Jordan of the girl
LINE 113: beside her.
LINE 114: "The last one was the one I met you at," answered the girl, in an
LINE 115: alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: "Wasn't it for
LINE 116: you, Lucille?"
LINE 117: It was for Lucille, too.
LINE 118: "I like to come," Lucille said. "I never care what I do, so I always
LINE 119: have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and
LINE 120: he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from
LINE 121: Croirier's with a new evening gown in it."
LINE 122: "Did you keep it?" asked Jordan.
LINE 123: "Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the
LINE 124: bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two
LINE 125: hundred and sixty-five dollars."
LINE 126: "There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,"
LINE 127: said the other girl eagerly. "He doesn't want any trouble with
LINE 128: anybody."
LINE 129: "Who doesn't?" I inquired.
LINE 130: "Gatsby. Somebody told me—"
LINE 131: The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
LINE 132: "Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once."
LINE 133: A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and
LINE 134: listened eagerly.
LINE 135: "I don't think it's so much that," argued Lucille sceptically; "It's
LINE 136: more that he was a German spy during the war."
LINE 137: One of the men nodded in confirmation.
LINE 138: "I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in
LINE 139: Germany," he assured us positively.
LINE 140: "Oh, no," said the first girl, "it couldn't be that, because he was in
LINE 141: the American army during the war." As our credulity switched back to
LINE 142: her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. "You look at him sometimes
LINE 143: when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."
LINE 144: She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned
LINE 145: and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic
LINE 146: speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those
LINE 147: who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this
LINE 148: world.
LINE 149: The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now
LINE 150: being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were
LINE 151: spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were
LINE 152: three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate
LINE 153: given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that
LINE 154: sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
LINE 155: greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had
LINE 156: preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function
LINE 157: of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg
LINE 158: condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its
LINE 159: spectroscopic gaiety.
LINE 160: "Let's get out," whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and
LINE 161: inappropriate half-hour; "this is much too polite for me."
LINE 162: We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I
LINE 163: had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The
LINE 164: undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
LINE 165: The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not
LINE 166: there. She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't
LINE 167: on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and
LINE 168: walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,
LINE 169: and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.
LINE 170: A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was
LINE 171: sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with
LINE 172: unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he
LINE 173: wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.
LINE 174: "What do you think?" he demanded impetuously.
LINE 175: "About what?"
LINE 176: He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.
LINE 177: "About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I
LINE 178: ascertained. They're real."
LINE 179: "The books?"
LINE 180: He nodded.
LINE 181: "Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice
LINE 182: durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages
LINE 183: and—Here! Lemme show you."
LINE 184: Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and
LINE 185: returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.
LINE 186: "See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona-fide piece of printed
LINE 187: matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a
LINE 188: triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,
LINE 189: too—didn't cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?"
LINE 190: He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,
LINE 191: muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable
LINE 192: to collapse.
LINE 193: "Who brought you?" he demanded. "Or did you just come? I was brought.
LINE 194: Most people were brought."
LINE 195: Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.
LINE 196: "I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt," he continued. "Mrs. Claud
LINE 197: Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been
LINE 198: drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit
LINE 199: in a library."
LINE 200: "Has it?"
LINE 201: "A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here an hour.
LINE 202: Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're—"
LINE 203: "You told us."
LINE 204: We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
LINE 205: There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing
LINE 206: young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
LINE 207: holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the
LINE 208: corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or
LINE 209: relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
LINE 210: traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had
LINE 211: sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and
LINE 212: between the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden,
LINE 213: while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A
LINE 214: pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a
LINE 215: baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than
LINE 216: finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was
LINE 217: a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny
LINE 218: drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
LINE 219: I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man
LINE 220: of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the
LINE 221: slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying
LINE 222: myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene
LINE 223: had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and
LINE 224: profound.
LINE 225: At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
LINE 226: "Your face is familiar," he said politely. "Weren't you in the First
LINE 227: Division during the war?"
LINE 228: "Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry."
LINE 229: "I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen
LINE 230: you somewhere before."
LINE 231: We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.
LINE 232: Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just
LINE 233: bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.
LINE 234: "Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound."
LINE 235: "What time?"
LINE 236: "Any time that suits you best."
LINE 237: It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked
LINE 238: around and smiled.
LINE 239: "Having a gay time now?" she inquired.
LINE 240: "Much better." I turned again to my new acquaintance. "This is an
LINE 241: unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over
LINE 242: there—" I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, "and
LINE 243: this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation."
LINE 244: For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
LINE 245: "I'm Gatsby," he said suddenly.
LINE 246: "What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon."
LINE 247: "I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host."
LINE 248: He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one
LINE 249: of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that
LINE 250: you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to
LINE 251: face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on
LINE 252: you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you
LINE 253: just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you
LINE 254: would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had
LINE 255: precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to
LINE 256: convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an
LINE 257: elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate
LINE 258: formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he
LINE 259: introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his
LINE 260: words with care.
LINE 261: Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler
LINE 262: hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him
LINE 263: on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of
LINE 264: us in turn.
LINE 265: "If you want anything just ask for it, old sport," he urged me.
LINE 266: "Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."
LINE 267: When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure
LINE 268: her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid
LINE 269: and corpulent person in his middle years.
LINE 270: "Who is he?" I demanded. "Do you know?"
LINE 271: "He's just a man named Gatsby."
LINE 272: "Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?"
LINE 273: "Now you're started on the subject," she answered with a wan smile.
LINE 274: "Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man."
LINE 275: A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next
LINE 276: remark it faded away.
LINE 277: "However, I don't believe it."
LINE 278: "Why not?"
LINE 279: "I don't know," she insisted, "I just don't think he went there."
LINE 280: Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he
LINE 281: killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would
LINE 282: have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from
LINE 283: the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That
LINE 284: was comprehensible. But young men didn't—at least in my provincial
LINE 285: inexperience I believed they didn't—drift coolly out of nowhere and
LINE 286: buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
LINE 287: "Anyhow, he gives large parties," said Jordan, changing the subject
LINE 288: with an urban distaste for the concrete. "And I like large parties.
LINE 289: They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."
LINE 290: There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra
LINE 291: leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
LINE 292: "Ladies and gentlemen," he cried. "At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are
LINE 293: going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff's latest work, which
LINE 294: attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the
LINE 295: papers you know there was a big sensation." He smiled with jovial
LINE 296: condescension, and added: "Some sensation!" Whereupon everybody
LINE 297: laughed.
LINE 298: "The piece is known," he concluded lustily, "as 'Vladmir Tostoff's
LINE 299: Jazz History of the World!' "
LINE 300: The nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as it
LINE 301: began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and
LINE 302: looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin
LINE 303: was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as
LINE 304: though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
LINE 305: him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him
LINE 306: off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as
LINE 307: the fraternal hilarity increased. When the "Jazz History of the World"
LINE 308: was over, girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a
LINE 309: puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into
LINE 310: men's arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their
LINE 311: falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched
LINE 312: Gatsby's shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's
LINE 313: head for one link.
LINE 314: "I beg your pardon."
LINE 315: Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.
LINE 316: "Miss Baker?" he inquired. "I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would
LINE 317: like to speak to you alone."
LINE 318: "With me?" she exclaimed in surprise.
LINE 319: "Yes, madame."
LINE 320: She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and
LINE 321: followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her
LINE 322: evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a
LINE 323: jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk
LINE 324: upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
LINE 325: I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and
LINE 326: intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which
LINE 327: overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate, who was now
LINE 328: engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who
LINE 329: implored me to join him, I went inside.
LINE 330: The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was
LINE 331: playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady
LINE 332: from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of
LINE 333: champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,
LINE 334: that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was
LINE 335: weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with
LINE 336: gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering
LINE 337: soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for
LINE 338: when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they
LINE 339: assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow
LINE 340: black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes
LINE 341: on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and
LINE 342: went off into a deep vinous sleep.
LINE 343: "She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband," explained a
LINE 344: girl at my elbow.
LINE 345: I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights
LINE 346: with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet
LINE 347: from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was
LINE 348: talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after
LINE 349: attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent
LINE 350: way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals
LINE 351: she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:
LINE 352: "You promised!" into his ear.
LINE 353: The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall
LINE 354: was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly
LINE 355: indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in
LINE 356: slightly raised voices.
LINE 357: "Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home."
LINE 358: "Never heard anything so selfish in my life."
LINE 359: "We're always the first ones to leave."
LINE 360: "So are we."
LINE 361: "Well, we're almost the last tonight," said one of the men sheepishly.
LINE 362: "The orchestra left half an hour ago."
LINE 363: In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond
LINE 364: credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives
LINE 365: were lifted, kicking, into the night.
LINE 366: As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and
LINE 367: Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last
LINE 368: word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into
LINE 369: formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.
LINE 370: Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she
LINE 371: lingered for a moment to shake hands.
LINE 372: "I've just heard the most amazing thing," she whispered. "How long
LINE 373: were we in there?"
LINE 374: "Why, about an hour."
LINE 375: "It was … simply amazing," she repeated abstractedly. "But I swore I
LINE 376: wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you." She yawned gracefully
LINE 377: in my face. "Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of
LINE 378: Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …" She was hurrying off as she
LINE 379: talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
LINE 380: party at the door.
LINE 381: Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I
LINE 382: joined the last of Gatsby's guests, who were clustered around him. I
LINE 383: wanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to
LINE 384: apologize for not having known him in the garden.
LINE 385: "Don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Don't give it another
LINE 386: thought, old sport." The familiar expression held no more familiarity
LINE 387: than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. "And don't
LINE 388: forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine
LINE 389: o'clock."
LINE 390: Then the butler, behind his shoulder:
LINE 391: "Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir."
LINE 392: "All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there … Good night."
LINE 393: "Good night."
LINE 394: "Good night." He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant
LINE 395: significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired
LINE 396: it all the time. "Good night, old sport … Good night."
LINE 397: But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite
LINE 398: over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a
LINE 399: bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side
LINE 400: up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had
LINE 401: left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall
LINE 402: accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting
LINE 403: considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,
LINE 404: as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din
LINE 405: from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to
LINE 406: the already violent confusion of the scene.
LINE 407: A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in
LINE 408: the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the
LINE 409: tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
LINE 410: "See!" he explained. "It went in the ditch."
LINE 411: The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the
LINE 412: unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of
LINE 413: Gatsby's library.
LINE 414: "How'd it happen?"
LINE 415: He shrugged his shoulders.
LINE 416: "I know nothing whatever about mechanics," he said decisively.
LINE 417: "But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?"
LINE 418: "Don't ask me," said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole
LINE 419: matter. "I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It
LINE 420: happened, and that's all I know."
LINE 421: "Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night."
LINE 422: "But I wasn't even trying," he explained indignantly, "I wasn't even
LINE 423: trying."
LINE 424: An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
LINE 425: "Do you want to commit suicide?"
LINE 426: "You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!"
LINE 427: "You don't understand," explained the criminal. "I wasn't driving.
LINE 428: There's another man in the car."
LINE 429: The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained
LINE 430: "Ah-h-h!" as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was
LINE 431: now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened
LINE 432: wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a
LINE 433: pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively
LINE 434: at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
LINE 435: Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant
LINE 436: groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment
LINE 437: before he perceived the man in the duster.
LINE 438: "Wha's matter?" he inquired calmly. "Did we run outa gas?"
LINE 439: "Look!"
LINE 440: Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it
LINE 441: for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it
LINE 442: had dropped from the sky.
LINE 443: "It came off," someone explained.
LINE 444: He nodded.
LINE 445: "At first I din' notice we'd stopped."
LINE 446: A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,
LINE 447: he remarked in a determined voice:
LINE 448: "Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"
LINE 449: At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,
LINE 450: explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any
LINE 451: physical bond.
LINE 452: "Back out," he suggested after a moment. "Put her in reverse."
LINE 453: "But the wheel's off!"
LINE 454: He hesitated.
LINE 455: "No harm in trying," he said.
LINE 456: The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and
LINE 457: cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a
LINE 458: moon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before,
LINE 459: and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.
LINE 460: A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great
LINE 461: doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who
LINE 462: stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.
LINE 463: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINE 464: Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the
LINE 465: impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were
LINE 466: all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events
LINE 467: in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me
LINE 468: infinitely less than my personal affairs.
LINE 469: Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my
LINE 470: shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York
LINE 471: to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen
LINE 472: by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded
LINE 473: restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I
LINE 474: even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and
LINE 475: worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing
LINE 476: mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I
LINE 477: let it blow quietly away.
LINE 478: I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the
LINE 479: gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and
LINE 480: studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There
LINE 481: were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the
LINE 482: library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was
LINE 483: mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,
LINE 484: and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
LINE 485: I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,
LINE 486: and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and
LINE 487: machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue
LINE 488: and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few
LINE 489: minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever
LINE 490: know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their
LINE 491: apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and
LINE 492: smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm
LINE 493: darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting
LINE 494: loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who
LINE 495: loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary
LINE 496: restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant
LINE 497: moments of night and life.
LINE 498: Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined
LINE 499: five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I
LINE 500: felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they
LINE 501: waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,
LINE 502: and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining
LINE 503: that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate
LINE 504: excitement, I wished them well.
LINE 505: For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I
LINE 506: found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,
LINE 507: because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it
LINE 508: was something more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of
LINE 509: tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world
LINE 510: concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,
LINE 511: even though they don't in the beginning—and one day I found what it
LINE 512: was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a
LINE 513: borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about
LINE 514: it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me
LINE 515: that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a
LINE 516: row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved
LINE 517: her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached
LINE 518: the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his
LINE 519: statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been
LINE 520: mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
LINE 521: Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw
LINE 522: that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence
LINE 523: from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.
LINE 524: She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this
LINE 525: unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she
LINE 526: was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to
LINE 527: the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
LINE 528: It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you
LINE 529: never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on
LINE 530: that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving
LINE 531: a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our
LINE 532: fender flicked a button on one man's coat.
LINE 533: "You're a rotten driver," I protested. "Either you ought to be more
LINE 534: careful, or you oughtn't to drive at all."
LINE 535: "I am careful."
LINE 536: "No, you're not."
LINE 537: "Well, other people are," she said lightly.
LINE 538: "What's that got to do with it?"
LINE 539: "They'll keep out of my way," she insisted. "It takes two to make an
LINE 540: accident."
LINE 541: "Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."
LINE 542: "I hope I never will," she answered. "I hate careless people. That's
LINE 543: why I like you."
LINE 544: Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had
LINE 545: deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved
LINE 546: her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as
LINE 547: brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself
LINE 548: definitely out of that tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once
LINE 549: a week and signing them: "Love, Nick," and all I could think of was
LINE 550: how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of
LINE 551: perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague
LINE 552: understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
LINE 553: Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and
LINE 554: this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever
LINE 555: known.
