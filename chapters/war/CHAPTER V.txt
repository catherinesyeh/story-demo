LINE 1: "And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at
LINE 2: Milan?" asked Anna Pávlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of
LINE 3: Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
LINE 4: Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
LINE 5: the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is as
LINE 6: if the whole world had gone crazy."
LINE 7: Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a
LINE 8: sarcastic smile.
LINE 9: "'Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!'' * They say he was
LINE 10: very fine when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in
LINE 11: Italian: "'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!''
LINE 12: * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!
LINE 13: "I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
LINE 14: over," Anna Pávlovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to
LINE 15: endure this man who is a menace to everything."
LINE 16: "The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte, polite
LINE 17: but hopeless: "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis
LINE 18: XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he became
LINE 19: more animated. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their
LINE 20: betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending
LINE 21: ambassadors to compliment the usurper."
LINE 22: And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
LINE 23: Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
LINE 24: through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
LINE 25: little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé
LINE 26: coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity
LINE 27: as if she had asked him to do it.
LINE 28: "Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d'azur—maison Condé,"
LINE 29: said he.
LINE 30: The princess listened, smiling.
LINE 31: "If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the
LINE 32: vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
LINE 33: he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
LINE 34: follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone too
LINE 35: far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I
LINE 36: mean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and
LINE 37: then...."
LINE 38: He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
LINE 39: make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,
LINE 40: who had him under observation, interrupted:
LINE 41: "The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which
LINE 42: always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has
LINE 43: declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose
LINE 44: their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the
LINE 45: usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
LINE 46: of its rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
LINE 47: royalist emigrant.
LINE 48: "That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite
LINE 49: rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will
LINE 50: be difficult to return to the old regime."
LINE 51: "From what I have heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into
LINE 52: the conversation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
LINE 53: Bonaparte's side."
LINE 54: "It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte without
LINE 55: looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to know the
LINE 56: real state of French public opinion."
LINE 57: "Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
LINE 58: smile.
LINE 59: It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
LINE 60: remarks at him, though without looking at him.
LINE 61: "'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow
LINE 62: it,'" Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
LINE 63: Napoleon's words. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded
LINE 64: in.' I do not know how far he was justified in saying so."
LINE 65: "Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murder of the
LINE 66: duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
LINE 67: people," he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, "he ever was a hero,
LINE 68: after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
LINE 69: hero less on earth."
LINE 70: Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their
LINE 71: appreciation of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the
LINE 72: conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something
LINE 73: inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.
LINE 74: "The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre,
LINE 75: "was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon
LINE 76: showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
LINE 77: responsibility of that deed."
LINE 78: "Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.
LINE 79: "What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows
LINE 80: greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
LINE 81: work nearer to her.
LINE 82: "Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.
LINE 83: "Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his
LINE 84: knee with the palm of his hand.
LINE 85: The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his
LINE 86: audience over his spectacles and continued.
LINE 87: "I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled
LINE 88: from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone
LINE 89: understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
LINE 90: he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."
LINE 91: "Won't you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna
LINE 92: Pávlovna.
LINE 93: But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
LINE 94: "No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great
LINE 95: because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,
LINE 96: preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom
LINE 97: of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain
LINE 98: power."
LINE 99: "Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
LINE 100: commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
LINE 101: called him a great man," remarked the vicomte.
LINE 102: "He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might
LINE 103: rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
LINE 104: man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur Pierre,
LINE 105: betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme
LINE 106: youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.
LINE 107: "What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...
LINE 108: But won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pávlovna.
LINE 109: "Rousseau's Contrat Social," said the vicomte with a tolerant
LINE 110: smile.
LINE 111: "I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."
LINE 112: "Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected an
LINE 113: ironical voice.
LINE 114: "Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
LINE 115: important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
LINE 116: prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon
LINE 117: has retained in full force."
LINE 118: "Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at
LINE 119: last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
LINE 120: were, "high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does
LINE 121: not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and
LINE 122: equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the
LINE 123: contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."
LINE 124: Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
LINE 125: vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of
LINE 126: Pierre's outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was
LINE 127: horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words
LINE 128: had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
LINE 129: impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
LINE 130: a vigorous attack on the orator.
LINE 131: "But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the
LINE 132: fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is
LINE 133: innocent and untried?"
LINE 134: "I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains
LINE 135: the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not
LINE 136: at all like the conduct of a great man!"
LINE 137: "And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the
LINE 138: little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
LINE 139: "He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.
LINE 140: Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His
LINE 141: smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,
LINE 142: his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
LINE 143: another—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
LINE 144: ask forgiveness.
LINE 145: The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
LINE 146: this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were
LINE 147: silent.
LINE 148: "How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince
LINE 149: Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
LINE 150: between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
LINE 151: So it seems to me."
LINE 152: "Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
LINE 153: this reinforcement.
LINE 154: "One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man
LINE 155: was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
LINE 156: gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts
LINE 157: which it is difficult to justify."
LINE 158: Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
LINE 159: Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
LINE 160: go.
LINE 161: Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
LINE 162: and asking them all to be seated began:
LINE 163: "I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
LINE 164: Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be
LINE 165: lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
LINE 166: as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
LINE 167: Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
LINE 168: attention to his story.
LINE 169: "There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must
LINE 170: have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her
LINE 171: taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said...."
LINE 172: Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
LINE 173: difficulty.
LINE 174: "She said.... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a
LINE 175: livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some
LINE 176: calls.'"
LINE 177: Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
LINE 178: audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several
LINE 179: persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however
LINE 180: smile.
LINE 181: "She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and
LINE 182: her long hair came down...." Here he could contain himself no
LINE 183: longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: "And the whole world
LINE 184: knew...."
LINE 185: And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told
LINE 186: it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the
LINE 187: others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so agreeably
LINE 188: ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote
LINE 189: the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last
LINE 190: and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and
LINE 191: where.
