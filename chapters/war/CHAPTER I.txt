LINE 1: Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
LINE 2: Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
LINE 3: if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
LINE 4: Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing
LINE 5: more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my
LINE 6: 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I
LINE 7: have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news."
LINE 8: It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna
LINE 9: Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.
LINE 10: With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high
LINE 11: rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna
LINE 12: Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering
LINE 13: from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used
LINE 14: only by the elite.
LINE 15: All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered
LINE 16: by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:
LINE 17: "If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
LINE 18: prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
LINE 19: I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette
LINE 20: Schérer."
LINE 21: "Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the
LINE 22: least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
LINE 23: embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on
LINE 24: his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that
LINE 25: refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and
LINE 26: with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
LINE 27: who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,
LINE 28: kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
LINE 29: and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
LINE 30: "First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's
LINE 31: mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the
LINE 32: politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony
LINE 33: could be discerned.
LINE 34: "Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
LINE 35: like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pávlovna. "You are
LINE 36: staying the whole evening, I hope?"
LINE 37: "And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I
LINE 38: must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is
LINE 39: coming for me to take me there."
LINE 40: "I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these
LINE 41: festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."
LINE 42: "If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have
LINE 43: been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force
LINE 44: of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
LINE 45: "Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev's
LINE 46: dispatch? You know everything."
LINE 47: "What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold, listless
LINE 48: tone. "What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has
LINE 49: burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours."
LINE 50: Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
LINE 51: part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
LINE 52: overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had
LINE 53: become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not
LINE 54: feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
LINE 55: expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it
LINE 56: did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,
LINE 57: as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,
LINE 58: which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
LINE 59: correct.
LINE 60: In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst
LINE 61: out:
LINE 62: "Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand
LINE 63: things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She
LINE 64: is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign
LINE 65: recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one
LINE 66: thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
LINE 67: the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will
LINE 68: not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
LINE 69: revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
LINE 70: this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just
LINE 71: one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial
LINE 72: spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's
LINE 73: loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to
LINE 74: find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer
LINE 75: did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot
LINE 76: understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
LINE 77: himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they
LINE 78: promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not
LINE 79: perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
LINE 80: that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a
LINE 81: word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian
LINE 82: neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty
LINE 83: destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!"
LINE 84: She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
LINE 85: "I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been
LINE 86: sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King
LINE 87: of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me
LINE 88: a cup of tea?"
LINE 89: "In a moment. À propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am
LINE 90: expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who
LINE 91: is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
LINE 92: French families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And
LINE 93: also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been
LINE 94: received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"
LINE 95: "I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But
LINE 96: tell me," he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just
LINE 97: occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief
LINE 98: motive of his visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants
LINE 99: Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all
LINE 100: accounts is a poor creature."
LINE 101: Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
LINE 102: trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for
LINE 103: the baron.
LINE 104: Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
LINE 105: anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
LINE 106: pleased with.
LINE 107: "Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her
LINE 108: sister," was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
LINE 109: As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna's face suddenly assumed an
LINE 110: expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
LINE 111: sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
LINE 112: patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke
LINE 113: beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
LINE 114: The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
LINE 115: courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna
LINE 116: wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man
LINE 117: recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she
LINE 118: said:
LINE 119: "Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
LINE 120: out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
LINE 121: beautiful."
LINE 122: The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
LINE 123: "I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
LINE 124: to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
LINE 125: and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
LINE 126: conversation—"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
LINE 127: are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?
LINE 128: I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like him," she
LINE 129: added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
LINE 130: "Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than
LINE 131: anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them."
LINE 132: And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
LINE 133: "I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I
LINE 134: lack the bump of paternity."
LINE 135: "Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know
LINE 136: I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her
LINE 137: face assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her
LINE 138: Majesty's and you were pitied...."
LINE 139: The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
LINE 140: awaiting a reply. He frowned.
LINE 141: "What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all
LINE 142: a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
LINE 143: Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That
LINE 144: is the only difference between them." He said this smiling in a way
LINE 145: more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round
LINE 146: his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and
LINE 147: unpleasant.
LINE 148: "And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a
LINE 149: father there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna
LINE 150: Pávlovna, looking up pensively.
LINE 151: "I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
LINE 152: children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That
LINE 153: is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"
LINE 154: He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
LINE 155: gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.
LINE 156: "Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she
LINE 157: asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I
LINE 158: don't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who
LINE 159: is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess
LINE 160: Mary Bolkónskaya."
LINE 161: Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
LINE 162: perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of
LINE 163: the head that he was considering this information.
LINE 164: "Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
LINE 165: current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand
LINE 166: rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in
LINE 167: five years, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That's
LINE 168: what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours
LINE 169: rich?"
LINE 170: "Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is
LINE 171: the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under
LINE 172: the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is
LINE 173: very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.
LINE 174: She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.
LINE 175: He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov's and will be here tonight."
LINE 176: "Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna
LINE 177: Pávlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange
LINE 178: that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe
LINE 179: with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich
LINE 180: and of good family and that's all I want."
LINE 181: And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
LINE 182: maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro
LINE 183: as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
LINE 184: "Attendez," said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to
LINE 185: Lise, young Bolkónski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the
LINE 186: thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll
LINE 187: start my apprenticeship as old maid."
