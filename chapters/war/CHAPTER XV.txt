LINE 1: "My dear Borís," said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as
LINE 2: Countess Rostóva's carriage in which they were seated drove over the
LINE 3: straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
LINE 4: Vladímirovich Bezúkhov's house. "My dear Borís," said the
LINE 5: mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying
LINE 6: it timidly and tenderly on her son's arm, "be affectionate and
LINE 7: attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after
LINE 8: all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice
LINE 9: to him, as you so well know how to be."
LINE 10: "If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
LINE 11: it..." answered her son coldly. "But I have promised and will do it
LINE 12: for your sake."
LINE 13: Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the
LINE 14: entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
LINE 15: be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
LINE 16: rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old
LINE 17: cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,
LINE 18: hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse
LINE 19: today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
LINE 20: "We may as well go back," said the son in French.
LINE 21: "My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand
LINE 22: on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
LINE 23: Borís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
LINE 24: off his cloak.
LINE 25: "My friend," said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing
LINE 26: the hall porter, "I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill...
LINE 27: that's why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him,
LINE 28: my friend... I only need see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying
LINE 29: here, is he not? Please announce me."
LINE 30: The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
LINE 31: away.
LINE 32: "Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich," he called
LINE 33: to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,
LINE 34: who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
LINE 35: The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
LINE 36: Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly
LINE 37: ascended the carpeted stairs.
LINE 38: "My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a
LINE 39: touch, "you promised me!"
LINE 40: The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
LINE 41: They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
LINE 42: apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli.
LINE 43: Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were
LINE 44: about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
LINE 45: entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli
LINE 46: came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,
LINE 47: as was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-looking,
LINE 48: dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
LINE 49: "Then it is certain?" said the prince.
LINE 50: "Prince, humanum est errare, * but..." replied the doctor,
LINE 51: swallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French
LINE 52: accent.
LINE 53: * To err is human.
LINE 54: "Very well, very well..."
LINE 55: Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the
LINE 56: doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
LINE 57: inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly
LINE 58: clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.
LINE 59: "Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our
LINE 60: dear invalid?" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look
LINE 61: fixed on her.
LINE 62: Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed.
LINE 63: Borís bowed politely. Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow
LINE 64: turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the
LINE 65: head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.
LINE 66: "Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. "Oh, how awful!
LINE 67: It is terrible to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating
LINE 68: Borís. "He wanted to thank you himself."
LINE 69: Borís bowed again politely.
LINE 70: "Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you
LINE 71: have done for us."
LINE 72: "I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna
LINE 73: Mikháylovna," said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in
LINE 74: tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed
LINE 75: under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he
LINE 76: had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer's reception.
LINE 77: "Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing
LINE 78: Borís with severity. "I am glad.... Are you here on leave?" he went
LINE 79: on in his usual tone of indifference.
LINE 80: "I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,"
LINE 81: replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque
LINE 82: manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly
LINE 83: and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
LINE 84: "Are you living with your mother?"
LINE 85: "I am living at Countess Rostóva's," replied Borís, again
LINE 86: adding, "your excellency."
LINE 87: "That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná," said
LINE 88: Anna Mikháylovna.
LINE 89: "I know, I know," answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice.
LINE 90: "I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
LINE 91: unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,
LINE 92: I am told."
LINE 93: "But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikháylovna with a
LINE 94: pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this
LINE 95: censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. "What
LINE 96: do the doctors say?" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face
LINE 97: again expressing deep sorrow.
LINE 98: "They give little hope," replied the prince.
LINE 99: "And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me
LINE 100: and Borís. He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that
LINE 101: this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction.
LINE 102: Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna saw that
LINE 103: he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov's fortune,
LINE 104: and hastened to reassure him.
LINE 105: "If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,"
LINE 106: said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I
LINE 107: know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with
LINE 108: him except the young princesses.... They are still young...." She bent
LINE 109: her head and continued in a whisper: "Has he performed his final duty,
LINE 110: Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no
LINE 111: worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.
LINE 112: We women, Prince," and she smiled tenderly, "always know how to say
LINE 113: these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for
LINE 114: me. I am used to suffering."
LINE 115: Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done
LINE 116: at Anna Pávlovna's, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna
LINE 117: Mikháylovna.
LINE 118: "Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna
LINE 119: Mikháylovna?" said he. "Let us wait until evening. The doctors are
LINE 120: expecting a crisis."
LINE 121: "But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
LINE 122: welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
LINE 123: Christian..."
LINE 124: A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the
LINE 125: count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her
LINE 126: body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli
LINE 127: turned to her.
LINE 128: "Well, how is he?"
LINE 129: "Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise..." said the
LINE 130: princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.
LINE 131: "Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikháylovna with a
LINE 132: happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. "I have come,
LINE 133: and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you
LINE 134: have gone through," and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
LINE 135: The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as
LINE 136: Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she
LINE 137: had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to
LINE 138: take a seat beside her.
LINE 139: "Borís," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see
LINE 140: the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
LINE 141: and don't forget to give him the Rostóvs' invitation. They ask him
LINE 142: to dinner. I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the
LINE 143: prince.
LINE 144: "On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become
LINE 145: depressed, "I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
LINE 146: man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him."
LINE 147: He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one flight of
LINE 148: stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.
