LINE 1: After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave
LINE 2: orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
LINE 3: dinner all who came "to congratulate." The countess wished to have
LINE 4: a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
LINE 5: Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
LINE 6: Petersburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,
LINE 7: drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.
LINE 8: "With you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikháylovna. "There
LINE 9: are not many left of us old friends! That's why I so value your
LINE 10: friendship."
LINE 11: Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her
LINE 12: friend's hand.
LINE 13: "Véra," she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
LINE 14: favorite, "how is it you have so little tact? Don't you see you are
LINE 15: not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or..."
LINE 16: The handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.
LINE 17: "If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied
LINE 18: as she rose to go to her own room.
LINE 19: But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,
LINE 20: one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was
LINE 21: sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the
LINE 22: first he had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window
LINE 23: and ceased talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at
LINE 24: Véra with guilty, happy faces.
LINE 25: It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but
LINE 26: apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.
LINE 27: "How often have I asked you not to take my things?" she said. "You
LINE 28: have a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
LINE 29: "In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.
LINE 30: "You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued Véra.
LINE 31: "You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed
LINE 32: of you."
LINE 33: Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
LINE 34: replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the
LINE 35: room with the inkstand in her hand.
LINE 36: "And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and
LINE 37: Borís, or between you two? It's all nonsense!"
LINE 38: "Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?" said Natásha in defense,
LINE 39: speaking very gently.
LINE 40: She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
LINE 41: everyone.
LINE 42: "Very silly," said Véra. "I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!"
LINE 43: "All have secrets of their own," answered Natásha, getting warmer.
LINE 44: "We don't interfere with you and Berg."
LINE 45: "I should think not," said Véra, "because there can never be
LINE 46: anything wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are
LINE 47: behaving with Borís."
LINE 48: "Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me," remarked Borís. "I
LINE 49: have nothing to complain of."
LINE 50: "Don't, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really
LINE 51: tiresome," said Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
LINE 52: (She used the word "diplomat," which was just then much in vogue
LINE 53: among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) "Why
LINE 54: does she bother me?" And she added, turning to Véra, "You'll
LINE 55: never understand it, because you've never loved anyone. You have no
LINE 56: heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more" (this nickname,
LINE 57: bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), "and
LINE 58: your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with
LINE 59: Berg as much as you please," she finished quickly.
LINE 60: "I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors..."
LINE 61: "Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas—"said
LINE 62: unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let's go to the
LINE 63: nursery."
LINE 64: All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
LINE 65: "The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked Véra, "I said
LINE 66: none to anyone."
LINE 67: "Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!" shouted laughing voices
LINE 68: through the door.
LINE 69: The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
LINE 70: effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been
LINE 71: said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.
LINE 72: Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and
LINE 73: calmer.
LINE 74: In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
LINE 75: "Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses
LINE 76: either. Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't
LINE 77: last long? It's all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the
LINE 78: country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what
LINE 79: besides! But don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed
LINE 80: everything. I often wonder at you, Annette—how at your age you
LINE 81: can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those
LINE 82: ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It's
LINE 83: quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn't possibly
LINE 84: do it."
LINE 85: "Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikháylovna, "God grant you never
LINE 86: know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love
LINE 87: to distraction! One learns many things then," she added with a certain
LINE 88: pride. "That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those
LINE 89: big people I write a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an interview
LINE 90: with So and-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or
LINE 91: four times—till I get what I want. I don't mind what they think of
LINE 92: me."
LINE 93: "Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?" asked the countess.
LINE 94: "You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas
LINE 95: is going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for him. To
LINE 96: whom did you apply?"
LINE 97: "To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,
LINE 98: and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna
LINE 99: Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she
LINE 100: had endured to gain her end.
LINE 101: "Has Prince Vasíli aged much?" asked the countess. "I have not
LINE 102: seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs' theatricals. I
LINE 103: expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days," said
LINE 104: the countess, with a smile.
LINE 105: "He is just the same as ever," replied Anna Mikháylovna,
LINE 106: "overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head
LINE 107: at all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear
LINE 108: Princess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very
LINE 109: kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do
LINE 110: anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my
LINE 111: position is now a terrible one," continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly,
LINE 112: dropping her voice. "My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no
LINE 113: progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don't
LINE 114: know how to equip Borís." She took out her handkerchief and began to
LINE 115: cry. "I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble
LINE 116: note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril
LINE 117: Vladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson—you know
LINE 118: he is Bóry's godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance,
LINE 119: all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to
LINE 120: equip him."
LINE 121: The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
LINE 122: "I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," said the princess,
LINE 123: "that here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all
LINE 124: alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a
LINE 125: burden to him, and Bóry's life is only just beginning...."
LINE 126: "Surely he will leave something to Borís," said the countess.
LINE 127: "Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
LINE 128: Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak
LINE 129: to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's
LINE 130: really all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The
LINE 131: princess rose. "It's now two o'clock and you dine at four. There
LINE 132: will just be time."
LINE 133: And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
LINE 134: time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the
LINE 135: anteroom with him.
LINE 136: "Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the
LINE 137: door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me
LINE 138: good luck."
LINE 139: "Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?" said the
LINE 140: count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:
LINE 141: "If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the
LINE 142: house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my
LINE 143: dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count
LINE 144: Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!"
