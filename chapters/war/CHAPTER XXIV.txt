LINE 1: There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the
LINE 2: eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the
LINE 3: Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
LINE 4: they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
LINE 5: something as she whispered:
LINE 6: "I can't bear the sight of that woman."
LINE 7: "Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room," said Prince
LINE 8: Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. "Go and take something, my poor Anna
LINE 9: Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out."
LINE 10: To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
LINE 11: below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small
LINE 12: drawing room.
LINE 13: "There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
LINE 14: of this delicious Russian tea," Lorrain was saying with an air of
LINE 15: restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese
LINE 16: handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
LINE 17: in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count
LINE 18: Bezúkhov's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.
LINE 19: Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
LINE 20: and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not
LINE 21: know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies
LINE 22: who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and
LINE 23: pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly
LINE 24: lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now
LINE 25: this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea
LINE 26: things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the
LINE 27: night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly
LINE 28: whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none
LINE 29: of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the
LINE 30: bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have
LINE 31: liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was
LINE 32: again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince
LINE 33: Vasíli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was
LINE 34: essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna
LINE 35: was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited
LINE 36: whispers.
LINE 37: "Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
LINE 38: necessary," said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
LINE 39: same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
LINE 40: "But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but
LINE 41: impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
LINE 42: from passing, "won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment
LINE 43: when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is
LINE 44: already prepared..."
LINE 45: Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,
LINE 46: with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so
LINE 47: flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but
LINE 48: he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were
LINE 49: saying.
LINE 50: "Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You
LINE 51: know how fond the count is of her."
LINE 52: "I don't even know what is in this paper," said the younger of
LINE 53: the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid
LINE 54: portfolio she held in her hand. "All I know is that his real will is
LINE 55: in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten...."
LINE 56: She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar
LINE 57: her path.
LINE 58: "I know, my dear, kind princess," said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing
LINE 59: the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
LINE 60: "Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous
LINE 61: en conjure..."
LINE 62: The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the
LINE 63: portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if
LINE 64: the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna
LINE 65: Mikháylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none
LINE 66: of its honeyed firmness and softness.
LINE 67: "Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
LINE 68: family consultation; is it not so, Prince?"
LINE 69: "Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so
LINE 70: loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. "Why
LINE 71: do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
LINE 72: interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room?
LINE 73: Intriguer!" she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the
LINE 74: portfolio.
LINE 75: But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
LINE 76: portfolio, and changed her grip.
LINE 77: Prince Vasíli rose. "Oh!" said he with reproach and surprise,
LINE 78: "this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you."
LINE 79: The princess let go.
LINE 80: "And you too!"
LINE 81: But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.
LINE 82: "Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go
LINE 83: and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?"
LINE 84: "But, Prince," said Anna Mikháylovna, "after such a solemn
LINE 85: sacrament, allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your
LINE 86: opinion," said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite
LINE 87: close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess
LINE 88: which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince
LINE 89: Vasíli.
LINE 90: "Remember that you will answer for the consequences," said Prince
LINE 91: Vasíli severely. "You don't know what you are doing."
LINE 92: "Vile woman!" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
LINE 93: Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
LINE 94: Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.
LINE 95: At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long
LINE 96: and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged
LINE 97: against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out
LINE 98: wringing her hands.
LINE 99: "What are you doing!" she cried vehemently. "He is dying and you
LINE 100: leave me alone with him!"
LINE 101: Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly
LINE 102: caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest
LINE 103: princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few
LINE 104: minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
LINE 105: biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
LINE 106: irrepressible hatred.
LINE 107: "Yes, now you may be glad!" said she; "this is what you have
LINE 108: been waiting for." And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
LINE 109: handkerchief and rushed from the room.
LINE 110: Prince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
LINE 111: sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre
LINE 112: noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
LINE 113: ague.
LINE 114: "Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was
LINE 115: in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it
LINE 116: before. "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am
LINE 117: near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is
LINE 118: awful..." and he burst into tears.
LINE 119: Anna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet
LINE 120: steps.
LINE 121: "Pierre!" she said.
LINE 122: Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his
LINE 123: forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
LINE 124: "He is no more...."
LINE 125: Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
LINE 126: "Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as
LINE 127: tears."
LINE 128: She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could
LINE 129: see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was
LINE 130: fast asleep with his head on his arm.
LINE 131: In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:
LINE 132: "Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.
LINE 133: But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command
LINE 134: of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you
LINE 135: well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes
LINE 136: duties on you, and you must be a man."
LINE 137: Pierre was silent.
LINE 138: "Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been
LINE 139: there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised
LINE 140: me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had
LINE 141: no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's
LINE 142: wish?"
LINE 143: Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
LINE 144: silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna
LINE 145: Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs' and went to bed. On waking in
LINE 146: the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details
LINE 147: of Count Bezúkhov's death. She said the count had died as she would
LINE 148: herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As
LINE 149: to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she
LINE 150: could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved
LINE 151: better during those awful moments—the father who so remembered
LINE 152: everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to
LINE 153: the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he
LINE 154: with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his
LINE 155: dying father. "It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the
LINE 156: soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son," said she.
LINE 157: Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasíli she spoke
LINE 158: disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.
