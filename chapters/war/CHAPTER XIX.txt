LINE 1: At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.
LINE 2: The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared
LINE 3: in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day
LINE 4: been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.
LINE 5: "And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?" remarked
LINE 6: Shinshín. "He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be
LINE 7: our turn next."
LINE 8: The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to
LINE 9: the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín's remark.
LINE 10: "It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a
LINE 11: German accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He
LINE 12: declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger
LINE 13: vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell
LINE 14: as ze sanctity of its alliances..." he spoke this last word with
LINE 15: particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.
LINE 16: Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
LINE 17: repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
LINE 18: ... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and absolute
LINE 19: aim—to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided
LINE 20: him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition
LINE 21: for the attainment of that purpose.
LINE 22: "Zat, my dear sir, is vy..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of
LINE 23: wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
LINE 24: "Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* 'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but
LINE 25: turn spindles at home!'?" said Shinshín, puckering his brows and
LINE 26: smiling. "Cela nous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew
LINE 27: what he was about; yet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and where
LINE 28: are we to find Suvórovs now? Je vous demande un peu," *(4) said he,
LINE 29: continually changing from French to Russian.
LINE 30: *Do you know the proverb?
LINE 31: *(2) That suits us down to the ground.
LINE 32: *(3) Hollow.
LINE 33: *(4) I just ask you that.
LINE 34: "Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!" said the colonel,
LINE 35: thumping the table; "and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill
LINE 36: pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible"... he dwelt
LINE 37: particularly on the word possible... "as po-o-ossible," he ended,
LINE 38: again turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and
LINE 39: zere's an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,
LINE 40: how do you judge of it?" he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he
LINE 41: heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with
LINE 42: eyes and ears intent on the colonel.
LINE 43: "I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning
LINE 44: his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision
LINE 45: and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great
LINE 46: danger. "I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer," he
LINE 47: concluded, conscious—as were others—after the words were uttered
LINE 48: that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and
LINE 49: were therefore awkward.
LINE 50: "What you said just now was splendid!" said his partner Julie.
LINE 51: Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and
LINE 52: down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
LINE 53: Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.
LINE 54: "That's fine," said he.
LINE 55: "The young man's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again
LINE 56: thumping the table.
LINE 57: "What are you making such a noise about over there?" Márya
LINE 58: Dmítrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the
LINE 59: table. "What are you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the
LINE 60: hussar, "and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French
LINE 61: are here?"
LINE 62: "I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.
LINE 63: "It's all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You
LINE 64: know my son's going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going."
LINE 65: "I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret. It is all
LINE 66: in God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a
LINE 67: battle," replied Márya Dmítrievna's deep voice, which easily
LINE 68: carried the whole length of the table.
LINE 69: "That's true!"
LINE 70: Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies' at the one end
LINE 71: and the men's at the other.
LINE 72: "You won't ask," Natásha's little brother was saying; "I know
LINE 73: you won't ask!"
LINE 74: "I will," replied Natásha.
LINE 75: Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half
LINE 76: rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what
LINE 77: was coming, and turning to her mother:
LINE 78: "Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
LINE 79: audible the whole length of the table.
LINE 80: "What is it?" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
LINE 81: daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her
LINE 82: sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
LINE 83: The conversation was hushed.
LINE 84: "Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" and Natásha's voice
LINE 85: sounded still more firm and resolute.
LINE 86: The countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her
LINE 87: fat finger.
LINE 88: "Cossack!" she said threateningly.
LINE 89: Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the
LINE 90: elders.
LINE 91: "You had better take care!" said the countess.
LINE 92: "Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" Natásha again cried
LINE 93: boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in
LINE 94: good part.
LINE 95: Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.
LINE 96: "You see! I have asked," whispered Natásha to her little brother
LINE 97: and to Pierre, glancing at him again.
LINE 98: "Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Márya Dmítrievna.
LINE 99: Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
LINE 100: Márya Dmítrievna.
LINE 101: "Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like ice
LINE 102: cream."
LINE 103: "Carrot ices."
LINE 104: "No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?" she almost screamed;
LINE 105: "I want to know!"
LINE 106: Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the
LINE 107: guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna's answer
LINE 108: but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had
LINE 109: dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion.
LINE 110: Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
LINE 111: pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band
LINE 112: again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
LINE 113: their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and reached
LINE 114: across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and
LINE 115: with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and
LINE 116: in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the
LINE 117: guests returned to the drawing room and to the count's study.
