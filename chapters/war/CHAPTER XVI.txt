LINE 1: Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
LINE 2: Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
LINE 3: sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv's was true.
LINE 4: Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been
LINE 5: for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's
LINE 6: house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be
LINE 7: already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were
LINE 8: never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the
LINE 9: count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to
LINE 10: his father's part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the
LINE 11: princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom
LINE 12: were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the
LINE 13: eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The
LINE 14: two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they
LINE 15: differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her
LINE 16: much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.
LINE 17: The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him
LINE 18: with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;
LINE 19: while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and
LINE 20: lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked
LINE 21: by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the
LINE 22: canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying
LINE 23: to make out the pattern.
LINE 24: "How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre. "You don't recognize
LINE 25: me?"
LINE 26: "I recognize you only too well, too well."
LINE 27: "How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,
LINE 28: but unabashed.
LINE 29: "The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you
LINE 30: have done your best to increase his mental sufferings."
LINE 31: "Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked.
LINE 32: "Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
LINE 33: him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready—it is
LINE 34: almost time," she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were
LINE 35: busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,
LINE 36: Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.
LINE 37: Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and
LINE 38: said: "Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see
LINE 39: him."
LINE 40: And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
LINE 41: sister with the mole.
LINE 42: Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count's house.
LINE 43: He sent for Pierre and said to him: "My dear fellow, if you are going
LINE 44: to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that
LINE 45: is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must
LINE 46: not see him at all."
LINE 47: Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
LINE 48: his rooms upstairs.
LINE 49: When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,
LINE 50: stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
LINE 51: as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
LINE 52: over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
LINE 53: indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.
LINE 54: "England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger
LINE 55: at someone unseen. "Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the
LINE 56: rights of man, is sentenced to..." But before Pierre—who at that
LINE 57: moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just
LINE 58: effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured
LINE 59: London—could pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well-built and
LINE 60: handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left
LINE 61: Moscow when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,
LINE 62: but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand
LINE 63: with a friendly smile.
LINE 64: "Do you remember me?" asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile.
LINE 65: "I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not
LINE 66: well."
LINE 67: "Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,"
LINE 68: answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
LINE 69: Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider
LINE 70: it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
LINE 71: embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
LINE 72: "Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a
LINE 73: considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
LINE 74: "Ah, Count Rostóv!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his
LINE 75: son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first. Do you remember
LINE 76: how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It's such an
LINE 77: age..."
LINE 78: "You are mistaken," said Borís deliberately, with a bold and
LINE 79: slightly sarcastic smile. "I am Borís, son of Princess Anna
LINE 80: Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is
LINE 81: Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot."
LINE 82: Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
LINE 83: "Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One
LINE 84: has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now
LINE 85: we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?
LINE 86: The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the
LINE 87: Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve
LINE 88: doesn't make a mess of things!"
LINE 89: Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the
LINE 90: papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.
LINE 91: "We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
LINE 92: than with politics," said he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know
LINE 93: nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy
LINE 94: with gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and
LINE 95: your father."
LINE 96: Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion's
LINE 97: sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.
LINE 98: But Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into
LINE 99: Pierre's eyes.
LINE 100: "Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Borís went on.
LINE 101: "Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,
LINE 102: though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will..."
LINE 103: "Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "very horrid."
LINE 104: Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
LINE 105: something disconcerting to himself.
LINE 106: "And it must seem to you," said Borís flushing slightly, but not
LINE 107: changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that everyone is
LINE 108: trying to get something out of the rich man?"
LINE 109: "So it does," thought Pierre.
LINE 110: "But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
LINE 111: quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are
LINE 112: very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that
LINE 113: your father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and
LINE 114: neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him."
LINE 115: For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped
LINE 116: up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy
LINE 117: way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling
LINE 118: of mingled shame and vexation.
LINE 119: "Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know
LINE 120: very well..."
LINE 121: But Borís again interrupted him.
LINE 122: "I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You
LINE 123: must excuse me," said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put
LINE 124: at ease by him, "but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it
LINE 125: a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to
LINE 126: dinner at the Rostóvs'?"
LINE 127: And Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
LINE 128: extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,
LINE 129: became quite pleasant again.
LINE 130: "No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, "you are a wonderful
LINE 131: fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you
LINE 132: don't know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we
LINE 133: were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.
LINE 134: I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but
LINE 135: it's splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It's
LINE 136: queer," he added after a pause, "that you should have suspected
LINE 137: me!" He began to laugh. "Well, what of it! I hope we'll get better
LINE 138: acquainted," and he pressed Borís' hand. "Do you know, I have not
LINE 139: once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for
LINE 140: him as a man, but what can one do?"
LINE 141: "And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?" asked
LINE 142: Borís with a smile.
LINE 143: Pierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the
LINE 144: same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
LINE 145: Boulogne expedition.
LINE 146: A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in
LINE 147: order to make Borís' better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,
LINE 148: and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
LINE 149: into Borís' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and
LINE 150: down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with
LINE 151: his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,
LINE 152: intelligent, and resolute young man.
LINE 153: As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely
LINE 154: life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
LINE 155: his mind that they would be friends.
LINE 156: Prince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes
LINE 157: and her face was tearful.
LINE 158: "It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, "but cost me what it
LINE 159: may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be
LINE 160: left like this. Every moment is precious. I can't think why his nieces
LINE 161: put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...
LINE 162: Adieu, Prince! May God support you..."
LINE 163: "Adieu, ma bonne," answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.
LINE 164: "Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when
LINE 165: they were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."
LINE 166: "I don't understand, Mamma—what is his attitude to Pierre?"
LINE 167: asked the son.
LINE 168: "The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it."
LINE 169: "But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?"
LINE 170: "Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!"
LINE 171: "Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."
LINE 172: "Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!" exclaimed the mother.
