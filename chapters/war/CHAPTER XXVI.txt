LINE 1: The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
LINE 2: the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house
LINE 3: through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty
LINE 4: times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek.
LINE 5: Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
LINE 6: porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to
LINE 7: alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing
LINE 8: a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in
LINE 9: a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.
LINE 10: Tíkhon knew that neither the son's arrival nor any other unusual
LINE 11: event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince
LINE 12: Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch
LINE 13: as if to ascertain whether his father's habits had changed since he
LINE 14: was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he
LINE 15: turned to his wife.
LINE 16: "He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary's
LINE 17: room," he said.
LINE 18: The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
LINE 19: and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
LINE 20: merrily and prettily as ever.
LINE 21: "Why, this is a palace!" she said to her husband, looking around
LINE 22: with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.
LINE 23: "Let's come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smiled at
LINE 24: Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
LINE 25: "Is that Mary practicing? Let's go quietly and take her by
LINE 26: surprise."
LINE 27: Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
LINE 28: "You've grown older, Tíkhon," he said in passing to the old man,
LINE 29: who kissed his hand.
LINE 30: Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
LINE 31: came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
LINE 32: rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
LINE 33: "Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she: "At last! I must
LINE 34: let her know."
LINE 35: "No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne," said
LINE 36: the little princess, kissing her. "I know you already through my
LINE 37: sister-in-law's friendship for you. She was not expecting us?"
LINE 38: They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
LINE 39: of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and
LINE 40: made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
LINE 41: The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
LINE 42: middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread and the
LINE 43: sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who
LINE 44: had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in
LINE 45: each other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
LINE 46: happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her
LINE 47: hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to
LINE 48: cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as
LINE 49: lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go
LINE 50: of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each
LINE 51: other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began
LINE 52: kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise
LINE 53: both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to
LINE 54: cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women
LINE 55: it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never
LINE 56: entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.
LINE 57: "Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!..." they suddenly exclaimed, and then
LINE 58: laughed. "I dreamed last night..."—"You were not expecting
LINE 59: us?..." "Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?..." "And you have grown
LINE 60: stouter!..."
LINE 61: "I knew the princess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
LINE 62: "And I had no idea!..." exclaimed Princess Mary. "Ah, Andrew, I
LINE 63: did not see you."
LINE 64: Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and
LINE 65: he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had
LINE 66: turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,
LINE 67: gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
LINE 68: rested on Prince Andrew's face.
LINE 69: The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip
LINE 70: continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
LINE 71: and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
LINE 72: glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had
LINE 73: had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
LINE 74: condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left
LINE 75: all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
LINE 76: to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty
LINE 77: Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,
LINE 78: a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was
LINE 79: still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
LINE 80: of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of
LINE 81: thought independent of her sister-in-law's words. In the midst of a
LINE 82: description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:
LINE 83: "So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said sighing.
LINE 84: Lise sighed too.
LINE 85: "Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her brother.
LINE 86: "He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
LINE 87: promotion..."
LINE 88: Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
LINE 89: thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.
LINE 90: "Is it certain?" she said.
LINE 91: The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: "Yes,
LINE 92: quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful..."
LINE 93: Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law's
LINE 94: and unexpectedly again began to cry.
LINE 95: "She needs rest," said Prince Andrew with a frown. "Don't you,
LINE 96: Lise? Take her to your room and I'll go to Father. How is he? Just the
LINE 97: same?"
LINE 98: "Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what your opinion will
LINE 99: be," answered the princess joyfully.
LINE 100: "And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
LINE 101: lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
LINE 102: showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was
LINE 103: aware of his weaknesses.
LINE 104: "The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and
LINE 105: my geometry lessons," said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons
LINE 106: in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
LINE 107: When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
LINE 108: prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father.
LINE 109: The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
LINE 110: son's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
LINE 111: he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned
LINE 112: style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew
LINE 113: entered his father's dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and
LINE 114: manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which
LINE 115: he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered
LINE 116: chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.
LINE 117: "Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?" said the
LINE 118: old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon
LINE 119: was holding fast to plait, would allow.
LINE 120: "You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like
LINE 121: this he'll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?" And he
LINE 122: held out his cheek.
LINE 123: The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He
LINE 124: used to say that a nap "after dinner was silver—before dinner,
LINE 125: golden.") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his
LINE 126: thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on
LINE 127: the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father's favorite
LINE 128: topic—making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly
LINE 129: of Bonaparte.
LINE 130: "Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is
LINE 131: pregnant," said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his
LINE 132: father's face with an eager and respectful look. "How is your
LINE 133: health?"
LINE 134: "Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from
LINE 135: morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well."
LINE 136: "Thank God," said his son smiling.
LINE 137: "God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on," he continued,
LINE 138: returning to his hobby; "tell me how the Germans have taught you to
LINE 139: fight Bonaparte by this new science you call 'strategy.'"
LINE 140: Prince Andrew smiled.
LINE 141: "Give me time to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile
LINE 142: that showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from
LINE 143: loving and honoring him. "Why, I have not yet had time to settle
LINE 144: down!"
LINE 145: "Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to
LINE 146: see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. "The
LINE 147: house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and
LINE 148: show her over, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen. That's
LINE 149: their woman's way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About
LINE 150: Mikhelson's army I understand—Tolstóy's too... a simultaneous
LINE 151: expedition.... But what's the southern army to do? Prussia is
LINE 152: neutral... I know that. What about Austria?" said he, rising from his
LINE 153: chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after
LINE 154: him, handing him different articles of clothing. "What of Sweden? How
LINE 155: will they cross Pomerania?"
LINE 156: Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first
LINE 157: reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit
LINE 158: changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to explain
LINE 159: the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,
LINE 160: ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out
LINE 161: of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was
LINE 162: to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty
LINE 163: thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in
LINE 164: Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
LINE 165: were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand
LINE 166: men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did
LINE 167: not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
LINE 168: not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
LINE 169: times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: "The
LINE 170: white one, the white one!"
LINE 171: This meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.
LINE 172: Another time he interrupted, saying:
LINE 173: "And will she soon be confined?" and shaking his head reproachfully
LINE 174: said: "That's bad! Go on, go on."
LINE 175: The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
LINE 176: description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:
LINE 177: "Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra." *
LINE 178: * "Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll
LINE 179: return."
LINE 180: His son only smiled.
LINE 181: "I don't say it's a plan I approve of," said the son; "I am
LINE 182: only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,
LINE 183: not worse than this one."
LINE 184: "Well, you've told me nothing new," and the old man repeated,
LINE 185: meditatively and rapidly:
LINE 186: "Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room."
