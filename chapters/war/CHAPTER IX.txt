LINE 1: It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
LINE 2: cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
LINE 3: to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he
LINE 4: felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light
LINE 5: enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
LINE 6: morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole
LINE 7: Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which
LINE 8: there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
LINE 9: Pierre was very fond of.
LINE 10: "I should like to go to Kurágin's," thought he.
LINE 11: But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
LINE 12: there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
LINE 13: passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
LINE 14: that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his
LINE 15: promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it
LINE 16: he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering;
LINE 17: "besides," thought he, "all such 'words of honor' are
LINE 18: conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
LINE 19: one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
LINE 20: extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the
LINE 21: same!" Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying
LINE 22: all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin's.
LINE 23: Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which
LINE 24: Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
LINE 25: and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty
LINE 26: bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
LINE 27: alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
LINE 28: Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
LINE 29: Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the
LINE 30: remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
LINE 31: the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of
LINE 32: laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
LINE 33: general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
LINE 34: round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one
LINE 35: pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
LINE 36: "I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.
LINE 37: "Mind, no holding on!" cried another.
LINE 38: "I bet on Dólokhov!" cried a third. "Kurágin, you part our
LINE 39: hands."
LINE 40: "There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."
LINE 41: "At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.
LINE 42: "Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
LINE 43: who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine
LINE 44: linen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is
LINE 45: Pétya! Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.
LINE 46: Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
LINE 47: particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
LINE 48: ring, cried from the window: "Come here; part the bets!" This was
LINE 49: Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and
LINE 50: duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him
LINE 51: merrily.
LINE 52: "I don't understand. What's it all about?"
LINE 53: "Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatole, and
LINE 54: taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
LINE 55: "First of all you must drink!"
LINE 56: Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
LINE 57: the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
LINE 58: to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass while
LINE 59: explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval
LINE 60: officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
LINE 61: of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
LINE 62: "Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
LINE 63: glass, "or I won't let you go!"
LINE 64: "No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
LINE 65: to the window.
LINE 66: Dólokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and distinctly
LINE 67: repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
LINE 68: Anatole and Pierre.
LINE 69: Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He
LINE 70: was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,
LINE 71: so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly
LINE 72: seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle
LINE 73: of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
LINE 74: lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually
LINE 75: round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,
LINE 76: insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it
LINE 77: impossible not to notice his face. Dólokhov was a man of small means
LINE 78: and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of
LINE 79: rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
LINE 80: footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him
LINE 81: more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all games and nearly
LINE 82: always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
LINE 83: Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes
LINE 84: and scapegraces of Petersburg.
LINE 85: The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone
LINE 86: from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
LINE 87: were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
LINE 88: the gentlemen around.
LINE 89: Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to
LINE 90: smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
LINE 91: could not move it. He smashed a pane.
LINE 92: "You have a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.
LINE 93: Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
LINE 94: a crash.
LINE 95: "Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said
LINE 96: Dólokhov.
LINE 97: "Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.
LINE 98: "First-rate," said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle
LINE 99: of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
LINE 100: the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
LINE 101: Dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window
LINE 102: sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
LINE 103: room. All were silent.
LINE 104: "I bet fifty imperials"—he spoke French that the Englishman might
LINE 105: understand him, but he did not speak it very well—"I bet fifty
LINE 106: imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he,
LINE 107: addressing the Englishman.
LINE 108: "No, fifty," replied the latter.
LINE 109: "All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of
LINE 110: rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
LINE 111: spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)
LINE 112: "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"
LINE 113: "Quite right," said the Englishman.
LINE 114: Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
LINE 115: of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began
LINE 116: repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
LINE 117: "Wait!" cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window
LINE 118: sill to attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If
LINE 119: anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you
LINE 120: understand?"
LINE 121: The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
LINE 122: accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though
LINE 123: he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating
LINE 124: Dólokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the
LINE 125: Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
LINE 126: sill, leaned over, and looked down.
LINE 127: "Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the
LINE 128: stones of the pavement.
LINE 129: "Shut up!" cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The
LINE 130: lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
LINE 131: Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
LINE 132: Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
LINE 133: his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself
LINE 134: on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
LINE 135: the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and
LINE 136: placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
LINE 137: Dólokhov's back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit
LINE 138: up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in
LINE 139: front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others
LINE 140: present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted
LINE 141: to seize hold of Dólokhov's shirt.
LINE 142: "I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible
LINE 143: man.
LINE 144: Anatole stopped him.
LINE 145: "Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.
LINE 146: Eh?... What then?... Eh?"
LINE 147: Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
LINE 148: himself on his seat.
LINE 149: "If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words
LINE 150: separately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down
LINE 151: there. Now then!"
LINE 152: Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
LINE 153: and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
LINE 154: to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
LINE 155: broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
LINE 156: window and from Dólokhov's back. Anatole stood erect with staring
LINE 157: eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man
LINE 158: who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
LINE 159: himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from
LINE 160: which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed
LINE 161: horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.
LINE 162: Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown
LINE 163: further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
LINE 164: holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
LINE 165: effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
LINE 166: and his head tilting yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought
LINE 167: Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.
LINE 168: Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm
LINE 169: trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip
LINE 170: as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and
LINE 171: arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch
LINE 172: the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered
LINE 173: his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was
LINE 174: aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the
LINE 175: window sill, with a pale but radiant face.
LINE 176: "It's empty."
LINE 177: He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov
LINE 178: jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.
LINE 179: "Well done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil take
LINE 180: you!" came from different sides.
LINE 181: The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
LINE 182: Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the
LINE 183: window sill.
LINE 184: "Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!"
LINE 185: he suddenly cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
LINE 186: bottle. I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"
LINE 187: "Let him do it, let him do it," said Dólokhov, smiling.
LINE 188: "What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go
LINE 189: giddy even on a staircase," exclaimed several voices.
LINE 190: "I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre,
LINE 191: banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
LINE 192: climb out of the window.
LINE 193: They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
LINE 194: touched him was sent flying.
LINE 195: "No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a
LINE 196: bit and I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow,
LINE 197: but now we are all going to ——'s."
LINE 198: "Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin
LINE 199: with us."
LINE 200: And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
LINE 201: and began dancing round the room with it.
