LINE 1: While in the Rostóvs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced,
LINE 2: to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired
LINE 3: footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a
LINE 4: sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute
LINE 5: confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations
LINE 6: made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle
LINE 7: and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond
LINE 8: the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,
LINE 9: waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.
LINE 10: The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending
LINE 11: aides-de-camp to inquire after the count's health, came himself
LINE 12: that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of
LINE 13: Catherine's court, Count Bezúkhov.
LINE 14: The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
LINE 15: respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
LINE 16: hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
LINE 17: bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
LINE 18: on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince
LINE 19: Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,
LINE 20: escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in
LINE 21: low tones.
LINE 22: When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone
LINE 23: on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,
LINE 24: leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After
LINE 25: sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened
LINE 26: eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading
LINE 27: to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.
LINE 28: Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
LINE 29: whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man's
LINE 30: room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
LINE 31: his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
LINE 32: "The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be
LINE 33: o'erpassed," said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat
LINE 34: beside him and was listening naïvely to his words.
LINE 35: "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the
LINE 36: lady, adding the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion of
LINE 37: her own on the subject.
LINE 38: "Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied the priest, passing
LINE 39: his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
LINE 40: bald head.
LINE 41: "Who was that? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at
LINE 42: the other side of the room. "How young-looking he is!"
LINE 43: "Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
LINE 44: anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."
LINE 45: "I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times."
LINE 46: The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
LINE 47: from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
LINE 48: graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
LINE 49: table.
LINE 50: "Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about the
LINE 51: weather. "The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow
LINE 52: one feels as if one were in the country."
LINE 53: "Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh. "So he may have
LINE 54: something to drink?"
LINE 55: Lorrain considered.
LINE 56: "Has he taken his medicine?"
LINE 57: "Yes."
LINE 58: The doctor glanced at his watch.
LINE 59: "Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,"
LINE 60: and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
LINE 61: "Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was saying to an
LINE 62: aide-de-camp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."
LINE 63: "And what a well-preserved man he was!" remarked the aide-de-camp.
LINE 64: "And who will inherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper.
LINE 65: "It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.
LINE 66: Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second
LINE 67: princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
LINE 68: Lorrain's instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
LINE 69: "Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German,
LINE 70: addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
LINE 71: Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before
LINE 72: his nose.
LINE 73: "Tonight, not later," said he in a low voice, and he moved away
LINE 74: with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to
LINE 75: understand and state the patient's condition.
LINE 76: Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess' room.
LINE 77: In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
LINE 78: the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
LINE 79: The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,
LINE 80: cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was
LINE 81: just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.
LINE 82: "Ah, is it you, cousin?"
LINE 83: She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth
LINE 84: that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
LINE 85: varnish.
LINE 86: "Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."
LINE 87: "No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,
LINE 88: Catiche," * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair
LINE 89: she had just vacated. "You have made the place warm, I must say," he
LINE 90: remarked. "Well, sit down: let's have a talk."
LINE 91: *Catherine.
LINE 92: "I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her
LINE 93: unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the
LINE 94: prince, she prepared to listen.
LINE 95: "I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."
LINE 96: "Well, my dear?" said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it
LINE 97: downwards as was his habit.
LINE 98: It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both
LINE 99: understood without naming.
LINE 100: The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her
LINE 101: legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her
LINE 102: prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
LINE 103: with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow
LINE 104: and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince
LINE 105: Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness.
LINE 106: "And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn
LINE 107: out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
LINE 108: very serious talk."
LINE 109: Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,
LINE 110: now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant
LINE 111: expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes
LINE 112: too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the
LINE 113: next glanced round in alarm.
LINE 114: The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
LINE 115: hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli's eyes evidently
LINE 116: resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till
LINE 117: morning.
LINE 118: "Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,"
LINE 119: continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not
LINE 120: without an inner struggle; "at such a moment as this one must think
LINE 121: of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you
LINE 122: all, like children of my own, as you know."
LINE 123: The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same
LINE 124: dull expression.
LINE 125: "And then of course my family has also to be considered," Prince
LINE 126: Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at
LINE 127: her. "You know, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and
LINE 128: my wife—are the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard
LINE 129: it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for
LINE 130: me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
LINE 131: anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count," pointing to
LINE 132: his portrait, "definitely demanded that he should be called."
LINE 133: Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make
LINE 134: out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
LINE 135: simply looking at him.
LINE 136: "There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin," she
LINE 137: replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow
LINE 138: his noble soul peacefully to leave this..."
LINE 139: "Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently,
LINE 140: rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
LINE 141: table that he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you
LINE 142: know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left
LINE 143: all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."
LINE 144: "He has made wills enough!" quietly remarked the princess. "But he
LINE 145: cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate."
LINE 146: "But, my dear," said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little
LINE 147: table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: "what if
LINE 148: a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for
LINE 149: Pierre's legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the
LINE 150: count's services, his request would be granted?..."
LINE 151: The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
LINE 152: subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
LINE 153: "I can tell you more," continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand,
LINE 154: "that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew
LINE 155: of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then
LINE 156: as soon as all is over," and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he
LINE 157: meant by the words all is over, "and the count's papers are opened,
LINE 158: the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition
LINE 159: will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate
LINE 160: son."
LINE 161: "And our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if
LINE 162: anything might happen, only not that.
LINE 163: "But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the
LINE 164: legal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must know,
LINE 165: my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have
LINE 166: been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you
LINE 167: ought to know where they are, and must find them, because..."
LINE 168: "What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
LINE 169: changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you think we
LINE 170: are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...
LINE 171: un bâtard!"* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
LINE 172: word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his
LINE 173: contention.
LINE 174: * A bastard.
LINE 175: "Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so
LINE 176: intelligent, how is it you don't see that if the count has written a
LINE 177: letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it
LINE 178: follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov,
LINE 179: and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and
LINE 180: letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation
LINE 181: of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit!* That's certain."
LINE 182: * And all that follows therefrom.
LINE 183: "I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;
LINE 184: and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool," said the
LINE 185: princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are
LINE 186: saying something witty and stinging.
LINE 187: "My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna," began Prince Vasíli
LINE 188: impatiently, "I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about
LINE 189: your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I
LINE 190: tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the
LINE 191: will in Pierre's favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear
LINE 192: girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don't believe me,
LINE 193: then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich"
LINE 194: (the family solicitor) "and he says the same."
LINE 195: At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas;
LINE 196: her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice
LINE 197: when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
LINE 198: evidently did not expect.
LINE 199: "That would be a fine thing!" said she. "I never wanted anything
LINE 200: and I don't now."
LINE 201: She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
LINE 202: "And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have
LINE 203: sacrificed everything for his sake!" she cried. "It's splendid!
LINE 204: Fine! I don't want anything, Prince."
LINE 205: "Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters..."
LINE 206: replied Prince Vasíli.
LINE 207: But the princess did not listen to him.
LINE 208: "Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect
LINE 209: nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude—the
LINE 210: blackest ingratitude—in this house..."
LINE 211: "Do you or do you not know where that will is?" insisted Prince
LINE 212: Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.
LINE 213: "Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and
LINE 214: sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has
LINE 215: been intriguing!"
LINE 216: The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She
LINE 217: had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
LINE 218: She gave her companion an angry glance.
LINE 219: "There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was
LINE 220: all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards
LINE 221: forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his
LINE 222: last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let
LINE 223: him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who..."
LINE 224: "Who sacrificed everything for him," chimed in the princess, who
LINE 225: would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, "though
LINE 226: he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin," she added with a sigh,
LINE 227: "I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,
LINE 228: that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one
LINE 229: has to be cunning and cruel."
LINE 230: "Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart."
LINE 231: "No, I have a wicked heart."
LINE 232: "I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I value your friendship
LINE 233: and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself,
LINE 234: and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it
LINE 235: but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where
LINE 236: it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the
LINE 237: count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.
LINE 238: You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
LINE 239: wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him
LINE 240: and you."
LINE 241: "Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!" cried
LINE 242: the princess.
LINE 243: "That's not the point, my dear."
LINE 244: "It's that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya,
LINE 245: that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the
LINE 246: infamous, vile woman!"
LINE 247: "Do not let us lose any time..."
LINE 248: "Ah, don't talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and
LINE 249: told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about
LINE 250: Sophie—I can't repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he
LINE 251: would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this
LINE 252: vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid."
LINE 253: "We've got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it
LINE 254: sooner?"
LINE 255: "It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,"
LINE 256: said the princess, ignoring his question. "Now I know! Yes; if I have
LINE 257: a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!" almost shrieked
LINE 258: the princess, now quite changed. "And what does she come worming
LINE 259: herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time
LINE 260: will come!"
