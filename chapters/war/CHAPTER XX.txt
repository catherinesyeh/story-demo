LINE 1: The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the
LINE 2: count's visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,
LINE 3: some in the sitting room, some in the library.
LINE 4: The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from
LINE 5: dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.
LINE 6: The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered round the
LINE 7: clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she
LINE 8: had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the
LINE 9: other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for
LINE 10: their musical talent, to sing something. Natásha, who was treated as
LINE 11: though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the
LINE 12: same time felt shy.
LINE 13: "What shall we sing?" she said.
LINE 14: "'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.
LINE 15: "Well, then, let's be quick. Borís, come here," said Natásha.
LINE 16: "But where is Sónya?"
LINE 17: She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
LINE 18: look for her.
LINE 19: Running into Sónya's room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to
LINE 20: the nursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that
LINE 21: she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was
LINE 22: the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv
LINE 23: household. And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse's
LINE 24: dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink
LINE 25: dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing
LINE 26: so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Natásha's
LINE 27: face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint's day, suddenly
LINE 28: changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad
LINE 29: neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.
LINE 30: "Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!" And
LINE 31: Natásha's large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she
LINE 32: began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was
LINE 33: crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and
LINE 34: hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the
LINE 35: blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya
LINE 36: sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.
LINE 37: "Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... have
LINE 38: come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry," and she
LINE 39: showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had
LINE 40: written, "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can
LINE 41: understand... what a soul he has!"
LINE 42: And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
LINE 43: "It's all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and
LINE 44: Borís also," she went on, gaining a little strength; "he is nice...
LINE 45: there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...
LINE 46: one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it
LINE 47: can't be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sónya looked upon
LINE 48: the countess as her mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling
LINE 49: Nicholas' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God
LINE 50: is my witness," and she made the sign of the cross, "I love her so
LINE 51: much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What have I done
LINE 52: to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice
LINE 53: everything, only I have nothing...."
LINE 54: Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in
LINE 55: the feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that
LINE 56: she understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble.
LINE 57: "Sónya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
LINE 58: reason of her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure Véra has said something
LINE 59: to you since dinner? Hasn't she?"
LINE 60: "Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others,
LINE 61: and she found them on my table and said she'd show them to Mamma, and
LINE 62: that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry
LINE 63: me, but that he'll marry Julie. You see how he's been with her all
LINE 64: day... Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?..."
LINE 65: And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted
LINE 66: her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting
LINE 67: her.
LINE 68: "Sónya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! Do you
LINE 69: remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting
LINE 70: room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don't
LINE 71: quite remember how, but don't you remember that it could all be
LINE 72: arranged and how nice it all was? There's Uncle Shinshín's brother
LINE 73: has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.
LINE 74: And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about
LINE 75: it. And he is so clever and so good!" said Natásha. "Don't
LINE 76: you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!" and she kissed her and
LINE 77: laughed. "Véra's spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right
LINE 78: and she won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,
LINE 79: and he doesn't care at all for Julie."
LINE 80: Natásha kissed her on the hair.
LINE 81: Sónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
LINE 82: seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
LINE 83: playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
LINE 84: "Do you think so?... Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her
LINE 85: frock and hair.
LINE 86: "Really, truly!" answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
LINE 87: strayed from under her friend's plaits.
LINE 88: Both laughed.
LINE 89: "Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook.'"
LINE 90: "Come along!"
LINE 91: "Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!" said
LINE 92: Natásha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"
LINE 93: And she set off at a run along the passage.
LINE 94: Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
LINE 95: verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran
LINE 96: after Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
LINE 97: and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request the young people
LINE 98: sang the quartette, "The Brook," with which everyone was delighted.
LINE 99: Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
LINE 100: At nighttime in the moon's fair glow
LINE 101: How sweet, as fancies wander free,
LINE 102: To feel that in this world there's one
LINE 103: Who still is thinking but of thee!
LINE 104: That while her fingers touch the harp
LINE 105: Wafting sweet music o'er the lea,
LINE 106: It is for thee thus swells her heart,
LINE 107: Sighing its message out to thee...
LINE 108: A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
LINE 109: But oh! till then I cannot live!...
LINE 110: He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to
LINE 111: get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the
LINE 112: coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
LINE 113: Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him,
LINE 114: as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in
LINE 115: which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began
LINE 116: Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and
LINE 117: blushing:
LINE 118: "Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers."
LINE 119: "I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied; "but if you
LINE 120: will be my teacher..." And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
LINE 121: slender little girl.
LINE 122: While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
LINE 123: Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natásha was perfectly happy;
LINE 124: she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was
LINE 125: sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.
LINE 126: She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.
LINE 127: Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where
LINE 128: she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and
LINE 129: smiling over the fan.
LINE 130: "Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she
LINE 131: crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha.
LINE 132: Natásha blushed and laughed.
LINE 133: "Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised
LINE 134: at?"
LINE 135: In the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
LINE 136: pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna
LINE 137: had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and
LINE 138: older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,
LINE 139: and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First
LINE 140: came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The
LINE 141: count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his
LINE 142: bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair
LINE 143: gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the
LINE 144: écossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted
LINE 145: up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:
LINE 146: "Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"
LINE 147: This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.
LINE 148: (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)
LINE 149: "Look at Papa!" shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite
LINE 150: forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
LINE 151: curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
LINE 152: And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
LINE 153: jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
LINE 154: Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
LINE 155: shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by
LINE 156: a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
LINE 157: onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay
LINE 158: strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
LINE 159: dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
LINE 160: filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on
LINE 161: the other—who with beaming faces had come to see their master making
LINE 162: merry.
LINE 163: "Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!" loudly remarked
LINE 164: the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
LINE 165: The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not
LINE 166: want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms
LINE 167: hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her
LINE 168: stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed
LINE 169: by the whole of the count's plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found
LINE 170: expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.
LINE 171: But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed
LINE 172: the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and
LINE 173: the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya
LINE 174: Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least
LINE 175: effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp
LINE 176: her foot—which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual
LINE 177: severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could
LINE 178: not attract a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did not
LINE 179: even try to do so. All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna.
LINE 180: Natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to
LINE 181: "look at Papa!" though as it was they never took their eyes off the
LINE 182: couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved
LINE 183: and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;
LINE 184: lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying
LINE 185: round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,
LINE 186: turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,
LINE 187: raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling
LINE 188: and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and
LINE 189: laughter led by Natásha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily
LINE 190: and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
LINE 191: "That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chère," said the
LINE 192: count.
LINE 193: "That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up
LINE 194: her sleeves and puffing heavily.
