LINE 1: Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was
LINE 2: already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into
LINE 3: his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From
LINE 4: time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" They
LINE 5: were expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society as le
LINE 6: terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for
LINE 7: common sense and frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known
LINE 8: to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both
LINE 9: cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told
LINE 10: good stories about her, while none the less all without exception
LINE 11: respected and feared her.
LINE 12: In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked
LINE 13: of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the
LINE 14: recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew
LINE 15: it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were
LINE 16: smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head
LINE 17: first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident
LINE 18: pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he
LINE 19: egged on against each other.
LINE 20: One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
LINE 21: face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable
LINE 22: young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
LINE 23: having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
LINE 24: smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,
LINE 25: Shinshín, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a sharp tongue"
LINE 26: as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to
LINE 27: his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,
LINE 28: irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the
LINE 29: middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting
LINE 30: it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an
LINE 31: officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join
LINE 32: the army, and about whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra,
LINE 33: speaking of Berg as her "intended." The count sat between them and
LINE 34: listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a
LINE 35: card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he
LINE 36: succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.
LINE 37: "Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable Alphonse Kárlovich,"
LINE 38: said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian
LINE 39: expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity
LINE 40: of his speech. "Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'état; *
LINE 41: you want to make something out of your company?"
LINE 42: * You expect to make an income out of the government.
LINE 43: "No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry
LINE 44: the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own
LINE 45: position now, Peter Nikoláevich..."
LINE 46: Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
LINE 47: conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
LINE 48: and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
LINE 49: on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
LINE 50: out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as
LINE 51: soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
LINE 52: circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
LINE 53: "Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I
LINE 54: should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even
LINE 55: with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and
LINE 56: thirty," said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful,
LINE 57: pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must
LINE 58: always be the chief desire of everyone else.
LINE 59: "Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards
LINE 60: I shall be in a more prominent position," continued Berg, "and
LINE 61: vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think
LINE 62: what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to
LINE 63: put a little aside and to send something to my father," he went on,
LINE 64: emitting a smoke ring.
LINE 65: "La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
LINE 66: proverb says," remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side
LINE 67: of his mouth and winking at the count.
LINE 68: * So that squares matters.
LINE 69: The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín
LINE 70: was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,
LINE 71: continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
LINE 72: gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime
LINE 73: the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,
LINE 74: might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in
LINE 75: the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently
LINE 76: enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,
LINE 77: too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily
LINE 78: sedate, and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that
LINE 79: he disarmed his hearers.
LINE 80: "Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go—foot or
LINE 81: horse—that I'll warrant," said Shinshín, patting him on the
LINE 82: shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.
LINE 83: Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the
LINE 84: drawing room.
LINE 85: It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,
LINE 86: expecting the summons to zakúska, * avoid engaging in any long
LINE 87: conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order
LINE 88: to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and
LINE 89: hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,
LINE 90: and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are
LINE 91: waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish
LINE 92: that is not yet ready.
LINE 93: * Hors d'oeuvres.
LINE 94: Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
LINE 95: middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,
LINE 96: blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,
LINE 97: but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in
LINE 98: search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He
LINE 99: was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of
LINE 100: the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity
LINE 101: at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest
LINE 102: fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.
LINE 103: "You have only lately arrived?" the countess asked him.
LINE 104: "Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.
LINE 105: "You have not yet seen my husband?"
LINE 106: "Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.
LINE 107: "You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very
LINE 108: interesting."
LINE 109: "Very interesting."
LINE 110: The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter
LINE 111: understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
LINE 112: sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
LINE 113: answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
LINE 114: guests were all conversing with one another. "The Razumóvskis... It
LINE 115: was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina..." was heard
LINE 116: on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
LINE 117: "Márya Dmítrievna?" came her voice from there.
LINE 118: "Herself," came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna
LINE 119: entered the room.
LINE 120: All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
LINE 121: oldest rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,
LINE 122: holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood
LINE 123: surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
LINE 124: rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.
LINE 125: "Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
LINE 126: children," she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all
LINE 127: others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, turning to the count
LINE 128: who was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?
LINE 129: Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just
LINE 130: see how these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed to the girls.
LINE 131: "You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not...."
LINE 132: "Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" (Márya Dmítrievna
LINE 133: always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as
LINE 134: she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a scamp
LINE 135: of a girl, but I like her."
LINE 136: She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,
LINE 137: having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure
LINE 138: of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
LINE 139: Pierre.
LINE 140: "Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high
LINE 141: tone of voice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked
LINE 142: up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a
LINE 143: childlike way through his spectacles.
LINE 144: "Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
LINE 145: your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my
LINE 146: evident duty." She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
LINE 147: follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.
LINE 148: "A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed
LINE 149: and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,
LINE 150: sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war."
LINE 151: She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep
LINE 152: from laughing.
LINE 153: "Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Márya
LINE 154: Dmítrievna.
LINE 155: The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed
LINE 156: on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because
LINE 157: Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna
LINE 158: with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina
LINE 159: went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the
LINE 160: whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses
LINE 161: followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the
LINE 162: band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their
LINE 163: places. Then the strains of the count's household band were replaced
LINE 164: by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the
LINE 165: soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with
LINE 166: Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the
LINE 167: other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,
LINE 168: with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male
LINE 169: visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the
LINE 170: grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and
LINE 171: on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind
LINE 172: the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his
LINE 173: wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled
LINE 174: his neighbors' glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,
LINE 175: without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from
LINE 176: behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed
LINE 177: by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the
LINE 178: ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the
LINE 179: men's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the
LINE 180: colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so
LINE 181: much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg
LINE 182: with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but
LINE 183: a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the
LINE 184: guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting
LINE 185: opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a
LINE 186: great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
LINE 187: went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.
LINE 188: These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a
LINE 189: napkin, from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry
LINE 190: Madeira"... "Hungarian"... or "Rhine wine" as the case might
LINE 191: be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram
LINE 192: that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank
LINE 193: with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other
LINE 194: guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of
LINE 195: thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
LINE 196: the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny
LINE 197: lively little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
LINE 198: why.
LINE 199: Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to
LINE 200: whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore
LINE 201: a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned
LINE 202: pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas
LINE 203: and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round
LINE 204: uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
LINE 205: children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,
LINE 206: and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner
LINE 207: to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler
LINE 208: with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to
LINE 209: appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because
LINE 210: no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
LINE 211: greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for
LINE 212: knowledge.
