LINE 1: A LULL IN THE STORM.
LINE 2: There was a lull in the storm as soon as the two Whig candidates were
LINE 3: elected to represent the city of Bristol, and Mr. Hart-Davis withdrew
LINE 4: quietly from the contest. The undercurrent, it is true, was still
LINE 5: muttering and murmuring of evil times to come, and all thinking men who
LINE 6: looked below the surface knew that it would but need a spark to kindle a
LINE 7: great fire in Bristol, and that much wisdom, firmness, and decision,
LINE 8: would be needed amongst the rulers.
LINE 9: Joyce Arundel, in her happy home life, soon lost the sense of
LINE 10: insecurity, which after that memorable drive from Fair Acres, had at
LINE 11: first haunted her.
LINE 12: Falcon's lessons, and the interest she felt in his rapid advancement,
LINE 13: engrossed her every morning when her household duties were over; and
LINE 14: then she would pace up and down the garden overlooking the city, with
LINE 15: her baby in her arms, while Lota and Lettice played on the wide expanse
LINE 16: of even, if rather smoke-dried, turf, which sloped down from the terrace
LINE 17: walk at the back of the house, and tell herself a hundred times that no
LINE 18: wife or mother in England was happier than she was.
LINE 19: The early married life of a mother whose chief interests centre in her
LINE 20: own home, and who knows no craving for anything that lies beyond, is
LINE 21: happy indeed. As years pass and her children vanish, and the sweetness
LINE 22: of entire dependence on her ceases of necessity with infancy and
LINE 23: childhood, the mother, weary with the battle of life, encompassed with
LINE 24: difficulties, and overburdened with requirements which the failing
LINE 25: strength of advancing years makes it hard to fulfil, can turn back to
LINE 26: that fair oasis in her pilgrimage, when the children were with her day
LINE 27: and night, when her hand had power to soothe a childish trouble, and her
LINE 28: voice charm away a little pain or disappointment, or add, by her
LINE 29: sympathy in joys as well as in sorrows, zest to all those simple
LINE 30: pleasures in which children delight.
LINE 31: Sometimes, even to the best mothers, I know, there comes a sudden, sharp
LINE 32: awakening. The son of much love and many prayers goes far astray; the
LINE 33: daughter, her pride and joy in her early childhood, is apparently cold
LINE 34: and heartless. But as a rule, I think, in the retrospect the cry is
LINE 35: forced from many a mother's sad heart: "If only I had been more to him
LINE 36: in early boyhood; cared for his games, and interested myself in all his
LINE 37: play as well as work, it _might_ have been different"; or, "If I had
LINE 38: dealt more tenderly and patiently with her when she was standing on the
LINE 39: threshold of womanhood, it might have been different!"
LINE 40: Vain regrets, vain laments for some of us; but the young mother, like
LINE 41: Joyce Falconer, has the children and the father of the children still
LINE 42: with her, and may, as Joyce did, sing to herself a sweet, low song of
LINE 43: thanksgiving, which made Lettice stop in her play, and, running up to
LINE 44: her side, say:
LINE 45: "What a pretty song mother is singing to baby!"
LINE 46: And now another voice was heard, rather a sad, querulous voice, which
LINE 47: did not chime in well with the mother's song, or the baby's gentle coo
LINE 48: of gladness, or the laughter of the two little sisters, as Falcon dashed
LINE 49: out upon them from the open door of the hall with a big ball in his
LINE 50: hand, which he threw down the grass with a merry "Halloo!"
LINE 51: Falcon's lessons, which his mother had left him to learn, were over, and
LINE 52: he was free to run and jump to his heart's content.
LINE 53: "Joyce, are you not coming to get ready? Aunt Falconer never likes to be
LINE 54: kept waiting."
LINE 55: "Oh! I beg your pardon, Charlotte; I had forgotten you and I were to
LINE 56: spend the day with mother; I will be ready in a few minutes. I must just
LINE 57: wait till Susan can take baby." Susan appeared at this moment, and Joyce
LINE 58: went quickly into the hall.
LINE 59: Poor Charlotte's visions and dreams had never come to be anything but
LINE 60: dreams. She was older than Joyce, and still had never found the language
LINE 61: of the eyes come to a good honest declaration of love, still less to an
LINE 62: offer of marriage. She was just now on a visit to her cousin, Miss
LINE 63: Falconer being very ready to spare her, hoping that in Clifton or
LINE 64: Bristol she might find a cure for her low spirits, and generally
LINE 65: dejected air, which her aunt did not like to have remarked upon by the
LINE 66: gossips of Wells, and which had certainly very much increased of late.
LINE 67: * * * * *
LINE 68: Joyce ran upstairs to prepare for her visit, and on the first floor
LINE 69: found Mrs. Arundel.
LINE 70: "Mr. Bengough has been here, Joyce, with great news; the Bill was
LINE 71: carried with a large majority in the Commons, and now there is only the
LINE 72: Lords, and surely they will not turn it out."
LINE 73: Falcon, who had rushed up to the nursery to find his reins and whip,
LINE 74: that he might make a pair of ponies of his little sisters, stopped as he
LINE 75: heard his grandmother say:
LINE 76: "It is great news, and a great victory."
LINE 77: "What battle is it? Tell me, mother, who has been fighting?"
LINE 78: "It was not a battle with swords or guns, Falcon; but when you are a man
LINE 79: you may remember that you heard, when you were a little boy, that on the
LINE 80: nineteenth of September, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, the great
LINE 81: Reform Bill was carried by a number of votes."
LINE 82: "Then will all those angry people we saw when we came home from Fair
LINE 83: Acres be happy and good now. Susan says they shouted 'Reform, Reform,'
LINE 84: because they wanted bread; but I don't know what it means," said Falcon,
LINE 85: thoughtfully. "If it's a good thing, it ought to make people better,
LINE 86: oughn't it, Grannie?"
LINE 87: It was profound philosophy for six years old! The necessary consequence
LINE 88: of good must be something _better_.
LINE 89: Joyce, thinking of those angry faces crowding round her and her babies,
LINE 90: and of the one terrible face which conjured up such a host of dreadful
LINE 91: memories, sighed.
LINE 92: "Ah! Falcon," she said, "good things cannot come all at once--good
LINE 93: results, I mean; but give me a kiss and run away, and mind you give
LINE 94: Grannie no trouble while I am gone." Then Joyce turned for a moment into
LINE 95: the pretty sitting room which Mrs. Arundel occupied. Since Gratian's
LINE 96: marriage she had lived with her son and his wife. She had separate rooms
LINE 97: on the upper floor of the large house, and her own maid. The arrangement
LINE 98: was perfectly harmonious, and the little household was very happy.
LINE 99: "You will not mind letting the children dine with you, dear Grannie?"
LINE 100: Joyce said.
LINE 101: "Mind! it will be a great treat; do not hasten back."
LINE 102: "I thought after dinner, if Piers liked, we would go and see Mrs. More;
LINE 103: he does not get out enough."
LINE 104: "Take a carriage at my expense, dear, and drive to Windsor terrace, and
LINE 105: then over the Downs. It will be a lovely afternoon, and your mother will
LINE 106: enjoy it."
LINE 107: Joyce shook her head.
LINE 108: "I doubt if mother will come; but I will do my best, thank you. Gilbert
LINE 109: will not come home till quite a late dinner--supper, as my mother calls
LINE 110: all meals after six o'clock."
LINE 111: Joyce and Charlotte were soon walking quickly up Park Street, for their
LINE 112: lungs were good and their limbs strong, and Charlotte forgot her
LINE 113: complaints for the time, in the delight of looking in at several shop
LINE 114: windows lately opened in Park Street.
LINE 115: There was no Triangle then. The Victoria Rooms were only a dream of some
LINE 116: enterprising builder, and it was across a field that Joyce made her way,
LINE 117: till she came to the sombre houses with dark, sunless frontage called
LINE 118: Rodney Place, and, passing them and the stately mansion, Manilla Hall,
LINE 119: she turned towards some low grey-coloured houses, which rejoiced in the
LINE 120: name of "Down Cottages."
LINE 121: It was impossible for Mrs. Falconer to live in any house without leaving
LINE 122: her mark upon it, and the little dining and drawing rooms were as bright
LINE 123: and fresh as she could make them, while Piers had the third sitting room
LINE 124: for his "rubbish."
LINE 125: Piers had now a collection of birds and beasts which had grown into
LINE 126: large proportions since the little sparrow-hawk had been "set up" by Mr.
LINE 127: Plume.
LINE 128: He had studied natural history in all its branches, and since he had
LINE 129: lived in Clifton he had begun to be an earnest student of the great
LINE 130: subject of geology, and his light figure, leaning on his crutches, and
LINE 131: his pale, earnest face, were familiar to those who took their daily
LINE 132: airing on the Observatory Hill. Piers had made friends with the stone
LINE 133: cutters who spread out their stalls on Sion Hill and at the foot of the
LINE 134: Observatory, and there was a continual interest in getting specimens
LINE 135: from them.
LINE 136: Piers was helped in his studies by a young physician, who was then
LINE 137: putting his foot on the first rung of the ladder which he soon scaled to
LINE 138: the very top, and stood in later years pre-eminently as the first
LINE 139: consulting physician of the West of England. His patients at this time,
LINE 140: above the level of Park Street were not very numerous, and he would
LINE 141: laughingly assure Piers that he was very proud to attend any one in so
LINE 142: aristocratic a locality as Down Cottage!
LINE 143: He lent Piers books and instruments, and gave him a microscope, of
LINE 144: which, as a physician, he had several, and, indeed, was the bright
LINE 145: element in the lame boy's life.
LINE 146: He was coming out of the house now as Joyce opened the little iron gate,
LINE 147: his horse waiting for him at the corner.
LINE 148: The greeting between the doctor and Joyce was unusually warm; he admired
LINE 149: her beautiful, beaming face, and always liked to exchange a word with
LINE 150: her.
LINE 151: "It is great news," he said; "though the crucial test is yet to come."
LINE 152: "Yes," Joyce said; "but surely the dear old Lords will not obstruct the
LINE 153: bill."
LINE 154: "The dear old Bishops will do so," the doctor said, "your friend at
LINE 155: Wells amongst them."
LINE 156: "Well," Joyce said, "he is sure to do what he does because he thinks it
LINE 157: is right, not because other people do it."
LINE 158: The doctor laughed again; evidently he was not so sure of the Bishop.
LINE 159: Then, with a pleasant smile to Charlotte, the doctor went away, just
LINE 160: turning back for a moment to say, "I saw your old friend, Mrs. Hannah
LINE 161: More's doctor, in consultation this morning, and he incidentally
LINE 162: mentioned that she was failing rather visibly. Have you seen her of
LINE 163: late?"
LINE 164: "I am going there this afternoon," Joyce said. "I want so much to see
LINE 165: her."
LINE 166: "I would not delay," the doctor said, significantly, and then he was
LINE 167: gone.
LINE 168: After the first greeting. Piers dragged Joyce off to his den, to show
LINE 169: her a beautiful specimen of quartz, of which he had possessed himself
LINE 170: the day before for a mere trifle.
LINE 171: And then he had diagrams to show her, which he had drawn, of several
LINE 172: crystals, as seen through the microscope; and then he divulged the
LINE 173: doctor's plan, that he should prepare a good many of such diagrams for
LINE 174: him to use at a lecture he was to give in the Bristol Museum, some
LINE 175: evening in the course of the coming winter.
LINE 176: I do not think there is any quality more attractive than that, which
LINE 177: Joyce possessed in a remarkable degree, of throwing herself--not
LINE 178: superficially, as Gratian did, but really and heartily--into the
LINE 179: interests of other people.
LINE 180: [Illustration: Clifton and the Avon.]
LINE 181: Any one watching her face as she bent over Piers' treasures, and
LINE 182: examined his drawings, would have scarcely believed that she was the
LINE 183: mother of four children, to whom she was devoted.
LINE 184: Piers was seated at his table, and she was standing over him, with one
LINE 185: hand upon his shoulder, while, with the other, she now and then stroked
LINE 186: back his hair, as in old days.
LINE 187: It is strange to think how the quiet, happy life of home, and home
LINE 188: interests may go on, while the storm of political strife, and religious
LINE 189: controversy rages without. It was thus with Sir Thomas Browne, the
LINE 190: philosopher and physician, of Norwich, who produced his great work, the
LINE 191: "Religio Medici," when England stood on the eve of the greatest storm,
LINE 192: which ever burst over her. It was thus with many less distinguished and
LINE 193: simple souls, who went about their accustomed duties and pleasures, and
LINE 194: took up their daily burden of cares and toil, and gave but little heed
LINE 195: to the jarring elements without.
LINE 196: Presently Joyce said: "I must go to mother now and get ready for dinner.
LINE 197: How has mother been lately?"
LINE 198: "Oh! very well," Piers said. "She does not _care_ very much for
LINE 199: anything, that is the worst of it. She always talks of her day being
LINE 200: over, and that she has nothing now to live for; but she has, all the
LINE 201: same," Piers continued, laughing. "She bustles about every morning,
LINE 202: rubbing and dusting, and then she is knitting socks enough to last
LINE 203: Falcon till he is twenty, and all kinds of things for your baby."
LINE 204: "Does she get on with the servants now?"
LINE 205: "Oh! pretty well. Of course, there is a good scold every day of one or
LINE 206: the other of them, but both the maids know by this time, as we all do,
LINE 207: that mother's bark may be sharp, but her bite is nothing."
LINE 208: "I hope you are not very dull, darling Piers?" Joyce asked.
LINE 209: "Dull! No, thank goodness! I don't know what dullness means. I see you
LINE 210: have brought Charlotte with you; she is as languishing as ever."
LINE 211: "Poor Charlotte!" Joyce said; "she, at any rate, knows very well what
LINE 212: dullness means. But I must not stay; remember you and mother are to
LINE 213: spend Christmas with us in Great George Street."
LINE 214: The Clifton of fifty-five year's ago might not present such an
LINE 215: appearance of gaiety on a fine afternoon as it does now; but,
LINE 216: nevertheless, the Downs and Observatory were sprinkled with people, well
LINE 217: dressed, in carriages, or Bath chairs, or on foot.
LINE 218: It was decided that the carriage should be ordered by Joyce from the
LINE 219: stables at the back of Sion Hill, as she went to Windsor Terrace; that
LINE 220: Mrs. Falconer, Piers, and Charlotte should drive to the turnpike on the
LINE 221: Down, and then come to the top of Granby Hill, and wait there for Joyce.
LINE 222: Charlotte was quite content with this arrangement, and watched Joyce's
LINE 223: departure after dinner with some satisfaction. She rather liked to be
LINE 224: alone with Mrs. Falconer, who, as she knitted, listened to her little
LINE 225: complaints with patience, if not with expressed sympathy. Mrs. Arundel,
LINE 226: on the contrary, thought Charlotte needed rousing, and was intolerant of
LINE 227: perpetual headaches and low spirits.
LINE 228: There were many unoccupied young women like Charlotte, fifty years ago,
LINE 229: without any particular aim in life, except a vague idea that they ought
LINE 230: to be married. The years as they passed, often went by on leaden wings.
LINE 231: Charlotte was amiable and gentle; and Miss Falconer, disappointed with
LINE 232: the result of her training, would say: "Poor dear Charlotte has not
LINE 233: strong health; so different from Joyce, who was a perfect rustic in
LINE 234: that, as in other things." But Joyce was married, and Charlotte remained
LINE 235: single, and had not even the satisfaction of recounting her many
LINE 236: conquests, as her aunt so frequently did.
LINE 237: There is no more honourable and noble life than that of the single woman
LINE 238: who bravely takes up her lot, and works her way to independence, by
LINE 239: industry and the cultivation of the gifts God has given her, for which
LINE 240: the opportunities in these days are so many. But there is--I had almost
LINE 241: said _was_--no life more pitiable, than that of the woman whose youth is
LINE 242: passing, and who, having to accept her position as unmarried, does so
LINE 243: with a bad grace, and pines for what, by her very melancholy views of
LINE 244: life, she puts more and more beyond her reach, and who is perpetually
LINE 245: thinking of her own little pains and troubles, and forgets to be at
LINE 246: leisure from herself, to sympathise with those of others.
LINE 247: "Joyce did not ask _me_ to go and see Mrs. More; though we stayed at
LINE 248: Barley Wood together," Charlotte was saying. "However, I dare say Mrs.
LINE 249: More would not remember me."
LINE 250: "Her memory is getting short now," said Mrs. Falconer; "she reaped a
LINE 251: pretty harvest for her over-indulgence of her servants; teaching them
LINE 252: things that were above their station in life was the beginning of it.
LINE 253: They cheated her through thick and thin, and some gentlemen had to
LINE 254: interfere, and break up the household for her, poor old lady!"
LINE 255: "It must be a change for her to live in Windsor Terrace, after that
LINE 256: lovely place," Charlotte said.
LINE 257: "Not greater than for me to change Fair Acres for Down Cottage; but my
LINE 258: day is over, and it suits me very well, and Piers is happy, while Harry
LINE 259: and Ralph like to come here sometimes, and I like to be near Joyce and
LINE 260: the dear children."
LINE 261: "I think Falcon is rather tiresome and noisy," Charlotte said. "Joyce
LINE 262: does not reprove him as she ought."
LINE 263: Mrs. Falconer was touchy about her grand-children; in her eyes Falcon
LINE 264: was perfect, and the love that had been so unsparingly poured forth on
LINE 265: Melville, was now given to Falcon.
LINE 266: "He's a noble boy," she said, in a tone that implied it was certainly
LINE 267: not Charlotte's business to suggest that he had any imperfections. And
LINE 268: now the knitting-needles were laid aside, for the carriage stopped at
LINE 269: the little iron gate, and Mrs. Falconer went to call Piers, and to
LINE 270: prepare for her drive.
LINE 271: Meantime Joyce had gone down the steep hill to Windsor Terrace, and,
LINE 272: after some hesitation on the part of Miss Frowde, she was allowed to see
LINE 273: Mrs. More.
LINE 274: She was seated in an easy chair, propped up with cushions, enjoying the
LINE 275: view which lay before her.
LINE 276: For a moment she sought Joyce's face with an inquiring glance, as if not
LINE 277: quite sure of her identity; but almost immediately the recognition came,
LINE 278: and she greeted her, with one of her brightest smiles.
LINE 279: "Why, my dear Mrs. Arundel, you are quite a stranger. How are the dear
LINE 280: babies, and poor Susan?"
LINE 281: "They are all well, dear madam, and Susan is an increasingly valuable
LINE 282: servant."
LINE 283: "I am glad to hear it. I love to know that the seed sown is springing
LINE 284: up. We are sadly impatient, my dear; we are like children pulling up the
LINE 285: plant to see if the roots are grown. How are things going on at Fair
LINE 286: Acres?"
LINE 287: "Very much as usual. My brother Ralph manages the estate."
LINE 288: "And the others look on! Well, well, patience is the great lesson for us
LINE 289: all to learn, the patience that God has with us. Prayer and patient
LINE 290: waiting will move mountains at last."
LINE 291: Then, after a few more inquiries, Mrs. More came to public matters.
LINE 292: "I thought," she said, "I was too old to take such a deep interest in
LINE 293: the affairs of this kingdom and this city; but, my dear, we stand on the
LINE 294: edge of a volcano, and, from all I hear, Bristol is ill-prepared. There
LINE 295: is a growing feeling of hatred against the magistrates, and the zeal of
LINE 296: Sir Charles Wetherall has carried him beyond the bounds of discretion.
LINE 297: Would you like to borrow any books? They are at your service. In that
LINE 298: book-case there are many volumes written by me. I often sit here, and
LINE 299: think over the writing of those books, and how little I ever expected
LINE 300: that they would have a large sale, and bring me in, as they did, thirty
LINE 301: thousand pounds. It often fills me with self-abasement, not
LINE 302: self-glorification."
LINE 303: "I will not take a book to-day, dear madam; and here is Miss Frowde come
LINE 304: to warn me that I have stayed long enough."
LINE 305: "See!" Mrs. More said, "there is the little steam-packet puffing busily
LINE 306: up the river. I am blessed in my old age, to see before my windows the
LINE 307: two great discoveries of the age, steam-power made useful for
LINE 308: locomotion, and coal-gas for light. I am very happy here, my dear, but
LINE 309: remember an old woman's advice, and do not spoil Susan Priday, or any
LINE 310: servant, by over indulgence. Very often, as in my own case,
LINE 311: carelessness, and dislike of trouble is the real root of the evil. God
LINE 312: bless you and keep you, my dear," she said, as Joyce bent to kiss her.
LINE 313: "Is there much excitement abroad about the passing of the Reform Bill?"
LINE 314: "Not that I have seen," Joyce answered; "but I daresay there may be in
LINE 315: the city."
LINE 316: "Well, the result is in God's hands; we must pray and labour for peace,
LINE 317: that blessed gift of God's love--peace."
LINE 318: It was a sweet parting word, and one to which Joyce often recurred in
LINE 319: later years, almost as Hannah More's legacy to her--Peace.
LINE 320: [Illustration]
