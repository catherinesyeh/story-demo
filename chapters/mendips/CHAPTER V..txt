LINE 1: SUNDAY AT FAIR ACRES.
LINE 2: The boys, perhaps excepting Ralph and Piers, were invariably more
LINE 3: turbulent on Sunday than any other day of the week. There was an attempt
LINE 4: made by their mother to enforce discipline on Sunday, from the same
LINE 5: reason which made her scrupulous in attending church regularly. Besides,
LINE 6: the boys' best Sunday jackets and long tight trousers were in peril, if
LINE 7: their usual habits of tree-climbing and birds' egg hunting were not laid
LINE 8: aside with their week-day garments.
LINE 9: The large Sunday dinner at one o'clock was always lengthened out to its
LINE 10: utmost limit, but when that was over, the time hung heavy on hand.
LINE 11: A smart box on Bunny's ear, administered by Melville, with a hand on
LINE 12: which a huge ring glistened, and which left a pretty deep triangular cut
LINE 13: on the boy's ear, roused Piers' indignation.
LINE 14: "You coward," he said; "just because he trod on your smart shoe. I would
LINE 15: not wear such a shoe for a hundred pounds."
LINE 16: "You are not very likely to be tried," was Melville's rejoinder. "Your
LINE 17: feet are not made for shoes with buckles."
LINE 18: "Oh! Melville," Joyce exclaimed, "how can you be so unkind?" while his
LINE 19: father said, in a stern voice, "If you have no brains, sir, I always
LINE 20: thought you had a heart."
LINE 21: Mrs. Falconer was rising to follow Bunny, whose loud crying was heard in
LINE 22: the hall; but Joyce said:
LINE 23: "Mother, let me go. I had better take all the boys away, mother, and
LINE 24: amuse them, if I can. I don't think Bunny need cry like that, though it
LINE 25: was too bad to hit him."
LINE 26: "It was indeed," Gilbert Arundel could not help exclaiming fervently,
LINE 27: though like all guests in a house, when family disputes are going on, he
LINE 28: felt it difficult to know whether to speak or be silent.
LINE 29: "I hate Melville," Piers said fiercely, as he swung himself out of the
LINE 30: room after his sister.
LINE 31: Joyce soon persuaded Bunny that he was not much hurt, and said if they
LINE 32: would all come up to the seat under the fir-tree she would read to them.
LINE 33: The boys willingly consented, and Joyce ran upstairs and fetched the
LINE 34: pretty Bible, bound in purple, with its gilt leaves, which she displayed
LINE 35: to her admiring brothers.
LINE 36: "But you are not going to read _that_, Joyce," Piers said. "Isn't it
LINE 37: dull? Can't you find the Pilgrim's Progress?"
LINE 38: "Yes," exclaimed Harry; "I like the Giant Despair part, and the history
LINE 39: of all the bones and skulls lying about."
LINE 40: "I will read about a giant," Joyce said, "a very pretty story from the
LINE 41: Bible."
LINE 42: "Oh! I know," said Ralph; "very well, I don't mind hearing it again."
LINE 43: Joyce seated herself with her brothers round her, and read the familiar
LINE 44: Bible story, with a somewhat slow utterance, but with so much dramatic
LINE 45: power in the tones of her voice that her listeners were profoundly
LINE 46: attentive. Then she talked to them about David, and said she had read
LINE 47: that the story was a type of the great battle we had all to fight
LINE 48: against the giant of self. She did not know that she had another
LINE 49: listener till her brothers had dispersed, and she was left on the seat
LINE 50: with the Bible in her hand. Then Mr. Arundel came through the little
LINE 51: gate leading from the copse, and looking up at Joyce, said:
LINE 52: "May I come nearer?"
LINE 53: Joyce started to her feet.
LINE 54: "Take care," she said; "the grass is very dry and slippery;" and as
LINE 55: Gilbert Arundel made a rather scrambling ascent, Joyce advanced and
LINE 56: held out her hand to him to help him up the last few yards.
LINE 57: "I have been in hiding behind that tree by the gate," he said; "I did
LINE 58: not like to disturb the boys by my presence, after the pains you had
LINE 59: taken to keep them quiet."
LINE 60: Joyce's colour rose, and she said:
LINE 61: "I would rather you had let me know you were listening, especially when
LINE 62: I was talking to the boys."
LINE 63: "Do not be vexed with me," Mr. Arundel said. "I am so glad to have found
LINE 64: you here alone."
LINE 65: "I wanted to speak to you, too," she said, quickly, "about my brother;
LINE 66: he is"--she stopped, and then went on; "I think I may say it to you--he
LINE 67: is the one cloud over our happy life here at Fair Acres. It used not to
LINE 68: be so; he was very different once."
LINE 69: "Yes," Mr. Arundel said, "I can quite imagine it was so. Your brother is
LINE 70: very weak of purpose, and he got into a bad set at the university where
LINE 71: I found him."
LINE 72: "What made you care for him?" Joyce said, simply; "you are so different
LINE 73: from him."
LINE 74: "Well, the story is rather a long one, and I do not know that all of it
LINE 75: is fit for your ears, or that I ought to inflict it upon you. Still I
LINE 76: think you should know something about it. I feel an interest in poor
LINE 77: Melville much the same interest which a man takes in anything that has
LINE 78: cost him some trouble."
LINE 79: "What made you take any trouble about him?" Joyce asked.
LINE 80: "I scarcely know; pity, I think, began it; and who could help pitying
LINE 81: him? He got into the hands of an unprincipled man, much older than
LINE 82: himself, who is, in fact, a relative of mine, and I did what I could to
LINE 83: get him out of his clutches. He got all his money out of him, and then
LINE 84: persuaded him to gamble to get more; of course ending in losing it."
LINE 85: "How dreadful!" Joyce exclaimed. "Does father know?"
LINE 86: "He knows about the money part, of course; about the debts and
LINE 87: difficulties."
LINE 88: "Yes," Joyce exclaimed, with a sigh, "and it has troubled him greatly."
LINE 89: "What I wanted to say to you was, that I think if Melville went abroad,
LINE 90: as he wishes, it might be a good thing, provided a safe companion could
LINE 91: be found for him."
LINE 92: "Will you go?" Joyce said, eagerly.
LINE 93: "No, it is impossible; I could not leave my mother: I am all she has in
LINE 94: the world. We are going to live in Bristol, where I am to be articled to
LINE 95: a good firm of lawyers, and perhaps I may study afterwards for the
LINE 96: bar."
LINE 97: "I thought you were of high family," Joyce said innocently.
LINE 98: "Would that prevent my taking to law?" Gilbert asked, with a smile.
LINE 99: "No; I don't know exactly why it should do so," she said. "Melville
LINE 100: talks so much about things which are right for a gentleman to do, and
LINE 101: things which a gentleman cannot do; and then he dresses so fashionably,
LINE 102: and people remark upon it."
LINE 103: "I don't wonder," Gilbert said, laughing; "but that part of his
LINE 104: proceedings is only laughable. Many men are fops in their youth who tone
LINE 105: down wonderfully when they get old. Let us hope it will be so with him."
LINE 106: "You know," Joyce said, "that Melville ought to spare father expenses
LINE 107: instead of adding to them. There have been two bad harvests and hard
LINE 108: winters, and Mr. Watson, the steward, is getting rather past his work.
LINE 109: Melville ought to take that place now, and save father, for there is
LINE 110: Ralph to be educated, and he ought to have the _best_, for he is so
LINE 111: studious; and then there are the three other boys, and poor Piers is
LINE 112: lame, and they all want something."
LINE 113: "You don't seem to want anything yourself," Mr. Arundel said.
LINE 114: "No: I have a happy home and everything is beautiful about me. What
LINE 115: _can_ I want?"
LINE 116: "Not to go to London, or Bath, or to see the world?" he asked.
LINE 117: "I think," said Joyce, simply, "if it came in my way--I mean if there
LINE 118: was plenty of money--I should like to travel a little. Can you believe
LINE 119: that I have only been to Bath once and to Bristol twice in my life? and
LINE 120: I am nearly eighteen. My Cousin Charlotte, who lives at Wells with my
LINE 121: aunt, has been to school in Bath, but father never wished me to go to
LINE 122: school, so I have no accomplishments. But I need not talk any more about
LINE 123: myself, it cannot be interesting."
LINE 124: Gilbert Arundel was beginning a speech to the effect that what she said
LINE 125: was most interesting to him, but somehow it died away on his lips. The
LINE 126: sweet earnestness of the face which he had been watching while she
LINE 127: spoke, the entire absence of self-consciousness, seemed to lift her
LINE 128: above the level of compliments or flattery, which the gentlemen of the
LINE 129: time considered the rightful inheritance of the young ladies, with whom
LINE 130: they trifled for an hour's amusement.
LINE 131: As she sat with her face towards the beautiful landscape over which the
LINE 132: westering sun was casting its level rays, she seemed so far above him
LINE 133: and bearing the "lily in her hand" of which a poet of later days than
LINE 134: those in which Joyce lived has said that--
LINE 135: "Gates of brass cannot withstand
LINE 136: One touch of that enchanted wand."
LINE 137: The silence which fell over Gilbert was unbroken for a few minutes by
LINE 138: any word on either side. At last Joyce said:
LINE 139: "Is there anything I can do for Melville? He has rather a way of looking
LINE 140: down on me, and I think I speak crossly to him sometimes. I wish you
LINE 141: would tell me if you think I could help father about him."
LINE 142: "If he does not listen to _you_ I should think it hopeless that he would
LINE 143: listen to anyone," Gilbert said; "he has a way of looking down on most
LINE 144: people."
LINE 145: "Not on _you_?" Joyce said, with a little innocent laugh. "He made us
LINE 146: think you were very grand and that we must alter all our ways to suit
LINE 147: you; poor mother was to change the hours for meals, and----"
LINE 148: "I never heard such nonsense," Gilbert said; "but I know where he got
LINE 149: those notions from, and I may tell you this much, that the kindest thing
LINE 150: you can do is to ask your father, to consent to his going abroad for a
LINE 151: year as soon as may be; he will be out of harm's way. I have had some
LINE 152: fears that the person who had such an evil influence over him might
LINE 153: follow him here, and I was determined to circumvent him."
LINE 154: "It was very kind of you to take this trouble. Who is the person?"
LINE 155: "He is a step-uncle of mine; my mother's half-brother, Lord Maythorne."
LINE 156: "Quite a grand person, then?" Joyce said.
LINE 157: "Grand in his own eyes; yes, undoubtedly; but there is every hope that,
LINE 158: having got what he can out of Melville, he will leave him alone. You do
LINE 159: not know how ashamed I am to own him as a relation; and I am anxious to
LINE 160: do all I can to atone for the mischief he may have done your brother."
LINE 161: "Was he at Oxford with Melville?"
LINE 162: "No: but, unhappily, he has a small place near Oxford, and was
LINE 163: continually coming in."
LINE 164: "Shall I tell father all about what you have told me?"
LINE 165: "I have told him already a good deal. What I want you to do is to use
LINE 166: every effort to persuade your father to let Melville start soon."
LINE 167: "It would be far better if I could persuade Melville to stay here, and
LINE 168: learn about farming."
LINE 169: "Yes; but that, I am afraid, you will never do; and considering that
LINE 170: your father wished him to work on the estate it was a mistake to send
LINE 171: him to Oxford at all."
LINE 172: "Oh, yes; but it was mother's wish, you know," Joyce said, with a
LINE 173: heightened colour. "Mother always feels that her family was not
LINE 174: considered as good as father's; they were simple, homely, good people,
LINE 175: but not what are called gentry, and I think it has always been mother's
LINE 176: desire that Melville should have exactly the same advantages as the sons
LINE 177: of our neighbours. Charlie Paget went to Oxford; they live at Ebbor
LINE 178: Court; and so it seemed her eldest son ought to go. It is so strange
LINE 179: that mother should be quite consistent on every subject but one, and
LINE 180: that one, the indulgence of Melville; and now I believe he will break
LINE 181: her heart."
LINE 182: "No, no, I trust not so bad as that," Mr. Arundel said. "I have hopes
LINE 183: that there will be a change for the better, and all this folly and aping
LINE 184: his betters will drop off like an old cloak one day."
LINE 185: Joyce sighed.
LINE 186: "I wish I could have hopes too; there is always, I suppose, some cloud
LINE 187: in everyone's sky; and we are so happy, that if it were not for
LINE 188: Melville, we should have all we wished for. Yesterday in the hay-field I
LINE 189: felt as if even to be alive was delicious, everything was so bright and
LINE 190: joyful. Then Mrs. Hannah More came and invited me to Barley Wood. Have
LINE 191: you heard of Mrs. More?"
LINE 192: "Yes, I think I have. A very good old lady, who has set up schools for
LINE 193: the poor children. My mother knows all about her. Will you like going to
LINE 194: Barley Hill?"
LINE 195: "Barley Wood," Joyce corrected. "Yes, I think I shall. Charlotte is to
LINE 196: come also; and I dare say I shall like it when I am there, and it may do
LINE 197: me good. You know Aunt Letitia always calls me 'a little rustic.' Of
LINE 198: course I _am_, but I do not know that it is of such great consequence as
LINE 199: Aunt Letitia thinks."
LINE 200: "It would be a pity, indeed, if you were anything but what you are,"
LINE 201: Gilbert said earnestly. "A change could hardly be an improvement."
LINE 202: "Oh, do not say that," Joyce said. "I want to _know_ more, and though I
LINE 203: read everything I can in father's library, I do not get any new books.
LINE 204: Ralph helps me with Latin, and Piers and I learn French together, though
LINE 205: I expect our pronunciation would make you laugh. We have just read
LINE 206: Madame de Stael's 'Corinne' and a story called 'Matilde,' which
LINE 207: Charlotte lent me. Is not Piers wonderful?" she asked; "he is so happy,
LINE 208: and have you seen his collection of moths and butterflies? You must come
LINE 209: into his room and see them."
LINE 210: "Yes, I should like to do so very much, if you will be showwoman."
LINE 211: He liked to hear her talk of her simple home pleasures and interests; he
LINE 212: liked to watch the ever-changing expression of her lovely face; he felt
LINE 213: within himself that this hour on the hill-side, was to remain a bright
LINE 214: memory with him for many a day, to which he would recur with pleasure,
LINE 215: and over which no cloud could come.
LINE 216: At last the sound of the boys' voices in the copse below, roused them
LINE 217: both from their earnest talk, and Joyce's name rang through the still
LINE 218: summer air--
LINE 219: "Joyce! Joyce! tea has been ready ever so long. Mother does not like
LINE 220: waiting. Do come!"
LINE 221: "Yes, pray come, Joyce; there is no one to pour out tea, or cut the
LINE 222: cake. Mother says you ought not to have put sugar on the cake," said
LINE 223: Bunny. "I am so glad you did."
LINE 224: Joyce flew swiftly down through the wood, and by the time Mr. Arundel
LINE 225: and her brothers had reached the house, she was at her post behind the
LINE 226: large bronze urn, and taking up her accustomed duties with a face so
LINE 227: bright and winning, that her mother forgot her vexation, merely saying:
LINE 228: "I like punctuality at meals, Joyce, especially on Sunday; for it puts
LINE 229: the servants out if they are driven."
LINE 230: "Why, my Sunshine," her father said, "where have you been hiding? We
LINE 231: thought you were lost."
LINE 232: "Joyce has been sitting under the fir-tree with Mr. Arundel," shouted
LINE 233: Bunny in his ringing, boyish treble. "They have been there two hours."
LINE 234: Bunny was in advance of the other boys and their guest; and it was Piers
LINE 235: who said: "You need not shout as if you were the town-crier!" While
LINE 236: Melville dragged himself out of the depths of a large sofa covered with
LINE 237: horse-hair, where he had been sleeping off the effects of his large
LINE 238: dinner and repeated glasses of ale and wine, and said the boys' voices
LINE 239: were a perfect nuisance, and he did not know what Arundel thought of
LINE 240: such a hubbub.
LINE 241: A laugh from the person in question, as he passed the open window with
LINE 242: Ralph, seemed to point to the fact that Gilbert had as light a heart as
LINE 243: any of the young brothers at whom Melville so often took offence.
LINE 244: Family prayers were the exception in many households in these days; but
LINE 245: as there was only one service in the church on Sundays, the squire,
LINE 246: following his father's custom before him, always assembled the household
LINE 247: in the evening, and read a chapter from the old family Bible, and a
LINE 248: short dry sermon with a prayer from an old book, in which was written
LINE 249: his mother's name. It might be questioned whether the rosy-cheeked
LINE 250: maiden and the stalwart young men from the Farm, who sat with their
LINE 251: hands one on each knee, staring at Melville and the visitor, as strange
LINE 252: specimens of humanity, could understand a word of the sermon or follow
LINE 253: the prayer.
LINE 254: Perhaps Joyce scarcely realised how dry and formal this service was, and
LINE 255: yet this evening a new spirit seemed to be stirring within her, an
LINE 256: aspiration for something, she hardly knew what, but something which was
LINE 257: not outside of her, but touched her inmost heart.
LINE 258: Her mood was subdued and quiet during the rest of the evening, and when
LINE 259: she knocked at Piers' door to be admitted, as was her invariable custom,
LINE 260: to make his room tidy, and place his crutches near the bed, the boy
LINE 261: said:
LINE 262: "Do you like Mr. Arundel, Joyce?"
LINE 263: "Yes, dear; I think I like him very much."
LINE 264: Piers was silent.
LINE 265: "The next thing will be that you like him better than me."
LINE 266: "Nonsense, Piers; is that likely?"
LINE 267: Joyce had finished her labours in the little room now, and had seated
LINE 268: herself in the window-seat looking out into the grounds.
LINE 269: The moon, nearly at the full, was lifting her round, white face above
LINE 270: the low-lying range of hills eastward while the colour of the sunset sky
LINE 271: still lingered in the west.
LINE 272: The window was open, and from below Joyce heard the sound of her
LINE 273: father's voice and Mr. Arundel's. She knew what they were talking about,
LINE 274: and she said:
LINE 275: "Of course I like Mr. Arundel, who is so good about Melville, and came
LINE 276: here solely to try to be of use to him: very few people would have taken
LINE 277: that trouble."
LINE 278: Piers gave a low rejoinder, which might be taken for consent.
LINE 279: "He says, Piers, a man he knows has a bad influence over Melville, and
LINE 280: that he is a relation of his, and that he thinks Melville ought to be
LINE 281: sent abroad."
LINE 282: "To do just what he likes, as he always does," was Piers' rejoinder. "It
LINE 283: is a shame that Melville should bring so much trouble on us."
LINE 284: "Yes, it does seem a shame," Joyce said; and then she went to the bed,
LINE 285: and, kneeling down, kissed Piers' hand as it lay upon the counterpane.
LINE 286: "I felt so sorry for you this afternoon, dear," she said. "It gave me a
LINE 287: great pain to hear Melville speak as he did to you."
LINE 288: "Never mind, Joy, never mind. What does it matter?" And the boy stroked
LINE 289: his sister's hair fondly. "I don't mind; I would rather have my crooked,
LINE 290: helpless legs than be like _him_. Yes, I really would," he repeated.
LINE 291: "But Joyce, don't begin to care for any one more than me; that is what I
LINE 292: dread."
LINE 293: "You foolish boy," she answered; "as if I could care for any one as I do
LINE 294: for you! And when I come back from Mrs. More's I shall have so much to
LINE 295: tell you; and I may get some nice books there, which we will read
LINE 296: together."
LINE 297: Piers turned suddenly and threw his arms round his sister's neck. He was
LINE 298: not usually demonstrative, but he said, with passionate energy, "While I
LINE 299: have you, Joy, I can bear anything. Good-night."
LINE 300: "Good-night, dear; and never take foolish fancies into your head. You
LINE 301: may be sure I shall always love you and be all I can to you.
LINE 302: Good-night."
LINE 303: There is no doubt that a protecting maternal element in the love of a
LINE 304: sister for a brother makes the tie one of the most beautiful that
LINE 305: exists. From the time of Piers' accident Joyce had constituted herself
LINE 306: his helper and friend. Mrs. Falconer in her busy life could not devote
LINE 307: herself to her crippled boy, as mothers of a less energetic and active
LINE 308: nature might have done.
LINE 309: Joyce and she had it is true one aim in common: to hide from the father
LINE 310: the sad consequences of that one rash act which had shut Piers out for
LINE 311: ever from the free, joyous life of his young vigorous brothers. Mrs.
LINE 312: Falconer did this by apparently making light of her boy's ailments, and
LINE 313: inability to do what others did.
LINE 314: It was a good thing, she would say, that he could not climb trees and
LINE 315: tear his clothes, or get into the stream by Wookey and ruin his boots
LINE 316: and socks, or make her anxious by carrying a gun behind his father, in
LINE 317: the time of rabbit and rook shooting.
LINE 318: Mrs. Falconer never betrayed what was indeed the truth, that the sound
LINE 319: of Piers' crutches as they tapped across the old stone pavement of the
LINE 320: hall, sent a thrill of sorrow through her breast, and that when Piers
LINE 321: was laid up, as was not unfrequently the case, with an attack of pain in
LINE 322: the hip which had been so severely injured, she avoided being much with
LINE 323: him, and left him to Joyce, because the sight of his suffering brought
LINE 324: back the memory of that morning when she saw him clinging with a
LINE 325: frightened face to Rioter's back, and heard her husband say, "Don't make
LINE 326: a coward of the boy: his brothers rode long before his age."
LINE 327: She knew too well how bitter had been her husband's self-reproaches,
LINE 328: and she dreaded adding to them by any impulsive, unguarded word of her
LINE 329: own.
LINE 330: Thus it was that Joyce was sister, mother, and friend to her lame
LINE 331: brother. Their lives were bound up together, and the bond strengthened
LINE 332: as time went on.
LINE 333: It was sufficient reward for Joyce to know that, however irritable when
LINE 334: in pain, or depressed sometimes by a sudden reminder of his helplessness
LINE 335: when contrasted with his brother's independence and vigour, she could
LINE 336: always be sufficient to charm away the cloud by her own sunny
LINE 337: brightness, and that by making his interests hers, she never let him
LINE 338: think she did anything for him, which was not a real pleasure to
LINE 339: herself.
LINE 340: The secret of heart service lies in this, that those who are served
LINE 341: never know it to its full extent, and that any effort that may be made,
LINE 342: or any trouble that may be taken, is so hidden under the mantle of
LINE 343: all-pervading love that it is often wholly unsuspected. When the giver
LINE 344: is as happy as the receiver, the gift, in whatever form, is sweetened
LINE 345: and enhanced a hundred fold.
