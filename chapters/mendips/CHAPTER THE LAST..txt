LINE 1: AT ABBOT'S LEIGH.
LINE 2: The old year, which had been so full of trouble and sorrow, was passing
LINE 3: gently away in calm and unusual brightness.
LINE 4: The air was soft and balmy, and the sunshine lay upon the picturesque
LINE 5: village of Abbot's Leigh, and threw out every yellow lichen on the red
LINE 6: roofs of the houses, and every leafless branch of the trees in full
LINE 7: brightness and defined outline.
LINE 8: The year was full of grace and beauty on this its last day; and Gilbert
LINE 9: Arundel, walking up and down the sunny terrace path before his house, on
LINE 10: the left of the road leading to the church, felt the pleasant sense of
LINE 11: returning strength and health, which is always so sweet.
LINE 12: The garden was at the back of the house, and before him lay a goodly
LINE 13: prospect. The lowlands, sloping down to the mouth of the Severn, were
LINE 14: bathed in the sunshine, and beyond, in clear outline, was the great
LINE 15: encircling range of blue mountains on the opposite coast of Wales. In
LINE 16: the clear atmosphere of the winter morning, everything was distinctly
LINE 17: seen. The wooded headland of Portishead shot out to the left, and was
LINE 18: rounded at full tide by many ships, outward bound for the rolling waters
LINE 19: of the Atlantic.
LINE 20: Snowy gulls dipped and whirled on airy flight near the shore, and small
LINE 21: crafts, with all sails set, danced and curtseyed beneath them as they
LINE 22: made for the harbour.
LINE 23: "It is a place to rest and get well in," Gilbert thought; and then he
LINE 24: turned at the sound of footsteps.
LINE 25: His wife was coming through the maze of deep-set, box-bordered
LINE 26: flower-beds to speak to him.
LINE 27: "Mother and Piers will be here early," she said, putting her hand
LINE 28: through her husband's arm; "and Gratian, and Melville, and Ralph will be
LINE 29: later."
LINE 30: "Where are you going to put them all? You forget your country seat is
LINE 31: not as accommodating as our Great George Street house."
LINE 32: "Oh! I will make room," she said; "it is so restful and lovely here. I
LINE 33: wish----"
LINE 34: "What do you wish?"
LINE 35: "That we lived here. I know it is impossible while you are in the office
LINE 36: every day. I only meant it is so delightful to be in the country; winter
LINE 37: or summer, it is the best place."
LINE 38: [Illustration: Abbot's Leigh]
LINE 39: "Few winter days are like this," Gilbert said; "but, darling, one day I
LINE 40: may be able to give you a country home."
LINE 41: "A dear old-fashioned one like _this_?" she said, "Oh! then we will call
LINE 42: it 'The Haven!'"
LINE 43: "It is not built yet," Gilbert said; "we must remember all that the
LINE 44: children will want, education--"
LINE 45: "And accomplishments," she added, laughing. "Lettice, Lota, and little
LINE 46: baby Joy must not grow up 'little rustics.'"
LINE 47: Joyce laughed, just her old, sweet, silvery laugh.
LINE 48: "It answered my purpose to be a little rustic, after all, as I took your
LINE 49: fancy in my lilac cotton gown and white apron."
LINE 50: He put his arm round her as they walked, and pressed her close.
LINE 51: "They might be lovers of yesterday," Susan Priday thought, as she
LINE 52: watched them from the nursery windows, "instead of having been married
LINE 53: seven years. Such love must make a poor man rich and a rich man happy,
LINE 54: and may God bless them both. The mistress grows prettier every day."
LINE 55: No one ever sounded Susan Priday's depth of gratitude; she was not a
LINE 56: demonstrative person, and the other servants, as might be expected, were
LINE 57: a little jealous of her, and sometimes she had dark hints to bear "of
LINE 58: the daughter of bad folks being lucky," and muttered words of
LINE 59: self-congratulation that _their_ fathers had not been rioters and died
LINE 60: in "'ospital beds."
LINE 61: But all these shafts were powerless to disturb Susan's peace, and baby
LINE 62: Joy heard many a soliloquy which reached no other ears than hers.
LINE 63: "Yes," she was saying, as she swayed Joy gently to and fro; "they look
LINE 64: like lovers of yesterday. The master is aged since his illness, and
LINE 65: stoops a bit, but the mistress is younger than ever."
LINE 66: The husband and wife had turned now, and faced the house. Joyce looked
LINE 67: up, and waved her hand and smiled, that "little pure, white hand," Susan
LINE 68: thought, "which poor father said had saved him from despair."
LINE 69: Then the two little girls, in scarlet cloaks and hoods, came with Falcon
LINE 70: to announce that they were ready for a walk with mother, and Gilbert
LINE 71: asked if he might be permitted to come also.
LINE 72: "Of course," Falcon said; "only we thought you might be tired. Mother
LINE 73: told us never to plague you to take us for a walk."
LINE 74: "I am getting quite well, my boy, and it will not be so easy, I hope, to
LINE 75: plague me now as it has been lately."
LINE 76: "I've put away the trumpet, father, where I can't possibly see it, for I
LINE 77: was afraid if I saw it I should be forced to give a big '_too-te-too_.'
LINE 78: So mother said, put it away till father is quite well, and then you can
LINE 79: blow it in the garden. She wanted to _keep_ it for me, but that was like
LINE 80: a baby; now I could get it any minute I wished, only I _won't_."
LINE 81: Gilbert was half amused, half touched, by this lesson of self-restraint
LINE 82: that Joyce had taught her little son, by means of the discordant
LINE 83: trumpet, and he patted his head fondly, saying:
LINE 84: "You'll always be right if you follow mother's advice, my boy."
LINE 85: "I know it," Falcon said; "Susan says mother can make every one
LINE 86: _better_."
LINE 87: Joyce and her little daughters were on in front, walking up the village
LINE 88: to the churchyard.
LINE 89: Presently they retraced their steps to the village, where an old tree,
LINE 90: with a gnarled trunk, stands at the junction of four roads, and was a
LINE 91: favourite post of observation to the children.
LINE 92: A smart post-chaise, seen from afar, coming swiftly onwards, contained
LINE 93: Melville and Gratian. They had slept at an hotel in Clifton on the
LINE 94: previous night, and came in the style which befitted them.
LINE 95: Joyce was a little alarmed at the large amount of boxes on the roof, and
LINE 96: wondered if they could by any means be carried upstairs.
LINE 97: Gratian, handsome and gay as ever, gave all the orders and settled with
LINE 98: the post-boy, while Melville looked on.
LINE 99: It was one of those cases when it is expedient, perhaps, that the wife
LINE 100: should take the lead, from the incapacity of the husband to manage
LINE 101: himself or his affairs, but it has never a pleasing effect on those who
LINE 102: look on, and Gilbert thought how well it was there were no children to
LINE 103: hear Gratian's ringing tones ordering Melville to 'wake up' and carry
LINE 104: two small packages into the hall.
LINE 105: "Where is Ralph?" Joyce asked.
LINE 106: "He took some qualm about leaving Fair Acres. Mr. Watson is ill--dying,
LINE 107: they say--so Ralph said he did not want to leave the place; there are
LINE 108: still many bad characters about."
LINE 109: "I am sorry to miss Ralph, and mother will be disappointed, especially
LINE 110: as Harry has joined his ship."
LINE 111: "What a nice room," Gratian said, as they went upstairs; "but I hope you
LINE 112: have a hanging-closet."
LINE 113: "I am afraid only pegs," Joyce said; "but there is a tiny
LINE 114: dressing-room."
LINE 115: "Is Mrs. Arundel coming to this family gathering?"
LINE 116: "No; mother is in Oxfordshire."
LINE 117: "Staying at Maythorne's; how like Aunt Annabella."
LINE 118: "She is not at Maythorne's you know, it is shut up, for the owners are
LINE 119: gone abroad."
LINE 120: "But I hear another carriage. Yes! that is mother and Piers."
LINE 121: Joyce flew downstairs to greet her mother, and to give Piers a rapturous
LINE 122: embrace.
LINE 123: Everything in the house was well arranged, and especial care had been
LINE 124: bestowed on "mother's room."
LINE 125: Mrs. Falconer had no fine dresses, so she did not enquire for a hanging
LINE 126: cupboard. She speedily found her way to the nursery, and baby Joy
LINE 127: delighted her by holding out her arms to her grannie, with a bewitching
LINE 128: smile.
LINE 129: "It's all beautifully neat, Joyce," she said, looking round her with a
LINE 130: critical air. "Well, you don't regret now I taught you useful things,
LINE 131: though you have no accomplishments like that poor, foolish Charlotte?"
LINE 132: They were a very happy party at an early dinner, and the good
LINE 133: arrangement of everything, and the excellence of the bill of fare,
LINE 134: brought many compliments to Joyce, especially from her mother.
LINE 135: "Except at Fair Acres," she said, "she had never tasted such light
LINE 136: pastry, or such good plum-puddings and mincemeat. The turkey, too----"
LINE 137: "Ah!" Joyce said, "the turkey came with a hamper of good things from
LINE 138: Fair Acres. Dear Ralph is continually despatching home produce."
LINE 139: The real master of Fair Acres did not seem at all discomforted at this
LINE 140: proof of his ignorance of his own estate.
LINE 141: Melville had resigned himself to an easy-going life, and, being well
LINE 142: kept in check by his wife as to unlimited wine and spirits, he managed
LINE 143: to pass muster, and was looked upon by his neighbours as a "good-natured
LINE 144: fellow, a little given to airs, and not worthy to tread in his father's
LINE 145: shoes; but it might have been worse."
LINE 146: Poor praise this; and of how many besides Melville do we say, sometimes
LINE 147: with an aching heart, "It might have been worse; but it might have been
LINE 148: oh! so much better."
LINE 149: Wasted lives, neglected opportunities, withered hopes, how thick they
LINE 150: lie strewn upon our paths as the autumn of life is sinking into the days
LINE 151: of winter barrenness and dearth.
LINE 152: But there is a bright "beyond" for faithful hearts, where the things we
LINE 153: know not now we shall know then, and this bewildering maze of doubts and
LINE 154: fears shall be made plain in the light of God's love.
LINE 155: A certain wistful look in Piers' eyes made Joyce think he would like to
LINE 156: talk to her alone.
LINE 157: So, when the evening shadows were closing over the waters of the Severn,
LINE 158: and the blue mountains fading into obscurity, and the white-winged
LINE 159: seagulls sought their nests, Joyce asked her brother to come out with
LINE 160: her, for it was more like midsummer than Christmas.
LINE 161: Joyce put her arm on her brother's shoulder as of old, and they went
LINE 162: together to the churchyard, where the old grey tower of the church stood
LINE 163: out solemnly against the after-glow in the west, where a planet
LINE 164: shimmered in the opal depths.
LINE 165: "The old year is dying with a smile upon its face," Piers said. "It is
LINE 166: hard to believe we are in midwinter."
LINE 167: "Very hard," Joyce replied; "and it is a time when, though my present is
LINE 168: so happy and so brimful of thanksgiving, the past comes back, and will
LINE 169: not be forgotten."
LINE 170: "I am glad you don't forget the dear old days," Piers said.
LINE 171: "Forget! oh! no; the sadness of the past does not shadow my happy
LINE 172: present, but it chastens it. I always think of dear father when I stand
LINE 173: here, and poor merry, happy Bunny, swept into that surging sea."
LINE 174: "Yes," Piers said, sighing; "the strong are taken and the weakly ones
LINE 175: left. Harry is, I suppose, half way round the world again in the
LINE 176: 'Persis.' There is Ralph working hard and enduring a good deal at the
LINE 177: old home, while I----"
LINE 178: "You are not unhappy, dear?" Joyce asked, anxiously.
LINE 179: "No," he said; but the "No" was not heartily said. "After all, we think
LINE 180: too much of ourselves and all our little concerns. Why, Joyce, what are
LINE 181: we and this earth we live in, when compared to that great universe of
LINE 182: which these stars, as they come out one by one, seem to bring a nightly
LINE 183: message? What are we, to think so much of ourselves? and what are life,
LINE 184: and death, and troubles, and joys, and petty disappointments? They are
LINE 185: nothing--lighter than dust in the balance."
LINE 186: "They are something to God," Joyce said, reverently. "He has told us so.
LINE 187: Dearest Piers, you are not losing that Faith which we used to call our
LINE 188: staff in the dear old days."
LINE 189: Piers was silent for a moment.
LINE 190: "Joyce," he said, at last, "I like to talk to you sometimes. I sit and
LINE 191: read in my den, and go out and in of the sitting room and see how mother
LINE 192: is getting on, and my brain gets full of cobwebs and I am impatient, and
LINE 193: long to spring up into a better and nobler life, and yet I am tied down.
LINE 194: Don't you think I did not feel my miserable weakness when I heard of
LINE 195: Gilbert, in the thick of the rioters, saving a woman and child, and
LINE 196: bravely doing his best in the face of the weakness and incompetence of
LINE 197: those about him? I felt as if I would have given something to get a hard
LINE 198: thump on my head in such a cause, the cause of humanity."
LINE 199: "Piers, you are dull at home, I know, but you have the delightful young
LINE 200: doctor for a friend."
LINE 201: "Yes; but I can't sham illness to get him to come; he is a long way off.
LINE 202: But I am doing some more diagrams for his lecture on Fungi."
LINE 203: "I am so glad; and Piers, when Gilbert can really afford it, we are
LINE 204: going to have a house in the country, and call it 'The Haven,' and you
LINE 205: and mother shall come and live with us, and you shall help me to teach
LINE 206: Falcon, and we shall be so happy."
LINE 207: "Ah! that is looking a long way forward, Joyce. Perhaps my haven will be
LINE 208: here, under the shadow of this old church, before then. But I feel the
LINE 209: better already for being with you, old Joyce; you are just the same as
LINE 210: you ever were."
LINE 211: The brother and sister exchanged a kiss, and then, in the silence of
LINE 212: perfect sympathy and affection, walked back to the house.
LINE 213: * * * * *
LINE 214: The whole family assembled in the dining-room as the bells of the
LINE 215: church rang out the old year. In the pause--that solemn pause before the
LINE 216: clock strikes twelve, and the knell for the dying year is followed by a
LINE 217: great rejoicing peal for that which is new born--Gilbert Arundel read,
LINE 218: in slow, clear tones, that wonderful Psalm which ever seems to be so
LINE 219: fraught with wisdom, and to express so well the yearning of the human
LINE 220: soul for something, which as the generations roll by, and pass like a
LINE 221: tale that is told, remains steadfast and immoveable.
LINE 222: Lord, _thou_ hast been our Refuge; and, notwithstanding the storms and
LINE 223: the troubles of this short and mutable life, faithful hearts like
LINE 224: Joyce's can add, in trusting confidence, "and _wilt_ be to the end."
LINE 225: * * * * *
LINE 226: An hour later, when the last chimes had rung out from every belfry tower
LINE 227: from far and near, and the fair young year lay calm and beautiful
LINE 228: beneath the stars, husband and wife went together to the long, low
LINE 229: nursery, where the three elder children lay in profound slumber. The
LINE 230: kiss and blessing did not disturb Lettice or Lota, but the "Happy new
LINE 231: year, darling," brought Falcon to a state of half consciousness.
LINE 232: "Happy new year, mother--father," he murmured, with an added word which
LINE 233: sounded like "my trumpet."
LINE 234: "That beloved trumpet," said Joyce, laughing. "I let him take it out
LINE 235: into the garden after dinner, and give one great blow; but he was so
LINE 236: loyal, he came and hid it again, out of sight, saying, 'If father heard
LINE 237: that, it was only just _once_.'"
LINE 238: "Dear old boy!" Gilbert said. "I shall not forget his self-denial
LINE 239: learned from his mother."
LINE 240: "Nay," she said, playfully, "I do not quite wish to blow trumpets."
LINE 241: "Not your own, certainly," was the quiet rejoinder.
LINE 242: They did not forget baby Joy. Her cradle was in their own room; and
LINE 243: Joyce called her husband to look at her, and wish her the "happy new
LINE 244: year," as he had wished the others.
LINE 245: "A happy new year to my little Joy," he said.
LINE 246: The baby moved a little, and, throwing one fat arm behind her head, a
LINE 247: flickering smile played over her face, a light rather than a smile, such
LINE 248: as comes over the faces of the little ones sometimes when in sleep,
LINE 249: their angels draw near.
LINE 250: It was one of those supreme moments in life, which do not find
LINE 251: expression in many words:--
LINE 252: "A happy new year to you, my little Joy," Joyce repeated, and then there
LINE 253: was silence, while--
LINE 254: "Two faces o'er the cradle bent,
LINE 255: Two hands above the head were locked,
LINE 256: These pressed each other while they rocked,
LINE 257: Those watched a life that Love had sent.
LINE 258: O solemn hour!
LINE 259: O hidden power!"

LINE 398: Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
LINE 399: law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
LINE 400: so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
LINE 401: States without permission and without paying copyright
LINE 402: royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
LINE 403: of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
LINE 404: Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
LINE 405: concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
LINE 406: and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
LINE 407: the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

LINE 409: copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
LINE 410: easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

LINE 452: claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
LINE 453: displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

LINE 466: agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
LINE 467: distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any

LINE 618: Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
LINE 619: electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
LINE 620: computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
LINE 621: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
LINE 622: from people in all walks of life.
LINE 623: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
LINE 624: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
LINE 625: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
LINE 626: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
LINE 627: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
LINE 628: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
LINE 629: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 630: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
LINE 631: Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 632: Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
LINE 633: The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
LINE 634: 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
LINE 635: state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
LINE 636: Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
LINE 637: number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 638: Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
LINE 639: U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

LINE 644: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
LINE 645: Literary Archive Foundation
LINE 646: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
LINE 647: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
LINE 648: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
LINE 649: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
LINE 650: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
LINE 651: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
LINE 652: status with the IRS.
LINE 653: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
LINE 654: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
LINE 655: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
LINE 656: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
LINE 657: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
LINE 658: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
LINE 659: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
LINE 660: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 661: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
LINE 662: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
LINE 663: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
LINE 664: approach us with offers to donate.
LINE 665: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
LINE 666: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
LINE 667: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
LINE 668: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
LINE 669: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
LINE 670: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
LINE 671: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 672: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
LINE 673: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
LINE 674: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
LINE 675: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
LINE 676: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
LINE 677: volunteer support.
LINE 678: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
LINE 679: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
LINE 680: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
LINE 681: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
LINE 682: edition.
LINE 683: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
LINE 684: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 685: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
LINE 686: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 687: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
LINE 688: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
