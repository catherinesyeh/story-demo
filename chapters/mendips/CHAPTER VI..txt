LINE 1: AMONGST THE HEATHER.
LINE 2: Gilbert Arundel's visit to Fair Acres extended far beyond the limit of a
LINE 3: week. He felt every day more absorbed by the simple, happy life, in
LINE 4: which, as Joyce had said, Melville was the only cloud.
LINE 5: He was an universal favourite. A man who has been accustomed to yield
LINE 6: respect and courtesy to his own mother, seldom fails in yielding it to
LINE 7: the mothers of his friends.
LINE 8: If anyone in the household at Fair Acres was dissatisfied it was
LINE 9: Melville himself, who found that his friend had been so entirely taken
LINE 10: possession of by his brothers and sister, and was held in such high
LINE 11: esteem by his father and mother, that his own light was effectually put
LINE 12: out.
LINE 13: The twins, Harry and Bunny, came to him about fly-fishing, and Ralph
LINE 14: consulted him as to a difficult passage in his Homer; while he spent a
LINE 15: whole morning in helping Piers to re-arrange his moths and butterflies,
LINE 16: and to look out their names with greater precision in a book he had
LINE 17: actually borrowed from the Palace at Wells, for this purpose.
LINE 18: All the time Joyce went about her accustomed duties: darned Melville's
LINE 19: socks, mended the schoolboys' clothes, and was every morning assisting
LINE 20: her mother in her household duties.
LINE 21: It was an added charm in Gilbert's eyes that Joyce made no difference in
LINE 22: her daily routine, and that what are familiarly called "company manners"
LINE 23: were apparently unknown at Fair Acres.
LINE 24: But the last day came of Gilbert Arundel's visit, as the last must come
LINE 25: to everything, and the squire proclaimed a holiday for every one and an
LINE 26: excursion to Wookey, and a pic-nic to Ebbor. Then there was a great
LINE 27: packing of hampers, and loading of one of the spring carts with the boys
LINE 28: and the provisions, and the "four-wheel" with the more grown-up members
LINE 29: of the party.
LINE 30: Even Mrs. Falconer allowed herself to be enlisted in the service, and to
LINE 31: give herself for once a day's pleasure; while Melville put on a
LINE 32: riding-coat of the most approved cut, and a pair of wellingtons, and was
LINE 33: graciously pleased to lend himself for the occasion, with as much show
LINE 34: of satisfaction as was consistent with his dignity.
LINE 35: After depositing the party at Wookey, the squire kindly drove into
LINE 36: Wells in the "four-wheel" to fetch Charlotte from the Vicar's Close, and
LINE 37: before the dinner had been laid in the Ebbor Valley he was back again,
LINE 38: bearing Charlotte in triumph, in spite of his sister's entreaties that
LINE 39: Charlotte would be careful of adders which swarmed at Ebbor amongst the
LINE 40: loose stones; and that she was to be sure to sit upon a cloak with four
LINE 41: capes, made of large plaid, which Miss Falconer insisted should be put
LINE 42: into the carriage.
LINE 43: But nothing spoiled Charlotte's pleasure when fairly off, and she was
LINE 44: delighted to be helped down from the carriage by her Cousin Melville,
LINE 45: with whose fine ways, and what she would have called "elegant dress,"
LINE 46: she had keen sympathy. Indeed, the hero of the "drooping rose" was in
LINE 47: danger of falling from his pedestal; and the fact of a cousin, who said
LINE 48: a great many flattering things to her was, after all, more interesting
LINE 49: than a minor Canon, who was to be worshipped from afar, and who when
LINE 50: actually introduced to her the day before by her aunt, when he called in
LINE 51: virtue of his office in the cathedral, had not seemed to desire to
LINE 52: cultivate her acquaintance; certainly had made her no pretty speeches.
LINE 53: Melville, on the contrary, made her a great many, and she listened with
LINE 54: unquestioning faith, and profound interest to his stories of high life,
LINE 55: and the men with titles with whom he was on familiar terms, and the
LINE 56: large wine parties at Oxford to which Maythorne came.
LINE 57: Gilbert caught the sound of that name, and turning quickly, his deep
LINE 58: blue eyes shot a warning glance, which could not be mistaken, as he said
LINE 59: in a voice audible to those nearest him:
LINE 60: "The less said about _him_ the better."
LINE 61: The day passed quickly, and it was proposed that the younger portion of
LINE 62: the party should walk up the uneven road between the rocks, and, taking
LINE 63: the rough paths over the flat country, into which the gorge opens, reach
LINE 64: Fair Acres by crossing it, a distance of some six miles.
LINE 65: Charlotte was to remain at Fair Acres for the night, but both she and
LINE 66: Melville preferred to drive with the squire and Mrs. Falconer and Piers.
LINE 67: Charlotte's shoes were too thin for scrambling, and a country walk was
LINE 68: not at all to Melville's taste.
LINE 69: "Off with you, then," said the squire, "and mind you keep the road to
LINE 70: the left, or you will find yourselves on Mendip, and if it gets dark
LINE 71: that may not be so pleasant."
LINE 72: "I know the way, father," Ralph said; "and so do Harry and Bunny. We
LINE 73: shall not lose ourselves."
LINE 74: "Perhaps Joyce had better drive," her father said, just as the five
LINE 75: were starting. "Sunshine, what do you think?"
LINE 76: "I think that we are more likely to lose our way, sir," Gilbert said,
LINE 77: "if you take the sun from us."
LINE 78: The squire laughed.
LINE 79: "Well, that may be true. Take care of your sister, boys."
LINE 80: The ascent through the Ebbor cliffs is difficult; there is a vast
LINE 81: quantity of thin sharp stones, worn by the action of the water from the
LINE 82: face of the rocks. Although not nearly so grand as Cheddar, Ebbor has
LINE 83: many points of beauty. The rocks are fantastic in form, and as the path
LINE 84: winds between them they assume various shapes, like miniature towers and
LINE 85: bastions, clothed with ivy, and coloured with dark brown and yellow
LINE 86: lichen.
LINE 87: The air, when they were fairly in the open country, was fresh and crisp;
LINE 88: the lark sang his sweet song high above their heads, and the sweet,
LINE 89: clear notes of distant thrushes and blackbirds came from the low lying
LINE 90: copses, which fringe the head of the Ebbor valley.
LINE 91: Harry and Bunny chased moths for Piers: Ralph meditated and repeated to
LINE 92: himself some lines of a Greek poet which he wanted to get by heart.
LINE 93: Thus, as was only to be expected, Joyce and Mr Arundel were left to
LINE 94: themselves, and in Gilbert's heart at least was the weight of coming
LINE 95: separation, and the uncertainty as to whether he should ever be able to
LINE 96: renew the sweet, free intercourse of the past fortnight. He dreaded to
LINE 97: change the present happy relations between him and Joyce by telling her
LINE 98: what he felt. She confided so entirely in him; she told him so much of
LINE 99: her little joys, and home happiness, of Ralph's cleverness, of Harry and
LINE 100: Bunny's frantic desires to be sailors, of her father's goodness to
LINE 101: Melville, and infinite patience with him. On this last night especially,
LINE 102: he felt that he could not bring himself to break the spell, and disturb
LINE 103: the serenity of that sweet, pure life, by letting friendship go, to
LINE 104: replace it by the more tumultuous and passionate love, which he knew if
LINE 105: once this barrier were broken down, he should pour forth on her in a
LINE 106: torrent which might distress and almost frighten, one so simple and so
LINE 107: unversed in the world's ways.
LINE 108: Whilst Charlotte was always on the look-out for some _preux chevalier_,
LINE 109: who was to be at her feet and vow eternal devotion, Joyce had as yet no
LINE 110: such airy castles. Her education had been widely different from her
LINE 111: cousin's, and home and home interests had so filled her seventeen years
LINE 112: with their joys and pleasures, that she had no time to dream over
LINE 113: "keepsakes," and read Miss Burney's romances, or steep herself in the
LINE 114: unreality of sentimental verses, which Wordsworth was beginning to break
LINE 115: down and send into the shadows, by bringing out the beauties of
LINE 116: creation into the strong light, which his genius threw around them.
LINE 117: Joyce had not wasted her youth in foolish dreams of impossible
LINE 118: perfection, but when the real story of her life was ready to unfold
LINE 119: itself, she would find a zest and fulness in it, that the sentimental
LINE 120: visionary could never know.
LINE 121: That was a memorable walk over the sweet country side, with the west all
LINE 122: aglow, and the sky above serenely blue. In after years both looked back
LINE 123: on it through that mist of tender sadness, which gathers round the happy
LINE 124: past of youth, even though the present is full of the fruition of joy to
LINE 125: which that very past led.
LINE 126: "This is our last evening," Gilbert said; "I hope, if I can be of any
LINE 127: use, you will write to me."
LINE 128: "Yes," Joyce said, "and I feel as if the worst were over now. If
LINE 129: Melville has a year abroad with the gentleman the bishop recommends, he
LINE 130: may settle afterwards. Of course it is a great pull upon father's purse;
LINE 131: but if Harry and Bunny can get into the navy we shall be able to
LINE 132: manage."
LINE 133: "When we are settled in Clifton I hope you will come and see my mother."
LINE 134: "Oh! I should like that very much; but I have a visit to Barley Wood to
LINE 135: come first, and then in the winter I must do all I can to cheer father.
LINE 136: He feels the want of out-door exercise now he has given up his hunters.
LINE 137: He used to ride to the meet very often."
LINE 138: "I am sorry he has had to give that up, all through Melville's
LINE 139: extravagance."
LINE 140: "Yes, and then farming has been so bad the last year or two. I hope it
LINE 141: may be a better crop this year; but the wheat in this district is very
LINE 142: poor at all times. We must not get too much to the right," she said, "or
LINE 143: we shall get near the miners, who are a rough set of people. Mrs. More
LINE 144: has had a school in these parts for many years; but there are a great
LINE 145: many discontented folks, who seem to think the gentry are their natural
LINE 146: enemies. That man we saw the day you came to Wells was from these
LINE 147: parts."
LINE 148: Joyce raised her voice in a clear, ringing tone, and called her brothers
LINE 149: by name.
LINE 150: "They have gone on so far in front," she said; "but I feel sure this is
LINE 151: the right track." She called again, but there was no reply.
LINE 152: "We had better walk faster," she said, "or we shall be left behind;"
LINE 153: then she stopped.
LINE 154: "I see a man lying in that dip under the gorse-bushes. I hope he will
LINE 155: not beg."
LINE 156: She had scarcely spoken the words when a huge form rose before them,
LINE 157: and stood in the narrow track between the heather and gorse, filling up
LINE 158: the path.
LINE 159: "You are Squire Falconer's lass, ain't you?" he said, defiantly.
LINE 160: "Yes," Gilbert answered, "yes; this is Miss Falconer, of Fair Acres. How
LINE 161: long are you going to stand there and prevent us from passing you?"
LINE 162: "Till I've settled my score. Your gov'nor was hard on me t'other day; he
LINE 163: tried to get me sent to gaol. I'll smash his head for 'im next time I
LINE 164: come across 'im, sure as my name is Bob Priday!"
LINE 165: The broad, Somersetshire lingo made the man all but unintelligible to
LINE 166: Gilbert; but Joyce understood him well enough.
LINE 167: "Ye hand me out a guinea, now, or a trinket, and I'll let bygones be
LINE 168: bygones, specially"--with a horrid leer--"if you'll give me a kiss with
LINE 169: 'em; eh?"
LINE 170: In a moment Gilbert had sprung over the bushes which hedged in the track
LINE 171: on either side, and had his hand on the man's throat.
LINE 172: "Let this young lady pass, you villain!" he said, shaking the huge form,
LINE 173: who, taken unawares, had very little power of resistance. "Let her
LINE 174: pass."
LINE 175: There is always something in a brave, strong, young spirit which is too
LINE 176: much for the brute force of an untutored giant like Bob Priday. He
LINE 177: staggered and fell back, Gilbert's hand being still at his throat.
LINE 178: Joyce, pale and trembling, did not lose her self-control. "Please let
LINE 179: me pass," she said; "I have no money to give you, and if I had it would
LINE 180: not be right to bribe you. My father only did his duty on the bench that
LINE 181: day. You were guilty, and you know it; you got off unpunished, and you
LINE 182: should be thankful, and try to lead a better life."
LINE 183: There was something wonderfully grand in the way Joyce spoke, though her
LINE 184: face was white with girlish fear, and her lips quivered, her voice did
LINE 185: not falter as she appealed to the huge man who might, she knew, shake
LINE 186: off Gilbert's restraining hand, and spring on her at any moment.
LINE 187: "Let me pass," she said, "and this gentleman will----"
LINE 188: At this moment a woman's voice was heard, and a girl with a red
LINE 189: handkerchief on her head, with an effort at respectable attire in her
LINE 190: short, blue cotton frock, and large, thick boots, came over the tangled
LINE 191: mass of heath and ling, and cried:
LINE 192: "Father! What are you about now, father?"
LINE 193: "You mind your own business, you hussy, and leave me alone."
LINE 194: "Oh, father!" the girl said, passionately, "I wish you would be good.
LINE 195: Think how mother used to pray for you! Oh, dear lady," the girl said,
LINE 196: bursting into tears, "I am heart-broken about father. Please, sir, let
LINE 197: him go."
LINE 198: "Let me go!" said the giant, with a loud, discordant laugh; "I'll see
LINE 199: about that." Then, with a mighty effort, he hurled Gilbert from him, and
LINE 200: before he could recover his feet, he had seized Joyce's arm. "Give me
LINE 201: the money, or I'll be even with your father; curse him!"
LINE 202: But the girl threw herself on her father and held him back, while
LINE 203: Gilbert, stunned and bewildered by the force with which he had been
LINE 204: hurled over the heather, staggered to his feet again, and, with a
LINE 205: well-aimed blow at the back of the man's head, laid him sprawling on
LINE 206: the path.
LINE 207: "Oh! I hope he is not hurt!" Joyce exclaimed involuntarily, as the huge
LINE 208: form lay motionless; the girl leaning over him.
LINE 209: "He is not hurt," Gilbert said, "any more than he has hurt me; it was in
LINE 210: self-defence," he added.
LINE 211: "Father, father!" moaned the girl. "Oh, sir! oh, miss! I don't know what
LINE 212: to do!"
LINE 213: "Hold your tongue, and let me get up and at him again," growled the man,
LINE 214: struggling to sit upright.
LINE 215: But his daughter had the advantage, and seated herself on her father's
LINE 216: chest, saying to Gilbert, "I'll keep him quiet till you are out of
LINE 217: sight, sir; I will indeed. I know you were driven to do it," she said.
LINE 218: "Father is always fighting; but, oh! sir, we have a hard time of it.
LINE 219: There is no work for the men and boys, and if it were not for the good
LINE 220: lady's schools, and the help she gives, I don't know what would become
LINE 221: of us. Many were starving last winter, and of course it is kind of hard,
LINE 222: to know rich folks have plenty and we are starving. Mother died last
LINE 223: fall; and though Mrs. More sent her physic, and the schoolmistress
LINE 224: broth, she could not stand up against the fever, and trouble about poor
LINE 225: father and Jim, and Dick, and the baby."
LINE 226: Joyce's eyes filled with tears. "What is to be done?" she said,
LINE 227: helplessly; "what can be done?"
LINE 228: "I don't know, miss; I don't know. There's plenty of the ore left, but
LINE 229: it is no use working it, there's no market for it. Mrs. More teaches us
LINE 230: to pray to God and try to trust Him, but He does not seem to hear or
LINE 231: help. I have been in service, and could get a place again at a Farm at
LINE 232: Publow, through Mrs. More, but since mother is gone, there is none to
LINE 233: look after baby. I do love the baby!"
LINE 234: "How long are you going to jaw like this, Sue? Let me get up and settle
LINE 235: the question; if not now, I _will_ settle it at last."
LINE 236: "Come away," Gilbert said, putting his hand on Joyce's arm; "we can do
LINE 237: no good. It is getting so dark. Do come!" He put his hand to his head,
LINE 238: for he still felt dazed and giddy with his fall.
LINE 239: "Tell me your name," Joyce said, "and where I should find you."
LINE 240: "Susan Priday, Mendip Mines, that's my name, miss."
LINE 241: "I am going to see Mrs. More soon, and I will tell her about you," Joyce
LINE 242: said, in a low tone; "and do believe I am sorry for you. How old are
LINE 243: you?"
LINE 244: "Eighteen come Christmas," the girl said, looking up into Joyce's
LINE 245: beautiful face with undisguised admiration.
LINE 246: "Just my age," Joyce said. "Oh, I should like to make you happy! How old
LINE 247: is the baby?"
LINE 248: "Born when mother died--just nine months old; he is so pretty, he is!"
LINE 249: Joyce had seldom, if ever, spoken familiarly to any of the girls about
LINE 250: the country side before. Mrs. Falconer had her views on the subject, and
LINE 251: the "miner folks" were her especial aversion, while Mrs. More's attempts
LINE 252: to civilise them were met with derision and scorn. The gulf set between
LINE 253: her and her household of respectable maids, and the rough, half-clothed
LINE 254: miner's families, was in her eyes impassable! What was the use of
LINE 255: trying to reclaim those who preferred their own rough and evil ways?
LINE 256: They ought to be well punished for raids made on farm yards, and snares
LINE 257: set in copses and plantations; but to teach them to read, and talk to
LINE 258: them about their duty to God and their neighbour, was in Mrs. Falconer's
LINE 259: eyes worse than lost labour; it did harm rather than good.
LINE 260: And not only by Mrs. Falconer was this view of the unclothed and
LINE 261: unwashed masses taken! In our days of widely spread and organised
LINE 262: charities, and zeal, sometimes I fear hardly tempered with wisdom, it is
LINE 263: difficult to throw ourselves back to the beginning of the century now
LINE 264: drawing to its close, when efforts like those of the four sisters of the
LINE 265: Mendips, of whom Hannah was the leading spirit, were met with scoffs and
LINE 266: disapproval; or deep compassion, that educated women could be so
LINE 267: misguided, as to wish to teach the boys and girls of their district,
LINE 268: anything but to use their legs and arms in the service of their betters!
LINE 269: As I stood by the heavy stone in Wrington churchyard, in the gloom of
LINE 270: an autumn afternoon, where the names of the four sisters are inscribed,
LINE 271: I could but think of the gratitude we ought to feel to them for their
LINE 272: brave efforts to spread the knowledge of the religion of Christ amongst
LINE 273: the poor of those 'rolling hills' and peaceful valleys of
LINE 274: Somersetshire. It must have been hard for a woman of culture like Hannah
LINE 275: More to be met by opposition, and in some cases fierce denunciation;
LINE 276: harder still to be smiled at by those in high places, as a fanatic and a
LINE 277: visionary. But turning from the ugly, weather-worn stone, enclosed in
LINE 278: high rusty railings, to the beautiful church, where what light there was
LINE 279: yet in the sky, came through the many-coloured window lately erected to
LINE 280: Hannah More's memory, I thought, that as nothing that is good and
LINE 281: beautiful, coming from the Fountain of all beauty and all goodness, can
LINE 282: ever die, so the light which Hannah More kindled in many humble hearts
LINE 283: was still shining in the eternal kingdom, where those that have lived as
LINE 284: in the presence of the Son of God here, shine as the stars for ever in
LINE 285: their Heavenly Father's realm.
LINE 286: That touch of Nature which makes the whole world kin brought the two
LINE 287: girls near to each other, as Joyce laid her hand upon Susan's, and said:
LINE 288: "I am very sorry for you; I shall not forget you;" then added, looking
LINE 289: down on the prostrate form which Susan had so determinedly kept from
LINE 290: doing further mischief:
LINE 291: "I am sorry for you, too; it must be hard to want bread--but, but--do
LINE 292: try to be good and find work."
LINE 293: "Find work, find work! If that's all you can say you'd better hold your
LINE 294: tongue."
LINE 295: But though the words were rough the tones grew less fierce, and Susan,
LINE 296: finding her restraint was no longer needed, stood up and watched Gilbert
LINE 297: Arundel and Joyce pursue the narrow track across the heather till they
LINE 298: were lost in the shadows of the gathering twilight.
LINE 299: "Do you know your way?" Gilbert asked.
LINE 300: "I think I do," Joyce answered; "our shepherd's cottage is on the next
LINE 301: ridge, and when we get there we can see our own valley and the tower of
LINE 302: the church."
LINE 303: "Are you very tired?" Gilbert asked again.
LINE 304: "Not very; but I cannot help trembling; it is so silly. Do tell me if
LINE 305: that man hurt you."
LINE 306: "He gave me a good shaking. What a giant he is! I felt as your Nip or
LINE 307: Pip might feel in Duke's clutches if he were angry."
LINE 308: "What a comfort we had not Charlotte with us, and that the boys had gone
LINE 309: on so far! I hope they will not be very anxious at home."
LINE 310: They made but slow progress. Joyce's usually swift, elastic steps were
LINE 311: slow and faltering. She took several wrong paths, and they came once to
LINE 312: a steep dip in the heather, and were within a few inches of one of
LINE 313: those rocky pits which are frequent on the face of the level country
LINE 314: about Cheddar and the neighbouring district. Indeed Cheddar itself
LINE 315: begins with one of these small defiles, when entered from the top of the
LINE 316: Mendip, and the gradually increasing height of the rocks, and the
LINE 317: widening of the gorge as the road winds through it, is one of its most
LINE 318: striking features.
LINE 319: Joyce was so wholly unaccustomed to feel tired and unnerved, that she
LINE 320: surprised herself, as well as Gilbert, by sitting down helplessly, and
LINE 321: bursting into tears.
LINE 322: "Oh! we should have been killed if we had fallen down there. Won't you
LINE 323: leave me, and go on to the shepherd's cottage? What can be the matter
LINE 324: with me?" she said, sobbing hysterically.
LINE 325: Gilbert hardly knew whether distress at her condition, or delight in
LINE 326: having her all to himself to comfort, predominated.
LINE 327: "Do not be frightened,' he said; we shall get on very well if you will
LINE 328: let me carry you."
LINE 329: "Oh! no, no," she said, trying to spring up with her accustomed energy.
LINE 330: "I will push on again."
LINE 331: But although she summoned all her courage, she was obliged to let
LINE 332: Gilbert put his arm round her and support her, and finally she was
LINE 333: lifted in his strong arms and carried whether she wished it or not.
LINE 334: "I shall tire you so dreadfully," Joyce whispered.
LINE 335: "If you do, it is the sweetest tiredness I ever knew; you know that,
LINE 336: Joyce."
LINE 337: Then they went on in silence. Gilbert was still suffering from the
LINE 338: treatment he had received at Bob Priday's hands, and they made slow
LINE 339: progress.
LINE 340: "Just raise your head," he said, after ten minutes' tramp through the
LINE 341: narrow track, which he lost at times through the thick tangle of heath
LINE 342: and gorse and low-growing bracken. "Raise your head and tell me if you
LINE 343: can see the shepherd's cottage. It is getting very dark."
LINE 344: Joyce did as he told her, but, after straining her eyes for a few
LINE 345: moments, she said:
LINE 346: "I can't see anything, it is so dark. I don't know where we are. Oh, I
LINE 347: don't know!"
LINE 348: "You are safe with me," Gilbert said; and then added, fervently: "I am
LINE 349: not afraid for God is with us."
LINE 350: It was so unusual for Joyce to hear that Name spoken. She did not
LINE 351: respond, but let her head fall upon his shoulder again.
LINE 352: Presently he said:
LINE 353: "There is a tiny light now--two lights--they must be in the shepherd's
LINE 354: cottage. Take heart, my darling. We shall soon be home."
LINE 355: The word had slipped from his lips unawares.
LINE 356: "I am going away early to-morrow. You will not forget me?"
LINE 357: Once more she raised her face, and in the dim light he saw her beautiful
LINE 358: eyes gazing at him with an expression which was half wonder and half
LINE 359: joy. But she said, simply:
LINE 360: "No, I will never forget you."
LINE 361: The light was close to them now, and there was a sound of men's feet
LINE 362: drawing nearer and then Duke came bounding up.
LINE 363: With a cry of "Father! father!" Joyce struggled to her feet, and threw
LINE 364: herself into her father's arms.
LINE 365: "Why, Joyce, my Sunshine, where have you been? We have been very
LINE 366: anxious, your mother on thorns, and poor Piers imagining all kinds of
LINE 367: disasters. Why did you not keep up with the boys? They had been at home
LINE 368: an hour before I started. What has happened sir?" the squire said,
LINE 369: turning a little sharply on Gilbert Arundel.
LINE 370: "It is too long a story to tell now, sir," Gilbert said. "Miss Falconer
LINE 371: and I fell into bad hands, and we may thank God nothing worse has
LINE 372: happened."
LINE 373: "Some of the miners, eh?"
LINE 374: "One of them, sir, who is a host in himself; he blocked our way, and
LINE 375: threatened us; but I would rather not go over it all now. She is so
LINE 376: overwrought, though she has been so splendidly brave."
LINE 377: "Oh! father, dearest dad! take me home," Joyce said. "Is it far; is it
LINE 378: far?"
LINE 379: "Some two miles, my Sunshine; but I can carry you. Now for it, be brave,
LINE 380: my sweet one, and we shall soon be home. Now, then, Sam and Thomas,
LINE 381: march on."
LINE 382: "I think I can walk, father now," Joyce said; "and here is Duke, dear
LINE 383: Duke!"
LINE 384: "Why, of course, I brought Duke. He is cleverer at finding his way than
LINE 385: I am. He soon snuffed you out, good old fellow."
LINE 386: The two other men now turned towards home, with the big lanthorns in
LINE 387: their hands, which served for guiding stars. Duke paced slowly between
LINE 388: the men, and his master and young mistress, and Gilbert brought up the
LINE 389: rear.
LINE 390: The lights of the village were a welcome sight, and the hall door of
LINE 391: Fair Acres was open as they came up the road, showing a group of dark,
LINE 392: expectant figures, thrown out by the blaze of a wood fire.
LINE 393: "The mistress has lit a fire that we might have a welcome; that is like
LINE 394: her wisdom," the squire said. "A few tallow candles would not have been
LINE 395: half as cheerful."
LINE 396: "Here we are; here we are!" the squire called out; and then there was a
LINE 397: rush of boyish feet, and a great chorus of rejoicing, and a host of
LINE 398: questions.
LINE 399: "We have been so anxious, _dying_ of anxiety," exclaimed Charlotte,
LINE 400: thinking it necessary to begin to cry.
LINE 401: "What fools you were to walk over that rough, lonely country," Melville
LINE 402: said. While Piers could only hover round Joyce, who, seated on a bench
LINE 403: or old-fashioned settle by the side of the wide open hearth, held her
LINE 404: mother in a tight embrace.
LINE 405: "The boys ought never to have left you," Piers said. "How could Mr.
LINE 406: Arundel find the way?"
LINE 407: "Joyce knew it," said Bunny. "Joyce knew it. We have been over that
LINE 408: track several times."
LINE 409: "Yes," echoed Harry, "several times; only Joyce and Mr. Arundel were
LINE 410: talking so much, they never thought where they were going."
LINE 411: "'All's well that ends well,'" said the squire. "She had better go to
LINE 412: bed, my dear; and this young gentleman looks white enough. You must get
LINE 413: him a good hot glass of negus; and I hope supper is ready; but take the
LINE 414: poor child to bed first."
LINE 415: Mrs. Falconer had not said much beyond a few words in Joyce's ear, which
LINE 416: no one else heard. Her usual vivacity and quick, sharp words seemed to
LINE 417: have suddenly failed her.
LINE 418: "Yes; I'll take her to bed, and there she will have to lie all
LINE 419: to-morrow, I expect. It's the last time I'll allow her to separate from
LINE 420: the rest of us, when we are out on an excursion. Order the supper in,
LINE 421: boys; and Melville, look after your friend; he is as white as a ghost;
LINE 422: perhaps he has seen one!"
LINE 423: The tone was a little bitter and satirical. Mrs. Falconer resented the
LINE 424: hours' keen anxiety she had endured, and was inclined to lay the fault
LINE 425: on Gilbert.
LINE 426: He certainly did look exhausted, and leaned back with his head against
LINE 427: the wall, over which a large stag's head with spreading antlers gazed
LINE 428: down upon him with liquid, meaningless eyes.
LINE 429: "Mother," Joyce said, as, with her brother's arm round her, she rose to
LINE 430: go upstairs; "mother, Mr. Arundel was so very brave; he was thrown down
LINE 431: by that dreadful man and nearly stunned; he carried me till we met
LINE 432: father; he was--he was--so good to me. Do pray thank him." Then
LINE 433: disengaging herself from her mother's grasp, Joyce tottered across to
LINE 434: the old oak chair, on which Gilbert had sunk. "Good-night, and
LINE 435: good-bye," she said; "and don't think them ungrateful. Good-bye."
LINE 436: He stood upright, and took one of her hands in his, raised it reverently
LINE 437: to his lips; and so they parted.
LINE 438: He was off the next morning early to catch the coach at Wells. Not this
LINE 439: time in a post-chaise with scarlet-clad post-boy, but driven by the
LINE 440: squire himself, in a high gig, his portmanteau strapped behind. Melville
LINE 441: roused himself to come down in a magnificent flowered dressing-gown, to
LINE 442: see him off; and the boys were all there. Just as the gig was starting,
LINE 443: Mrs. Falconer appeared. It was unusual for her to be later than her
LINE 444: household, but she had a good reason, for Joyce had passed a restless
LINE 445: night, and she had not liked to leave her. She was asleep now, she said,
LINE 446: and a day's rest would restore her.
LINE 447: "I hope we shall see you here again," Mrs. Falconer added, "before long.
LINE 448: But you won't be trusted on the Mendips again, I can tell you!"
LINE 449: "Let bygones be bygones, that's my motto," said the squire, as the gig
LINE 450: went swinging out through the white gates near the house, and turned
LINE 451: into the road which led through the village.
LINE 452: "And 'all's well that ends well,'" Gilbert said, as he waved his hat in
LINE 453: token of farewell.
LINE 454: That evening, when the squire and his wife were alone together, Mrs.
LINE 455: Falconer said:
LINE 456: "Did Mr. Arundel say anything to you as he drove into Wells?"
LINE 457: "Say!" exclaimed the squire. "Well, he is not dumb. He said his head
LINE 458: ached, for one thing."
LINE 459: "Ah!" said Mrs. Falconer; "he did not say any thing about his heart?"
LINE 460: The squire puffed a little smoke from his long clay pipe; for he
LINE 461: indulged in a pipe sometimes, though the amount of tobacco consumed in
LINE 462: the present day would have amazed him, and shocked him also, had he
LINE 463: known that the greatest smokers were the young men and boys, to whom,
LINE 464: sixty years ago, smoking was forbidden. He did not seem inclined to say
LINE 465: anything in reply to his wife's last question.
LINE 466: "Because," said Mrs. Falconer, with that far-seeing and oracular wisdom
LINE 467: in which men hope in vain to rival us in these matters, at least;
LINE 468: "because I believe Gilbert Arundel is in love with our Joyce."
LINE 469: "Well," said the squire, "that would be no wonder to me; but I daresay
LINE 470: it is only one of your fancies, Kate."
LINE 471: "We shall see; we shall see," said Mrs. Falconer. "I only hope he has
LINE 472: not trifled with my child, and that my 'fancies,' as you call them,
LINE 473: _are_ fancies, that is all."
