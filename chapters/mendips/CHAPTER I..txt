LINE 1: It was a fair morning of early summer, when the low beams of the eastern
LINE 2: sun, threw flickering shadows across the lawn, which lay before Fair
LINE 3: Acres Manor, nestling under the shelter of the Mendip Hills, somewhere
LINE 4: between Wells and Cheddar.
LINE 5: Truth compels me to say, that the lawn was covered with daisies, and
LINE 6: that their bright eyes looked fearlessly up into the blue sky; for
LINE 7: mowing machines were unknown, and the old gardener, coachman, and
LINE 8: universal out-of-door servant sharpened his scythe, only at long
LINE 9: intervals, to lay the heads of the flowers low, so that the daisies grew
LINE 10: and flourished, and had a good time of it.
LINE 11: I know that daisy-speckled turf is considered an offence in the eyes of
LINE 12: the modern gardener. I know with what zeal the spud is used; how large
LINE 13: bare places are regarded with delight; how seed is scattered over them,
LINE 14: which the birds watch with cunning glances from the neighbouring shrubs
LINE 15: and trees, and pounce down upon, as soon as the diligent master of the
LINE 16: place, has straightened his aching back and turned it upon the scene of
LINE 17: his labours.
LINE 18: The dewy lawn before Fair Acres, with its beautiful mosaic of white and
LINE 19: gold, fringed with circles of deepest crimson here and there, would not
LINE 20: suit the taste of the conventional gardener of these days; nor would the
LINE 21: low, irregular building which overlooked it, be considered an attractive
LINE 22: or fitting residence, for the sons and daughters of the small country
LINE 23: squire in the ninth decade of the century.
LINE 24: But in the second decade, in which my story opens, things were
LINE 25: different. The country squire lived a country life. He farmed his own
LINE 26: acres, he walked over his own fields; his 'stock' were individual cows
LINE 27: and horses to him; he could pat each one and call it by its name. His
LINE 28: house was his home, and the restlessness of travel, and longing for
LINE 29: excitement had not as yet, for the most part, disturbed either him or
LINE 30: his children.
LINE 31: Now the resonant steam eagle, as it flies across the country side, seems
LINE 32: to call upon the dwellers in rural districts to follow where it leads,
LINE 33: and an isolated manorial farm like Fair Acres, and a family like the
LINE 34: Falconers who inhabited it, are all but impossible to find nowadays.
LINE 35: Nor would we grumble that the stream of Progress bears us all upon its
LINE 36: breast with the strong resistless current, of which we are scarcely
LINE 37: conscious. The busy rush of life has its brighter side, for there are
LINE 38: wider fields of service opened out for our sons, and the selfishness
LINE 39: which was apt to spring from a secluded life in the heart of the hills,
LINE 40: is counteracted by contact with many men, and many minds. Human sympathy
LINE 41: is quickened, and love is drawn forth, and the labourers who long for
LINE 42: work in the harvest field have the way made easy for them; tools are put
LINE 43: into the hands of our daughters with which they may, if they will, carve
LINE 44: their own lot in life, and none can complain now that life is wasted for
LINE 45: lack of opportunity, for opportunities start up on every side in this
LINE 46: active, zealous, go-a-head age in which we find ourselves.
LINE 47: But in spite of all such advantages and due acknowledgment of their
LINE 48: value, it is refreshing to turn to quiet and peaceful habitations like
LINE 49: Fair Acres, and live again a quieter and less complex life than that
LINE 50: which we have grown to believe is necessary in these later times.
LINE 51: As the sun threw its level beams from the east across the lawn,
LINE 52: thousands of diamond drops sparkled and shimmered in the light, and it
LINE 53: touched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a
LINE 54: white gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,
LINE 55: behind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.
LINE 56: Joyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to
LINE 57: look back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.
LINE 58: A peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose
LINE 59: against a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few
LINE 60: cottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three
LINE 61: farms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at
LINE 62: a higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature
LINE 63: Cheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open
LINE 64: country, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble
LINE 65: cathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful
LINE 66: cathedral village of Wells.
LINE 67: Joyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly
LINE 68: landscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her
LINE 69: father called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,
LINE 70: who was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of
LINE 71: fancy, would say, "Joyce is the child's name; and what can suit her
LINE 72: better? I don't like nick-names."
LINE 73: Nevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the
LINE 74: white gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:
LINE 75: "Hallo, Sunshine!"
LINE 76: "Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning."
LINE 77: The squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart
LINE 78: man, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up
LINE 79: to his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from
LINE 80: any idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with
LINE 81: sedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large
LINE 82: retriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about
LINE 83: in every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally
LINE 84: turning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though
LINE 85: accompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.
LINE 86: "I am up first to-day, daddy!" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the
LINE 87: gentle descent and linked her arm in her father's. "I am first, and is
LINE 88: not it beautiful to be alive on such a day?"
LINE 89: The squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter's waist, he
LINE 90: said, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:
LINE 91: "Beautiful! yes," thinking, though he did not say so, that the most
LINE 92: beautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his
LINE 93: darling Joyce.
LINE 94: "I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay," he said; "but the glass
LINE 95: went up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this
LINE 96: morning."
LINE 97: "When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?"
LINE 98: "To-morrow, in the home meadow," was the reply. "I am going into Wells
LINE 99: to-day, for the magistrates' meeting."
LINE 100: "May I come, father?"
LINE 101: "Well, I've no objection, if mother has not," was the answer. "You must
LINE 102: ask her leave."
LINE 103: "I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;
LINE 104: and you don't like commissions at shops, daddy."
LINE 105: The squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the
LINE 106: two began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on
LINE 107: the side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the
LINE 108: light step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in
LINE 109: the highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.
LINE 110: As she stood there in the light of the morning, Joyce Falconer was a
LINE 111: fair picture of happy, joyous maidenhood. Her figure was lithe and
LINE 112: supple, and though I am afraid her lilac cotton frock would be despised
LINE 113: as only fit for a maid-servant in these days, it became her well. It was
LINE 114: made with a full skirt and a loose body, cut rather low at the neck,
LINE 115: with sleeves which were large on the shoulder, gradually tightening to
LINE 116: the wrist, and displayed to advantage a well-rounded arm. Joyce's shoes
LINE 117: were thick; but though, perhaps, a trifle clumsy, they did not spoil the
LINE 118: symmetry of her pretty ankle and high-arched instep. Snowy "tuckers" of
LINE 119: crimped muslin were sewn into the neck and wrists of her gown, and she
LINE 120: wore an apron with a bib; an old-fashioned apron, guiltless of bows or
LINE 121: lace.
LINE 122: Her abundant chestnut hair was gathered on the top of her small head,
LINE 123: and fell in curls on either side of her smooth white brow; not concealed
LINE 124: now by the large Dunstable straw bonnet, which was hanging to her arm by
LINE 125: the strings, and left the gentle breeze of the morning free, to play
LINE 126: amongst the clustering curls, at their own sweet will.
LINE 127: Joyce's features were regular, and her complexion rosy and healthy.
LINE 128: Indeed, everything about her seemed to tell of youth and the full
LINE 129: enjoyment of the gifts which God had given her.
LINE 130: "A perfect little rustic!" her aunt in the Vicar's close at Wells called
LINE 131: her sometimes, and would suggest to her father that a year or two at a
LINE 132: "finishing school" would be an advantage.
LINE 133: But the squire could not bring himself to part from his only daughter,
LINE 134: and her education had been, I am afraid, sadly neglected.
LINE 135: "Well, little one," Mr. Falconer said, as he seated himself on a rough
LINE 136: wooden bench, "what is this?" touching the cover of a book that peeped
LINE 137: from her apron pocket.
LINE 138: "It is a book, father, Charlotte lent me: Mrs. Hemans' poems."
LINE 139: "Ah! poetry is a good thing when it is kept in its right place."
LINE 140: "I have been learning a long poem called 'Edith,' and I repeat it when I
LINE 141: am darning stockings, picking up a stitch for every word. Don't you
LINE 142: understand, father?"
LINE 143: "I never darned a stocking," he said, laughing.
LINE 144: "Ah! happy father! Mother has now given me six pairs of Melville's new
LINE 145: socks, to strengthen the heels. In and out, in and out with the long
LINE 146: needle; I have to try very hard not to grumble, so I say 'Edith' as a
LINE 147: comfort, and to help me on."
LINE 148: 'The woods--oh! solemn are the boundless woods
LINE 149: Of the great Western world when day declines,
LINE 150: And louder sounds the roll of distant floods,
LINE 151: More deep the rustling of the solemn pines;
LINE 152: When darkness gathers o'er the stilly air,
LINE 153: And mystery seems o'er every leaf to brood,
LINE 154: Awful it is for human heart to bear
LINE 155: The weight and burden of the solitude.'
LINE 156: "Father," she said, suddenly stopping, "you are thinking of something
LINE 157: that troubles you. I know it by the deep line on your forehead, between
LINE 158: your eyes. May I know, father?"
LINE 159: "Well, Sunshine, I am troubled about Melville; he wants to go and see
LINE 160: the world, he says. I have given him as good an education as befits his
LINE 161: station in life. He has made little use of it; and the bills for the
LINE 162: last term at Oxford have been enormous."
LINE 163: "How shameful!" Joyce exclaimed.
LINE 164: "Things are so different from what they were when I was a boy," the
LINE 165: squire said. "Why, I never dreamed of anything beyond doing my duty
LINE 166: here. I took the farming business off your grandfather's shoulders
LINE 167: before I was five-and-twenty. I was his steward, as Melville ought to be
LINE 168: mine, and leave me free. As it is, I have to pay Watson, and look into
LINE 169: everything myself, when I have a son of three-and-twenty, who ought to
LINE 170: do all this for me. I suppose it can't be helped," the squire said,
LINE 171: stretching out his legs, and taking up the gun which had been resting
LINE 172: against the bench, "and as far as I can see the younger boys will be
LINE 173: very little, if any, better than Melville."
LINE 174: "Oh! yes, father. Ralph will do anything you wish, I know; and Hal and
LINE 175: Bunny are very good at school. Remember what the master said of them at
LINE 176: Christmas."
LINE 177: "Yes, yes; they are good little fellows. Then there is poor Piers; he
LINE 178: must always be an anxiety, poor boy!"
LINE 179: "I don't think any of us can be happier than Piers," Joyce said. "He
LINE 180: never complains because he is lame; and he is as contented as possible,
LINE 181: making his collection of moths and butterflies, and bird's eggs, and
LINE 182: things. No, father, don't be unhappy about Piers."
LINE 183: "Do you think, Joyce, I ever forget that it was my carelessness which
LINE 184: made the boy a cripple? I never forget it."
LINE 185: "No one else thinks of it, dear daddy," Joyce said, slipping her hand
LINE 186: into her father's, as it rested on his knee. "No one else thinks of it;
LINE 187: and you know the colt had been broken in, and----"
LINE 188: "The child ought never to have put his legs across it, Joyce; and I
LINE 189: lifted him on, and told him not to be a coward. Ah!" said the squire,
LINE 190: suddenly starting to his feet. "I cannot speak of it; I dare not."
LINE 191: He began an abrupt descent the way that they had come. Nip and Pip, who
LINE 192: had been sleeping with their noses on their paws, and one eye open,
LINE 193: raced off, while Duke drew himself into a standing position, and walked
LINE 194: demurely down the steep bit of turf, with the brush of his tail waving
LINE 195: from side to side as he went.
LINE 196: Joyce did not follow immediately. Her bright face was clouded with the
LINE 197: sympathy she felt for her father. It all came back to her: the group
LINE 198: before the Manor, the child of eight years old, saying, "I am afraid of
LINE 199: riding Rioter, father." Then the father's answer, "Afraid! Don't be a
LINE 200: coward, Piers; you have a good seat enough for such a little chap. Here,
LINE 201: let me put you on." The boy's white, set face, as he grasped the reins;
LINE 202: and Rioter was off like lightning. "His brothers rode long before they
LINE 203: were his age," the squire had said; "it won't do to tie him to his
LINE 204: mother's apron strings, because he happens to be the youngest." Then the
LINE 205: sound of returning horse's feet, and Rioter rushed up the side drive to
LINE 206: the stables riderless. Another minute and old Thomas appeared with a
LINE 207: lifeless burden in his arms, which the squire took from him, with a
LINE 208: groan of remorse, as he turned into the house with him and said to his
LINE 209: wife, "I have killed the boy."
LINE 210: But Piers was not killed. His injuries were life-long, but his life was
LINE 211: spared.
LINE 212: Whether it was from an instinctive feeling, that his father considered
LINE 213: himself the cause of his lameness and generally invalided condition, or
LINE 214: whether the latent buoyancy of his nature asserted itself above all the
LINE 215: privations which the accident had brought upon him, or whether both of
LINE 216: these causes were at work within him, certain it is that Piers was the
LINE 217: most cheerful and most uncomplaining member of the squire's household,
LINE 218: and never allowed any one to pity him, or to treat him as an object of
LINE 219: compassion. Joyce was right when she said that no one was happier than
LINE 220: Piers. Every bird and insect had a charm for him, and were his friends
LINE 221: and companions. Books of natural history were rare; but Bewick's Birds
LINE 222: sufficed for Piers' needs. The "Natural History of Selborne" and old
LINE 223: Isaak Walton's "Angler" were also amongst the boy's scanty library, and
LINE 224: keen perception and acute observation supplied the place of extraneous
LINE 225: help; and Piers was content.
LINE 226: The cloud soon cleared from Joyce's face as a well-known whistle was
LINE 227: heard from the copse, and Joyce answered it with a clear note of
LINE 228: welcome:
LINE 229: "Here, Piers."
LINE 230: Then the quick, even thud of crutches, and Piers came in sight.
LINE 231: In a moment Joyce was springing down the grassy hill-side, and, with a
LINE 232: hardly perceptible touch on her brother's shoulder, she joined him as he
LINE 233: came up.
LINE 234: "I say, Joyce, if you go to Wells to-day with father, will you take this
LINE 235: little sparrow-hawk to old Plume's to be stuffed? Here, rummage in my
LINE 236: pocket, left-hand side--there he is! He is a perfect specimen, and a
LINE 237: pretty rare one. The stable-boy found him lying on his back under the
LINE 238: dove-cot. Perhaps he got the worst of it in a fight. Anyhow, he is dead,
LINE 239: and I have a nice nook for him in my big case."
LINE 240: "Poor dear little birdie," Joyce said, stroking the soft feathers. "Oh!
LINE 241: Piers, why must everything die? It seems so hard. And this is the
LINE 242: puzzle, that we--you and I--may die to-day, next week, any day; and yet
LINE 243: we don't really behave as if we believed it. I feel on a morning like
LINE 244: this, for instance, so full of life, it is so delicious to live, and as
LINE 245: if I never could die. It is so beautiful to be living, so sad to be
LINE 246: dead! To think, Piers, of this little bird singing sweetly----"
LINE 247: "Sparrow-hawks don't sing very sweetly; they chirrup and whistle," Piers
LINE 248: interrupted.
LINE 249: "Ah, well, he thought he sang sweetly, and so did his mother; so it came
LINE 250: to the same thing. Poor little sweet." And Joyce held the little
LINE 251: lifeless bird against her rounded chin and pressed her lips upon it.
LINE 252: Suddenly Piers said:
LINE 253: "What is wrong about Melville; there's something fresh, for I heard my
LINE 254: mother talking about it before I was up."
LINE 255: "He says he won't come here and take care of the farm. He wants to
LINE 256: travel."
LINE 257: "Well, I don't blame him for that," said Piers.
LINE 258: "But his debts have hampered father dreadfully I know, and he does so
LINE 259: detest his fine gentleman airs. It seems to me," said Joyce, vehemently,
LINE 260: "to be ashamed of a father like ours is--Oh! I have no word bad enough,
LINE 261: and Melville _is_ ashamed, and he does not like mother looking after the
LINE 262: dairy and the butter."
LINE 263: "Well," said Piers, tapping his crutch upon the ground, "I think mother
LINE 264: does fidget and worry too much in the house and about the place; but it
LINE 265: is her way, and no one could alter it."
LINE 266: "I don't know that I wish to alter it," Joyce said, hotly. "Mother has
LINE 267: done so much for us, and I hate to think she is slighted by her
LINE 268: children. Melville _does_ slight her, and when he talks in that
LINE 269: drawling, affected voice, and ties his starched cravats twenty times,
LINE 270: and flings them down again if the bow is crooked. I despise _him_, and
LINE 271: that is the truth."
LINE 272: Piers shrugged his shoulders.
LINE 273: "Well, we must go back to breakfast," he said; "I am hungry, and it must
LINE 274: be nearly eight o'clock."
LINE 275: The brother and sister walked slowly towards the house, and as they
LINE 276: crossed the lawn, from which the sun had kissed away all the dewdrops, a
LINE 277: bell over the stables rang, and a little alert figure appeared in the
LINE 278: porch.
LINE 279: "Joyce, Joyce! What are you dawdling for? It is past eight o'clock.
LINE 280: Getting your feet drenched with the dew, I'll warrant. No, don't bring
LINE 281: any dead birds here, Piers; I won't have it. The house is just like a
LINE 282: pigsty with all your rubbish. Take it round to the back kitchen. I have
LINE 283: a pretty hard morning's work before me, and you must lend a hand, Joyce,
LINE 284: I can tell you."
LINE 285: "Father said I was to go with him to Wells, mother, and do your
LINE 286: shopping."
LINE 287: "Well, that won't be till eleven o'clock. There's time enough first to
LINE 288: help me to give out the stores and get the linen aired for the boys'
LINE 289: room and the spare bedroom, and you forget, I suppose, that your
LINE 290: brothers are coming home for the holidays on Friday, and this is
LINE 291: Wednesday. I shall be all behindhand, if I don't look out. I wish
LINE 292: Melville's fine gentleman visitor farther!"
LINE 293: Mrs. Falconer spoke rapidly, and in rather a high key. Her accent was
LINE 294: decidedly provincial, and she did not measure out her words with the
LINE 295: slow precision which her eldest son Melville considered a mark of _bon
LINE 296: ton_.
LINE 297: Mrs. Falconer was the daughter of a large farmer in a neighbouring
LINE 298: county, and the squire had married her in haste, though he had never
LINE 299: repented at leisure.
LINE 300: She was thoroughly loyal-hearted and true as a wife and mother; brusque
LINE 301: and blunt, holding all fine things and fine people in supreme contempt.
LINE 302: And yet, according to the perversity of women-kind, she spoiled and
LINE 303: indulged the son whose love of fine things seemed likely to be his bane,
LINE 304: and brought perpetual trouble upon his good and honourable father.
LINE 305: To make bread and cakes, to skim milk, churn butter, at a pinch, and
LINE 306: make all the sweet, cooling drinks for the summer, and elderberry wine
LINE 307: for the winter, were domestic duties in which Mrs. Falconer gloried. She
LINE 308: would put on a large apron and a pair of dusting-gloves every morning
LINE 309: and go the round of the parlours, and rub the old mahogany chair-backs
LINE 310: and bureau with vigour, sprinkle the tea-leaves on stated days, and
LINE 311: follow one of her stout maid-servants, as they swept the carpets on
LINE 312: their knees, with dustpan and brush, and remove every suspicion of
LINE 313: "fluff" from every corner or crevice where it might be supposed to
LINE 314: accumulate.
LINE 315: While her children were young these household duties which their mother
LINE 316: took upon herself, were considered as a matter of course, but with added
LINE 317: years came added wisdom, to some of them at least, and Melville, her
LINE 318: eldest son, and her great darling and idol, began to show unmistakable
LINE 319: signs of annoyance, at his mother's household accomplishments.
LINE 320: He was at home now, and a stormy scene the night before had deepened the
LINE 321: lines on the squire's brow; and hard things Melville had said were as
LINE 322: sharp swords to his mother's soul. She was not particularly sensitive,
LINE 323: it is true; by no means thin-skinned, or laying herself out--as is the
LINE 324: fashion of some women of her temperament, to take offence. Still,
LINE 325: Melville had succeeded the night before in wounding her in her tenderest
LINE 326: place, reminding her that while his father's pedigree could be stretched
LINE 327: out to meet the royal blood of the Saxon kings, the race of sturdy
LINE 328: yeomen, from which his mother came, had no blue blood in their veins and
LINE 329: were sons of the soil.
LINE 330: There is an old saying that "sharper than a serpent's tooth is an
LINE 331: ungrateful child;" and Mrs. Falconer was still smarting from the wound
LINE 332: given her the evening before, when she began to dispense the excellent
LINE 333: breakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which
LINE 334: was connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.
LINE 335: The squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed
LINE 336: beef and drank his glass of "home-brew" in silence. He professed to be
LINE 337: engrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite
LINE 338: conversation.
LINE 339: Piers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his
LINE 340: appetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a
LINE 341: great appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions
LINE 342: nowadays.
LINE 343: Tea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those
LINE 344: times; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her
LINE 345: father a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which
LINE 346: Mrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating
LINE 347: with it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed
LINE 348: when the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.
LINE 349: "So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?" Mrs. Falconer
LINE 350: said when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the
LINE 351: plates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip
LINE 352: and Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in
LINE 353: a state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and
LINE 354: their eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress
LINE 355: presided.
LINE 356: The noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided
LINE 357: movement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside
LINE 358: on their hind legs as Joyce called out: "Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!" and
LINE 359: then, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,
LINE 360: the plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a
LINE 361: twinkling.
LINE 362: "Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o'clock?" Mr. Falconer asked
LINE 363: as he left the room.
LINE 364: Joyce was silent, and her mother said:
LINE 365: "Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I
LINE 366: want." Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden
LINE 367: bowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.
LINE 368: She had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door
LINE 369: opened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous
LINE 370: in the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was
LINE 371: as near perfection as possible.
LINE 372: His hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead
LINE 373: and round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much
LINE 374: care, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,
LINE 375: very short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with
LINE 376: a wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an
LINE 377: edge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set
LINE 378: off a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles
LINE 379: by straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile
LINE 380: imitators of "the first gentleman in Europe" followed in his steps with
LINE 381: as much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to
LINE 382: let the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon
LINE 383: ton_ looked like.
LINE 384: Melville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of
LINE 385: the interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up
LINE 386: his own wishes for the sake of another in his life.
LINE 387: He had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt
LINE 388: for what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of
LINE 389: superior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,
LINE 390: who, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard
LINE 391: on the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.
LINE 392: The great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when
LINE 393: railway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the
LINE 394: large ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;
LINE 395: the tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to
LINE 396: be rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time
LINE 397: of comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to
LINE 398: bear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered
LINE 399: strength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay
LINE 400: outside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not
LINE 401: ignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest
LINE 402: that change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,
LINE 403: had been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her
LINE 404: neighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make
LINE 405: the acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read
LINE 406: and write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had
LINE 407: enough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to
LINE 408: arithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and
LINE 409: she, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. "A pack of
LINE 410: nonsense," she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only
LINE 411: she had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the
LINE 412: table, when her son entered.
LINE 413: "Breakfast!" she exclaimed. "No, indeed; breakfast is over and done
LINE 414: with. I can't keep the things about half the morning."
LINE 415: The prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the
LINE 416: table, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:
LINE 417: "Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;
LINE 418: and let the eggs be poached; and----"
LINE 419: But Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:
LINE 420: "No," she said; "your sister has something else to do than wait on you.
LINE 421: I'll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve
LINE 422: you right; lie-a-beds don't generally have sharp appetites."
LINE 423: "Nay, mother," Melville said, "do not let the want of appetite be laid
LINE 424: to my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this
LINE 425: morning. And I beseech you, do not do servant's work for _me_."
LINE 426: Mrs. Falconer's face betrayed that she felt the thrust.
LINE 427: "Servant's work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for
LINE 428: themselves," she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and
LINE 429: repaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for
LINE 430: her son.
LINE 431: Joyce hesitated a moment, and then said:
LINE 432: "It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would
LINE 433: get up earlier."
LINE 434: "My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at
LINE 435: six. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I
LINE 436: desire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you
LINE 437: know, when I come into the place."
LINE 438: "Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know
LINE 439: everything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you
LINE 440: at Oxford was wasted."
LINE 441: "Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But
LINE 442: to speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a
LINE 443: week. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He
LINE 444: arrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my
LINE 445: father, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out."
LINE 446: "I hope he is not a fine gentleman," Joyce said.
LINE 447: "He is a very fine gentleman indeed," was the answer; "and, Joyce,
LINE 448: persuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like
LINE 449: a housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his
LINE 450: element."
LINE 451: "If he is to feel that, what does he come for?" Joyce said, angrily. "We
LINE 452: want no upstarts here."
LINE 453: "Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest
LINE 454: families in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as
LINE 455: if we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect."
LINE 456: "Respect!" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. "Respect! As if father were not
LINE 457: respected as a justice! and as if _you_----" Joyce stopped; she felt too
LINE 458: indignant to go on.
LINE 459: "My dear little sister," Melville said, with a grand air of pity--"my
LINE 460: dear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of
LINE 461: the habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so
LINE 462: foolishly."
LINE 463: "I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits
LINE 464: from associating with them."
LINE 465: Melville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.
LINE 466: "My dear," he said, "facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike
LINE 467: you, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the
LINE 468: county, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not
LINE 469: invited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the
LINE 470: usages of _genteel_ life."
LINE 471: Melville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in
LINE 472: those days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more
LINE 473: significant, though generally accepted--"Good form," "A 1," and so
LINE 474: forth.
LINE 475: "It is," Melville continued, grandly, "the result of early associations;
LINE 476: and so we eat heavy one o'clock meals and nine o'clock suppers, instead
LINE 477: of dining at three or four o'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving
LINE 478: company in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my
LINE 479: dear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I
LINE 480: advise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine
LINE 481: at a less outlandish hour, and I----"
LINE 482: Whatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She
LINE 483: left the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,
LINE 484: bearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her
LINE 485: son, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been
LINE 486: better without them.
LINE 487: "Thank you, mother," Melville said. "I hope the toast is not dried up.
LINE 488: There is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg."
LINE 489: "There are two ways of doing everything," was Mrs. Falconer's rejoinder.
LINE 490: "Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs."
LINE 491: "Why should you have work, mother?"
LINE 492: "Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that
LINE 493: question. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid
LINE 494: before the fire."
LINE 495: "A fire in this weather!" exclaimed Melville.
LINE 496: "No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while
LINE 497: I am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is
LINE 498: not one to scoff at plain people."
LINE 499: "Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all
LINE 500: that, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that
LINE 501: we should dine at four o'clock while he is here, and that the boys
LINE 502: should not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great
LINE 503: houses."
LINE 504: "It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a
LINE 505: comfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,
LINE 506: and no show. I'll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed
LINE 507: nor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as
LINE 508: lavender can make them, and----"
LINE 509: Melville shrugged his shoulders.
LINE 510: "Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of
LINE 511: bed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all
LINE 512: things wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the
LINE 513: mistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and
LINE 514: comely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little
LINE 515: feminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red
LINE 516: ant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,
LINE 517: mother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here."
LINE 518: Mrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily
LINE 519: despatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the
LINE 520: larder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.
LINE 521: "Disgusting!" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with
LINE 522: a leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. "It is enough to make one
LINE 523: sick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my
LINE 524: breakfast, before I start."
LINE 525: Mrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was
LINE 526: in the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself
LINE 527: to a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to
LINE 528: mount the "four-wheel" and drive into Wells.
