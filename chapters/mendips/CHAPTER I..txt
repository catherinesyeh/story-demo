LINE 29: PREFACE
LINE 30: I am greatly indebted to that very interesting book, "Bristol Past and
LINE 31: Present," for the details of the Bristol Riots, in the autumn of 1831,
LINE 32: which are introduced into this story. It closes with the birth of the
LINE 33: new year, 1832; and therefore the special commission appointed to try
LINE 34: the prisoners does not come within its limits.
LINE 35: But anyone who may be interested in the fate of Colonel Brereton, may,
LINE 36: by referring to "Bristol Past and Present," and other contemporary
LINE 37: records, learn his sad and most lamentable end.
LINE 38: Feeling the evidence of the Court Martial was entirely against him, he
LINE 39: forestalled his sentence with his own hand, and shot himself through the
LINE 40: heart, on Thursday night, January the 14th, 1832.
LINE 41: With all the many complications of Colonel Brereton's position it is not
LINE 42: for us to deal, nor judge him harshly for apparent failure in duty at a
LINE 43: time when the hearts of many brave men sank within them, for looking on
LINE 44: these things which were coming on their ancient city. But this, his
LINE 45: last act, must ever awaken one of the saddest memories of those sad
LINE 46: times, casting a shadow over the name of an English officer, and
LINE 47: presenting the most painful and pathetic picture of what a man may do,
LINE 48: who, in a moment of despair and helplessness, cannot cry to the strong
LINE 49: for strength.

LINE 81: CHAPTER I.
LINE 82: FAIR ACRES.
LINE 83: It was a fair morning of early summer, when the low beams of the eastern
LINE 84: sun, threw flickering shadows across the lawn, which lay before Fair
LINE 85: Acres Manor, nestling under the shelter of the Mendip Hills, somewhere
LINE 86: between Wells and Cheddar.
LINE 87: Truth compels me to say, that the lawn was covered with daisies, and
LINE 88: that their bright eyes looked fearlessly up into the blue sky; for
LINE 89: mowing machines were unknown, and the old gardener, coachman, and
LINE 90: universal out-of-door servant sharpened his scythe, only at long
LINE 91: intervals, to lay the heads of the flowers low, so that the daisies grew
LINE 92: and flourished, and had a good time of it.
LINE 93: I know that daisy-speckled turf is considered an offence in the eyes of
LINE 94: the modern gardener. I know with what zeal the spud is used; how large
LINE 95: bare places are regarded with delight; how seed is scattered over them,
LINE 96: which the birds watch with cunning glances from the neighbouring shrubs
LINE 97: and trees, and pounce down upon, as soon as the diligent master of the
LINE 98: place, has straightened his aching back and turned it upon the scene of
LINE 99: his labours.
LINE 100: The dewy lawn before Fair Acres, with its beautiful mosaic of white and
LINE 101: gold, fringed with circles of deepest crimson here and there, would not
LINE 102: suit the taste of the conventional gardener of these days; nor would the
LINE 103: low, irregular building which overlooked it, be considered an attractive
LINE 104: or fitting residence, for the sons and daughters of the small country
LINE 105: squire in the ninth decade of the century.
LINE 106: But in the second decade, in which my story opens, things were
LINE 107: different. The country squire lived a country life. He farmed his own
LINE 108: acres, he walked over his own fields; his 'stock' were individual cows
LINE 109: and horses to him; he could pat each one and call it by its name. His
LINE 110: house was his home, and the restlessness of travel, and longing for
LINE 111: excitement had not as yet, for the most part, disturbed either him or
LINE 112: his children.
LINE 113: Now the resonant steam eagle, as it flies across the country side, seems
LINE 114: to call upon the dwellers in rural districts to follow where it leads,
LINE 115: and an isolated manorial farm like Fair Acres, and a family like the
LINE 116: Falconers who inhabited it, are all but impossible to find nowadays.
LINE 117: Nor would we grumble that the stream of Progress bears us all upon its
LINE 118: breast with the strong resistless current, of which we are scarcely
LINE 119: conscious. The busy rush of life has its brighter side, for there are
LINE 120: wider fields of service opened out for our sons, and the selfishness
LINE 121: which was apt to spring from a secluded life in the heart of the hills,
LINE 122: is counteracted by contact with many men, and many minds. Human sympathy
LINE 123: is quickened, and love is drawn forth, and the labourers who long for
LINE 124: work in the harvest field have the way made easy for them; tools are put
LINE 125: into the hands of our daughters with which they may, if they will, carve
LINE 126: their own lot in life, and none can complain now that life is wasted for
LINE 127: lack of opportunity, for opportunities start up on every side in this
LINE 128: active, zealous, go-a-head age in which we find ourselves.
LINE 129: But in spite of all such advantages and due acknowledgment of their
LINE 130: value, it is refreshing to turn to quiet and peaceful habitations like
LINE 131: Fair Acres, and live again a quieter and less complex life than that
LINE 132: which we have grown to believe is necessary in these later times.
LINE 133: As the sun threw its level beams from the east across the lawn,
LINE 134: thousands of diamond drops sparkled and shimmered in the light, and it
LINE 135: touched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a
LINE 136: white gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,
LINE 137: behind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.
LINE 138: Joyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to
LINE 139: look back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.
LINE 140: A peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose
LINE 141: against a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few
LINE 142: cottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three
LINE 143: farms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at
LINE 144: a higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature
LINE 145: Cheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open
LINE 146: country, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble
LINE 147: cathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful
LINE 148: cathedral village of Wells.
LINE 149: Joyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly
LINE 150: landscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her
LINE 151: father called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,
LINE 152: who was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of
LINE 153: fancy, would say, "Joyce is the child's name; and what can suit her
LINE 154: better? I don't like nick-names."
LINE 155: Nevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the
LINE 156: white gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:
LINE 157: "Hallo, Sunshine!"
LINE 158: "Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning."
LINE 159: The squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart
LINE 160: man, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up
LINE 161: to his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from
LINE 162: any idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with
LINE 163: sedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large
LINE 164: retriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about
LINE 165: in every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally
LINE 166: turning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though
LINE 167: accompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.
LINE 168: "I am up first to-day, daddy!" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the
LINE 169: gentle descent and linked her arm in her father's. "I am first, and is
LINE 170: not it beautiful to be alive on such a day?"
LINE 171: The squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter's waist, he
LINE 172: said, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:
LINE 173: "Beautiful! yes," thinking, though he did not say so, that the most
LINE 174: beautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his
LINE 175: darling Joyce.
LINE 176: "I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay," he said; "but the glass
LINE 177: went up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this
LINE 178: morning."
LINE 179: "When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?"
LINE 180: "To-morrow, in the home meadow," was the reply. "I am going into Wells
LINE 181: to-day, for the magistrates' meeting."
LINE 182: "May I come, father?"
LINE 183: "Well, I've no objection, if mother has not," was the answer. "You must
LINE 184: ask her leave."
LINE 185: "I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;
LINE 186: and you don't like commissions at shops, daddy."
LINE 187: The squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the
LINE 188: two began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on
LINE 189: the side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the
LINE 190: light step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in
LINE 191: the highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.
LINE 192: As she stood there in the light of the morning, Joyce Falconer was a
LINE 193: fair picture of happy, joyous maidenhood. Her figure was lithe and
LINE 194: supple, and though I am afraid her lilac cotton frock would be despised
LINE 195: as only fit for a maid-servant in these days, it became her well. It was
LINE 196: made with a full skirt and a loose body, cut rather low at the neck,
LINE 197: with sleeves which were large on the shoulder, gradually tightening to
LINE 198: the wrist, and displayed to advantage a well-rounded arm. Joyce's shoes
LINE 199: were thick; but though, perhaps, a trifle clumsy, they did not spoil the
LINE 200: symmetry of her pretty ankle and high-arched instep. Snowy "tuckers" of
LINE 201: crimped muslin were sewn into the neck and wrists of her gown, and she
LINE 202: wore an apron with a bib; an old-fashioned apron, guiltless of bows or
LINE 203: lace.
LINE 204: Her abundant chestnut hair was gathered on the top of her small head,
LINE 205: and fell in curls on either side of her smooth white brow; not concealed
LINE 206: now by the large Dunstable straw bonnet, which was hanging to her arm by
LINE 207: the strings, and left the gentle breeze of the morning free, to play
LINE 208: amongst the clustering curls, at their own sweet will.
LINE 209: Joyce's features were regular, and her complexion rosy and healthy.
LINE 210: Indeed, everything about her seemed to tell of youth and the full
LINE 211: enjoyment of the gifts which God had given her.
LINE 212: "A perfect little rustic!" her aunt in the Vicar's close at Wells called
LINE 213: her sometimes, and would suggest to her father that a year or two at a
LINE 214: "finishing school" would be an advantage.
LINE 215: But the squire could not bring himself to part from his only daughter,
LINE 216: and her education had been, I am afraid, sadly neglected.
LINE 217: "Well, little one," Mr. Falconer said, as he seated himself on a rough
LINE 218: wooden bench, "what is this?" touching the cover of a book that peeped
LINE 219: from her apron pocket.
LINE 220: "It is a book, father, Charlotte lent me: Mrs. Hemans' poems."
LINE 221: "Ah! poetry is a good thing when it is kept in its right place."
LINE 222: "I have been learning a long poem called 'Edith,' and I repeat it when I
LINE 223: am darning stockings, picking up a stitch for every word. Don't you
LINE 224: understand, father?"
LINE 225: "I never darned a stocking," he said, laughing.
LINE 226: "Ah! happy father! Mother has now given me six pairs of Melville's new
LINE 227: socks, to strengthen the heels. In and out, in and out with the long
LINE 228: needle; I have to try very hard not to grumble, so I say 'Edith' as a
LINE 229: comfort, and to help me on."
LINE 230: 'The woods--oh! solemn are the boundless woods
LINE 231: Of the great Western world when day declines,
LINE 232: And louder sounds the roll of distant floods,
LINE 233: More deep the rustling of the solemn pines;
LINE 234: When darkness gathers o'er the stilly air,
LINE 235: And mystery seems o'er every leaf to brood,
LINE 236: Awful it is for human heart to bear
LINE 237: The weight and burden of the solitude.'
LINE 238: "Father," she said, suddenly stopping, "you are thinking of something
LINE 239: that troubles you. I know it by the deep line on your forehead, between
LINE 240: your eyes. May I know, father?"
LINE 241: "Well, Sunshine, I am troubled about Melville; he wants to go and see
LINE 242: the world, he says. I have given him as good an education as befits his
LINE 243: station in life. He has made little use of it; and the bills for the
LINE 244: last term at Oxford have been enormous."
LINE 245: "How shameful!" Joyce exclaimed.
LINE 246: "Things are so different from what they were when I was a boy," the
LINE 247: squire said. "Why, I never dreamed of anything beyond doing my duty
LINE 248: here. I took the farming business off your grandfather's shoulders
LINE 249: before I was five-and-twenty. I was his steward, as Melville ought to be
LINE 250: mine, and leave me free. As it is, I have to pay Watson, and look into
LINE 251: everything myself, when I have a son of three-and-twenty, who ought to
LINE 252: do all this for me. I suppose it can't be helped," the squire said,
LINE 253: stretching out his legs, and taking up the gun which had been resting
LINE 254: against the bench, "and as far as I can see the younger boys will be
LINE 255: very little, if any, better than Melville."
LINE 256: "Oh! yes, father. Ralph will do anything you wish, I know; and Hal and
LINE 257: Bunny are very good at school. Remember what the master said of them at
LINE 258: Christmas."
LINE 259: "Yes, yes; they are good little fellows. Then there is poor Piers; he
LINE 260: must always be an anxiety, poor boy!"
LINE 261: "I don't think any of us can be happier than Piers," Joyce said. "He
LINE 262: never complains because he is lame; and he is as contented as possible,
LINE 263: making his collection of moths and butterflies, and bird's eggs, and
LINE 264: things. No, father, don't be unhappy about Piers."
LINE 265: "Do you think, Joyce, I ever forget that it was my carelessness which
LINE 266: made the boy a cripple? I never forget it."
LINE 267: "No one else thinks of it, dear daddy," Joyce said, slipping her hand
LINE 268: into her father's, as it rested on his knee. "No one else thinks of it;
LINE 269: and you know the colt had been broken in, and----"
LINE 270: "The child ought never to have put his legs across it, Joyce; and I
LINE 271: lifted him on, and told him not to be a coward. Ah!" said the squire,
LINE 272: suddenly starting to his feet. "I cannot speak of it; I dare not."
LINE 273: He began an abrupt descent the way that they had come. Nip and Pip, who
LINE 274: had been sleeping with their noses on their paws, and one eye open,
LINE 275: raced off, while Duke drew himself into a standing position, and walked
LINE 276: demurely down the steep bit of turf, with the brush of his tail waving
LINE 277: from side to side as he went.
LINE 278: Joyce did not follow immediately. Her bright face was clouded with the
LINE 279: sympathy she felt for her father. It all came back to her: the group
LINE 280: before the Manor, the child of eight years old, saying, "I am afraid of
LINE 281: riding Rioter, father." Then the father's answer, "Afraid! Don't be a
LINE 282: coward, Piers; you have a good seat enough for such a little chap. Here,
LINE 283: let me put you on." The boy's white, set face, as he grasped the reins;
LINE 284: and Rioter was off like lightning. "His brothers rode long before they
LINE 285: were his age," the squire had said; "it won't do to tie him to his
LINE 286: mother's apron strings, because he happens to be the youngest." Then the
LINE 287: sound of returning horse's feet, and Rioter rushed up the side drive to
LINE 288: the stables riderless. Another minute and old Thomas appeared with a
LINE 289: lifeless burden in his arms, which the squire took from him, with a
LINE 290: groan of remorse, as he turned into the house with him and said to his
LINE 291: wife, "I have killed the boy."
LINE 292: But Piers was not killed. His injuries were life-long, but his life was
LINE 293: spared.
LINE 294: Whether it was from an instinctive feeling, that his father considered
LINE 295: himself the cause of his lameness and generally invalided condition, or
LINE 296: whether the latent buoyancy of his nature asserted itself above all the
LINE 297: privations which the accident had brought upon him, or whether both of
LINE 298: these causes were at work within him, certain it is that Piers was the
LINE 299: most cheerful and most uncomplaining member of the squire's household,
LINE 300: and never allowed any one to pity him, or to treat him as an object of
LINE 301: compassion. Joyce was right when she said that no one was happier than
LINE 302: Piers. Every bird and insect had a charm for him, and were his friends
LINE 303: and companions. Books of natural history were rare; but Bewick's Birds
LINE 304: sufficed for Piers' needs. The "Natural History of Selborne" and old
LINE 305: Isaak Walton's "Angler" were also amongst the boy's scanty library, and
LINE 306: keen perception and acute observation supplied the place of extraneous
LINE 307: help; and Piers was content.
LINE 308: The cloud soon cleared from Joyce's face as a well-known whistle was
LINE 309: heard from the copse, and Joyce answered it with a clear note of
LINE 310: welcome:
LINE 311: "Here, Piers."
LINE 312: Then the quick, even thud of crutches, and Piers came in sight.
LINE 313: In a moment Joyce was springing down the grassy hill-side, and, with a
LINE 314: hardly perceptible touch on her brother's shoulder, she joined him as he
LINE 315: came up.
LINE 316: "I say, Joyce, if you go to Wells to-day with father, will you take this
LINE 317: little sparrow-hawk to old Plume's to be stuffed? Here, rummage in my
LINE 318: pocket, left-hand side--there he is! He is a perfect specimen, and a
LINE 319: pretty rare one. The stable-boy found him lying on his back under the
LINE 320: dove-cot. Perhaps he got the worst of it in a fight. Anyhow, he is dead,
LINE 321: and I have a nice nook for him in my big case."
LINE 322: "Poor dear little birdie," Joyce said, stroking the soft feathers. "Oh!
LINE 323: Piers, why must everything die? It seems so hard. And this is the
LINE 324: puzzle, that we--you and I--may die to-day, next week, any day; and yet
LINE 325: we don't really behave as if we believed it. I feel on a morning like
LINE 326: this, for instance, so full of life, it is so delicious to live, and as
LINE 327: if I never could die. It is so beautiful to be living, so sad to be
LINE 328: dead! To think, Piers, of this little bird singing sweetly----"
LINE 329: "Sparrow-hawks don't sing very sweetly; they chirrup and whistle," Piers
LINE 330: interrupted.
LINE 331: "Ah, well, he thought he sang sweetly, and so did his mother; so it came
LINE 332: to the same thing. Poor little sweet." And Joyce held the little
LINE 333: lifeless bird against her rounded chin and pressed her lips upon it.
LINE 334: Suddenly Piers said:
LINE 335: "What is wrong about Melville; there's something fresh, for I heard my
LINE 336: mother talking about it before I was up."
LINE 337: "He says he won't come here and take care of the farm. He wants to
LINE 338: travel."
LINE 339: "Well, I don't blame him for that," said Piers.
LINE 340: "But his debts have hampered father dreadfully I know, and he does so
LINE 341: detest his fine gentleman airs. It seems to me," said Joyce, vehemently,
LINE 342: "to be ashamed of a father like ours is--Oh! I have no word bad enough,
LINE 343: and Melville _is_ ashamed, and he does not like mother looking after the
LINE 344: dairy and the butter."
LINE 345: "Well," said Piers, tapping his crutch upon the ground, "I think mother
LINE 346: does fidget and worry too much in the house and about the place; but it
LINE 347: is her way, and no one could alter it."
LINE 348: "I don't know that I wish to alter it," Joyce said, hotly. "Mother has
LINE 349: done so much for us, and I hate to think she is slighted by her
LINE 350: children. Melville _does_ slight her, and when he talks in that
LINE 351: drawling, affected voice, and ties his starched cravats twenty times,
LINE 352: and flings them down again if the bow is crooked. I despise _him_, and
LINE 353: that is the truth."
LINE 354: Piers shrugged his shoulders.
LINE 355: "Well, we must go back to breakfast," he said; "I am hungry, and it must
LINE 356: be nearly eight o'clock."
LINE 357: The brother and sister walked slowly towards the house, and as they
LINE 358: crossed the lawn, from which the sun had kissed away all the dewdrops, a
LINE 359: bell over the stables rang, and a little alert figure appeared in the
LINE 360: porch.
LINE 361: "Joyce, Joyce! What are you dawdling for? It is past eight o'clock.
LINE 362: Getting your feet drenched with the dew, I'll warrant. No, don't bring
LINE 363: any dead birds here, Piers; I won't have it. The house is just like a
LINE 364: pigsty with all your rubbish. Take it round to the back kitchen. I have
LINE 365: a pretty hard morning's work before me, and you must lend a hand, Joyce,
LINE 366: I can tell you."
LINE 367: "Father said I was to go with him to Wells, mother, and do your
LINE 368: shopping."
LINE 369: "Well, that won't be till eleven o'clock. There's time enough first to
LINE 370: help me to give out the stores and get the linen aired for the boys'
LINE 371: room and the spare bedroom, and you forget, I suppose, that your
LINE 372: brothers are coming home for the holidays on Friday, and this is
LINE 373: Wednesday. I shall be all behindhand, if I don't look out. I wish
LINE 374: Melville's fine gentleman visitor farther!"
LINE 375: Mrs. Falconer spoke rapidly, and in rather a high key. Her accent was
LINE 376: decidedly provincial, and she did not measure out her words with the
LINE 377: slow precision which her eldest son Melville considered a mark of _bon
LINE 378: ton_.
LINE 379: Mrs. Falconer was the daughter of a large farmer in a neighbouring
LINE 380: county, and the squire had married her in haste, though he had never
LINE 381: repented at leisure.
LINE 382: She was thoroughly loyal-hearted and true as a wife and mother; brusque
LINE 383: and blunt, holding all fine things and fine people in supreme contempt.
LINE 384: And yet, according to the perversity of women-kind, she spoiled and
LINE 385: indulged the son whose love of fine things seemed likely to be his bane,
LINE 386: and brought perpetual trouble upon his good and honourable father.
LINE 387: To make bread and cakes, to skim milk, churn butter, at a pinch, and
LINE 388: make all the sweet, cooling drinks for the summer, and elderberry wine
LINE 389: for the winter, were domestic duties in which Mrs. Falconer gloried. She
LINE 390: would put on a large apron and a pair of dusting-gloves every morning
LINE 391: and go the round of the parlours, and rub the old mahogany chair-backs
LINE 392: and bureau with vigour, sprinkle the tea-leaves on stated days, and
LINE 393: follow one of her stout maid-servants, as they swept the carpets on
LINE 394: their knees, with dustpan and brush, and remove every suspicion of
LINE 395: "fluff" from every corner or crevice where it might be supposed to
LINE 396: accumulate.
LINE 397: While her children were young these household duties which their mother
LINE 398: took upon herself, were considered as a matter of course, but with added
LINE 399: years came added wisdom, to some of them at least, and Melville, her
LINE 400: eldest son, and her great darling and idol, began to show unmistakable
LINE 401: signs of annoyance, at his mother's household accomplishments.
LINE 402: He was at home now, and a stormy scene the night before had deepened the
LINE 403: lines on the squire's brow; and hard things Melville had said were as
LINE 404: sharp swords to his mother's soul. She was not particularly sensitive,
LINE 405: it is true; by no means thin-skinned, or laying herself out--as is the
LINE 406: fashion of some women of her temperament, to take offence. Still,
LINE 407: Melville had succeeded the night before in wounding her in her tenderest
LINE 408: place, reminding her that while his father's pedigree could be stretched
LINE 409: out to meet the royal blood of the Saxon kings, the race of sturdy
LINE 410: yeomen, from which his mother came, had no blue blood in their veins and
LINE 411: were sons of the soil.
LINE 412: There is an old saying that "sharper than a serpent's tooth is an
LINE 413: ungrateful child;" and Mrs. Falconer was still smarting from the wound
LINE 414: given her the evening before, when she began to dispense the excellent
LINE 415: breakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which
LINE 416: was connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.
LINE 417: The squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed
LINE 418: beef and drank his glass of "home-brew" in silence. He professed to be
LINE 419: engrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite
LINE 420: conversation.
LINE 421: Piers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his
LINE 422: appetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a
LINE 423: great appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions
LINE 424: nowadays.
LINE 425: Tea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those
LINE 426: times; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her
LINE 427: father a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which
LINE 428: Mrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating
LINE 429: with it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed
LINE 430: when the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.
LINE 431: "So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?" Mrs. Falconer
LINE 432: said when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the
LINE 433: plates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip
LINE 434: and Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in
LINE 435: a state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and
LINE 436: their eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress
LINE 437: presided.
LINE 438: The noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided
LINE 439: movement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside
LINE 440: on their hind legs as Joyce called out: "Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!" and
LINE 441: then, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,
LINE 442: the plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a
LINE 443: twinkling.
LINE 444: "Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o'clock?" Mr. Falconer asked
LINE 445: as he left the room.
LINE 446: Joyce was silent, and her mother said:
LINE 447: "Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I
LINE 448: want." Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden
LINE 449: bowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.
LINE 450: She had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door
LINE 451: opened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous
LINE 452: in the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was
LINE 453: as near perfection as possible.
LINE 454: His hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead
LINE 455: and round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much
LINE 456: care, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,
LINE 457: very short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with
LINE 458: a wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an
LINE 459: edge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set
LINE 460: off a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles
LINE 461: by straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile
LINE 462: imitators of "the first gentleman in Europe" followed in his steps with
LINE 463: as much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to
LINE 464: let the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon
LINE 465: ton_ looked like.
LINE 466: Melville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of
LINE 467: the interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up
LINE 468: his own wishes for the sake of another in his life.
LINE 469: He had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt
LINE 470: for what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of
LINE 471: superior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,
LINE 472: who, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard
LINE 473: on the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.
LINE 474: The great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when
LINE 475: railway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the
LINE 476: large ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;
LINE 477: the tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to
LINE 478: be rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time
LINE 479: of comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to
LINE 480: bear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered
LINE 481: strength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay
LINE 482: outside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not
LINE 483: ignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest
LINE 484: that change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,
LINE 485: had been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her
LINE 486: neighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make
LINE 487: the acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read
LINE 488: and write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had
LINE 489: enough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to
LINE 490: arithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and
LINE 491: she, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. "A pack of
LINE 492: nonsense," she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only
LINE 493: she had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the
LINE 494: table, when her son entered.
LINE 495: "Breakfast!" she exclaimed. "No, indeed; breakfast is over and done
LINE 496: with. I can't keep the things about half the morning."
LINE 497: The prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the
LINE 498: table, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:
LINE 499: "Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;
LINE 500: and let the eggs be poached; and----"
LINE 501: But Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:
LINE 502: "No," she said; "your sister has something else to do than wait on you.
LINE 503: I'll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve
LINE 504: you right; lie-a-beds don't generally have sharp appetites."
LINE 505: "Nay, mother," Melville said, "do not let the want of appetite be laid
LINE 506: to my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this
LINE 507: morning. And I beseech you, do not do servant's work for _me_."
LINE 508: Mrs. Falconer's face betrayed that she felt the thrust.
LINE 509: "Servant's work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for
LINE 510: themselves," she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and
LINE 511: repaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for
LINE 512: her son.
LINE 513: Joyce hesitated a moment, and then said:
LINE 514: "It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would
LINE 515: get up earlier."
LINE 516: "My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at
LINE 517: six. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I
LINE 518: desire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you
LINE 519: know, when I come into the place."
LINE 520: "Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know
LINE 521: everything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you
LINE 522: at Oxford was wasted."
LINE 523: "Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But
LINE 524: to speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a
LINE 525: week. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He
LINE 526: arrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my
LINE 527: father, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out."
LINE 528: "I hope he is not a fine gentleman," Joyce said.
LINE 529: "He is a very fine gentleman indeed," was the answer; "and, Joyce,
LINE 530: persuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like
LINE 531: a housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his
LINE 532: element."
LINE 533: "If he is to feel that, what does he come for?" Joyce said, angrily. "We
LINE 534: want no upstarts here."
LINE 535: "Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest
LINE 536: families in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as
LINE 537: if we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect."
LINE 538: "Respect!" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. "Respect! As if father were not
LINE 539: respected as a justice! and as if _you_----" Joyce stopped; she felt too
LINE 540: indignant to go on.
LINE 541: "My dear little sister," Melville said, with a grand air of pity--"my
LINE 542: dear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of
LINE 543: the habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so
LINE 544: foolishly."
LINE 545: "I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits
LINE 546: from associating with them."
LINE 547: Melville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.
LINE 548: "My dear," he said, "facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike
LINE 549: you, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the
LINE 550: county, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not
LINE 551: invited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the
LINE 552: usages of _genteel_ life."
LINE 553: Melville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in
LINE 554: those days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more
LINE 555: significant, though generally accepted--"Good form," "A 1," and so
LINE 556: forth.
LINE 557: "It is," Melville continued, grandly, "the result of early associations;
LINE 558: and so we eat heavy one o'clock meals and nine o'clock suppers, instead
LINE 559: of dining at three or four o'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving
LINE 560: company in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my
LINE 561: dear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I
LINE 562: advise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine
LINE 563: at a less outlandish hour, and I----"
LINE 564: Whatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She
LINE 565: left the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,
LINE 566: bearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her
LINE 567: son, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been
LINE 568: better without them.
LINE 569: "Thank you, mother," Melville said. "I hope the toast is not dried up.
LINE 570: There is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg."
LINE 571: "There are two ways of doing everything," was Mrs. Falconer's rejoinder.
LINE 572: "Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs."
LINE 573: "Why should you have work, mother?"
LINE 574: "Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that
LINE 575: question. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid
LINE 576: before the fire."
LINE 577: "A fire in this weather!" exclaimed Melville.
LINE 578: "No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while
LINE 579: I am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is
LINE 580: not one to scoff at plain people."
LINE 581: "Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all
LINE 582: that, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that
LINE 583: we should dine at four o'clock while he is here, and that the boys
LINE 584: should not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great
LINE 585: houses."
LINE 586: "It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a
LINE 587: comfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,
LINE 588: and no show. I'll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed
LINE 589: nor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as
LINE 590: lavender can make them, and----"
LINE 591: Melville shrugged his shoulders.
LINE 592: "Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of
LINE 593: bed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all
LINE 594: things wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the
LINE 595: mistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and
LINE 596: comely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little
LINE 597: feminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red
LINE 598: ant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,
LINE 599: mother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here."
LINE 600: Mrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily
LINE 601: despatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the
LINE 602: larder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.
LINE 603: "Disgusting!" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with
LINE 604: a leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. "It is enough to make one
LINE 605: sick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my
LINE 606: breakfast, before I start."
LINE 607: Mrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was
LINE 608: in the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself
LINE 609: to a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to
LINE 610: mount the "four-wheel" and drive into Wells.
