LINE 1: A DARK CLOUD OVER FAIR ACRES.
LINE 2: "How did it happen, Thomas? _Tell_ me, Thomas?"
LINE 3: "It's them Mendip fellows," he said. "The master rode to Chewton
LINE 4: yesterday, and somewhere about nine o'clock Mavis come home with no one
LINE 5: on his back. We knew summat was amiss, and we set out with lant'uns, the
LINE 6: mistress and I----"
LINE 7: "Mother went!"
LINE 8: "Yes; we couldn't keep her back. We was wandering about most of the
LINE 9: night. About eight o'clock this morning a cart comed along, and there
LINE 10: was the master brought home more dead than alive by one of farmer
LINE 11: Scott's carters."
LINE 12: "He is alive, then; oh! he is alive?"
LINE 13: "Well, yes; he was when I comed off," Thomas said, doubtfully.
LINE 14: "And why did not you come for me before? Oh! you should have sent
LINE 15: before. Oh, Thomas! Thomas!"
LINE 16: "Well," said Thomas, "we've had so much running about for doctors; and
LINE 17: Mavis ain't much good. We was short of hands and horses."
LINE 18: "Had he had a fall?" Joyce asked, "a fall from Mavis?"
LINE 19: "Aye, I dare say; but he was knocked off by a blow of a stone or summat.
LINE 20: There's a hole in his temple, just cut clean by a stone so they say."
LINE 21: "Oh, father! oh, father!" Joyce murmured.
LINE 22: "There's a lot of folks come to see after him. Mr. Paget and Squire
LINE 23: Bennett, and the Bishop's son from Wells; and there's no want of help;
LINE 24: and they'll try and hunt him out."
LINE 25: "Hunt who out?"
LINE 26: "Why, the brute that caused the master to fall off Mavis's back, of
LINE 27: course. I never did hold with master being so free riding over the
LINE 28: Mendips at late hours. I've said so scores of times--_scores_. But
LINE 29: there, he had the heart of a lion, he had."
LINE 30: _Had! had!_ How the word smote on Joyce's ear.
LINE 31: "_Has_ father--_has_--" she murmured, "he cannot, cannot be--dead!"
LINE 32: After this Joyce said no more. They went at a fair pace along the lonely
LINE 33: lanes; they passed through villages where the men were smoking pipes at
LINE 34: the cottage doors, the women standing by with babies in their arms,
LINE 35: while dusty, dirty little urchins played at "cross sticks" under the
LINE 36: very nose of the old horse. Once they passed a small farm where a
LINE 37: mother, neatly dressed, was standing at the gate, and a girl of fourteen
LINE 38: ran out to meet a man with her baby brother in her arms, who stretched
LINE 39: out his hands as the girl said:
LINE 40: "Yes, there's daddy! Go to daddy; welcome, daddy!"
LINE 41: Ah! how often had Joyce watched for her father at the gate! How her
LINE 42: heart had thrilled with joy as she ran to meet him; and now!
LINE 43: A low cry escaped her, which made Thomas turn his head, which he had
LINE 44: hitherto kept steadily to the front, as if everything depended on his
LINE 45: staring straight between the ears of the horse, and never looking to the
LINE 46: right hand, or the left.
LINE 47: Thomas was a hard featured man, who had served the old squire, and to
LINE 48: whom Mr. Falconer was still "Master Arthur." "Doan't ee fret, my dear
LINE 49: Miss Joyce. It's the hand of the Almighty."
LINE 50: Ah, _was_ it the hand of Almighty Love, the God that had so lately
LINE 51: revealed Himself to her in Christ, the All-loving as well as the
LINE 52: All-mighty--was it possible He could take away 'the master from her head
LINE 53: that day'?
LINE 54: The old servant's voice quavering with sympathy made Joyce feel that she
LINE 55: was also trembling on the brink of tears.
LINE 56: "Thomas, I want to be brave, for I shall have to comfort him and
LINE 57: mother."
LINE 58: Then there was silence again. The even jog trot of the horse's heavy
LINE 59: hoofs kept up a continuous rhythm:
LINE 60: "Home, home again; home, home again--this seemed the burden of the
LINE 61: strain--home, home again, but the same home never, never again."
LINE 62: The evening shadows were lying across the turf where the daisies had
LINE 63: closed their golden eyes for the night, when the gig turned into the
LINE 64: familiar road and drew up at the door.
LINE 65: The door was open, but there was no one there. Joyce sprang down and
LINE 66: passed in, throwing off her large bonnet, and unfastening the clasp of
LINE 67: her cloak, which seemed like to choke her.
LINE 68: In the supreme moments of life the most trivial things always seem to
LINE 69: fasten upon the outward senses, as if to show, by force of contrast, the
LINE 70: enormous proportions of the great trouble--or the great joy, it may
LINE 71: be--which is at the time overshadowing us.
LINE 72: So Joyce, as she stood in the hall, noticed that one of the stag's
LINE 73: glass eyes had dropped out and lay upon the bench upon which Gilbert
LINE 74: Arundel had sat on the night of their adventure on the moor. She saw,
LINE 75: too, lying there, a large pair of scissors, and a roll of lint lay on
LINE 76: the window-seat, with a basin in which the water was coloured a pale
LINE 77: crimson. "They bandaged his head here," she thought,--and she was going
LINE 78: upstairs, when slow, heavy, jerky footsteps were heard, and Duke came
LINE 79: down, and, putting his nose into her hand, whined a low, piteous whine.
LINE 80: "Oh! Duke, Duke, where is he?"
LINE 81: As if he understood her human speech--as, indeed, he did, Duke turned to
LINE 82: precede her upstairs.
LINE 83: On a bench in the long corridor two maid servants were seated, crying
LINE 84: bitterly. But Joyce did not speak to them, she dared not; even the
LINE 85: question she had asked Duke died on her lips.
LINE 86: The door of her father's room was ajar; and as Duke pushed it open with
LINE 87: his nose, Joyce could see the great four-post bed, her mother sitting by
LINE 88: it, and curled up in the window-seat was Piers.
LINE 89: The friends who had been there in the early part of the day were gone;
LINE 90: they could do no more at Fair Acres. And Mr. Paget's aim was to set the
LINE 91: constables to work to find the man who must have hurled a sharp stone at
LINE 92: Mr. Falconer's head. The Wells doctor, too, was gone. He had a pressing
LINE 93: case near Wells upon his hands, but he was to return at eight o'clock,
LINE 94: when, it was hoped the doctor greater than himself, who had been
LINE 95: summoned from Bristol, would have arrived.
LINE 96: In those days help in emergency was slow to obtain. Telegrams were not
LINE 97: dreamed of, and horsepower performed the part which steam was soon to
LINE 98: take up; to be followed by the marvellous electric force, which now
LINE 99: sends on the wings of the wind messages all over the world, multiplied,
LINE 100: on the very day on which I write, to an enormous extent, by the
LINE 101: introduction of sixpenny telegrams, which will send a call for help, or
LINE 102: strike a note of joy, and win an immediate response from thousands.
LINE 103: But there were no electric messages possible to get medical help for the
LINE 104: squire, nor, indeed, would any help avail.
LINE 105: With a great sigh, Duke resumed his watch at the foot of the high bed;
LINE 106: and Joyce, crossing over, kissed her mother and Piers, and then gazed
LINE 107: down upon her father.
LINE 108: "Dear dad!" she said, inadvertently using the familiar name.
LINE 109: "He has not spoken nor opened his eyes since we laid him here," Mrs.
LINE 110: Falconer said. "He knows no one--no one----"
LINE 111: "Did he tell how it happened?"
LINE 112: "No."
LINE 113: "It might have been that he was thrown from--from--Mavis."
LINE 114: "No," Mrs. Falconer said again, "that could not be, they think; besides,
LINE 115: they found a heavy stick and a tinder box close by."
LINE 116: Presently Piers came down from his place, and Joyce put her arms round
LINE 117: him. The boy was very calm, but great tears fell upon Joyce's hand as
LINE 118: she pressed him close.
LINE 119: The silent watch went on. Duke lay motionless, but his eyes were on the
LINE 120: alert. The servants looked in sometimes, and brought Joyce and her
LINE 121: mother some tea and cake. Joyce swallowed a cup of tea, but ate nothing.
LINE 122: Could this be the evening of the day which dawned so brightly?--the
LINE 123: Wrington bells chiming, the village children singing hymns, joyousness
LINE 124: and gladness everywhere. The guests gathered round Mrs. More; the
LINE 125: bright, intelligent conversation to which she was listening; then her
LINE 126: own narrative of the Mendip adventure;--and this brought her to the
LINE 127: present from the past!
LINE 128: If her father had been assailed by a malicious miner on Mendip, that
LINE 129: assailant was Bob Priday; of this she felt no doubt.
LINE 130: The Bristol doctor came, and the Wells doctor and they held a
LINE 131: consultation. But there was nothing to be done; the injury Mr. Falconer
LINE 132: had received was mortal.
LINE 133: "Will he give no sign, no word that he knows us?" Mrs. Falconer asked.
LINE 134: "Oh, for one word!"
LINE 135: "We do not think there will be any return of consciousness," the doctors
LINE 136: said, "but we cannot tell."
LINE 137: No; no one could tell. And so the sad hours of the night passed, and the
LINE 138: dawn broke over the familiar fields, and Fair Acres smiled in the first
LINE 139: bright rays of the morning.
LINE 140: Piers had slept curled up in his window-seat, worn out with grief. Mrs.
LINE 141: Falconer, too, had slept in an upright position, her head resting
LINE 142: against the back of the chair, sleeping for sorrow.
LINE 143: But Joyce did not sleep; she kept watch, hoping, praying for one word of
LINE 144: farewell.
LINE 145: As the first sunbeam slanted through the casement, her father opened his
LINE 146: eyes, and fastened them on Joyce. "Sunshine," he said, with a faint
LINE 147: smile. "Dear child."
LINE 148: "Dearest father, dear father!"
LINE 149: "I hope my little girl will be named after my mother, _Joyce_. Yes, it
LINE 150: is an old-world name, but I fancy it; name her Joyce."
LINE 151: The sound of his master's voice roused Duke, who pricked his ears and
LINE 152: came to the bedside. Mrs. Falconer also started and awoke.
LINE 153: "There is a word I cannot catch, about the _Life_. Try to think of it. I
LINE 154: can't."
LINE 155: Joyce glanced at her mother.
LINE 156: "What does he mean?" she said, helplessly. "Oh! what does he want?"
LINE 157: "The Life; I am the Life." The words came with difficulty now.
LINE 158: Then Piers, starting up, said:
LINE 159: "I know. I think I know. 'Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the
LINE 160: _Life_.'"
LINE 161: A smile of infinite content came over the father's face.
LINE 162: "_Yes_," he said. "Yes, the Life."
LINE 163: Presently he murmured Melville's name, and those of the children who had
LINE 164: gone before.
LINE 165: "The little girls all died but _one_," he said. "One is left--Sunshine."
LINE 166: They knelt down as in the presence of something unseen but near; for the
LINE 167: shadows gathered on the fine face of the husband and father; and Piers
LINE 168: repeated for the second time:
LINE 169: "Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the Life!"
LINE 170: As if with a great effort to repeat the words, the squire said, faintly,
LINE 171: "Jesus said,"--then silence fell; and the next thing Joyce knew was
LINE 172: that she was lying in her own little bed, and that she was fatherless.
LINE 173: * * * * *
LINE 174: The news of the squire's death spread quickly through the whole
LINE 175: district. As is often the case, no one knew how much he had been
LINE 176: respected till he was gone. Then there were terrible circumstances
LINE 177: connected with his death, which, apart from his loss, troubled the
LINE 178: magistrates who had sat with him on the bench, and had probably made
LINE 179: enemies, as he had done, in the performance of their duty.
LINE 180: The roads across the Mendip were avoided more than ever, and as time
LINE 181: went on and nothing was heard of or discovered about the man who had
LINE 182: thrown the missile which had caused Mr. Falconer's death; if the wonder
LINE 183: faded out, the fear remained; the county constabulary were, truth to
LINE 184: tell, afraid of their own lives, and there was no machinery of
LINE 185: detectives at work then, as now. However, whatever search was made it
LINE 186: was fruitless, and the offender had escaped beyond the reach of
LINE 187: punishment.
LINE 188: As with a sudden transition into a new state of existence, Joyce found
LINE 189: herself the central figure to whom everyone looked for help and advice.
LINE 190: Her mother collapsed utterly. She would sit for hours in that inaction,
LINE 191: which it is so painful to notice in those who have been once so full of
LINE 192: life and movement. The boys who had been sent for from school did not
LINE 193: return to it. Ralph surprised everyone by saying that he should give up
LINE 194: study, and come and live at home and help his mother--at any rate, till
LINE 195: Melville came back, if ever he did come back, to take his place at Fair
LINE 196: Acres. By interest exerted by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, Harry and
LINE 197: Bunny both got into the navy, and went forth, poor little boys, full of
LINE 198: hope and delight, to encounter the hardships which then were the
LINE 199: universal fate of little middys, in their first acquaintance with the
LINE 200: salt sea waves they loved so well.
LINE 201: It was touching to see the young brother and sister, who were left at
LINE 202: the head of affairs, resolutely doing their utmost to spare their
LINE 203: mother, and to keep things, as Mr. Watson called it, "square."
LINE 204: If he were old he was intensely useful and honourable; and Ralph's power
LINE 205: to adapt himself to his new manner of life was really wonderful. He set
LINE 206: himself to study the few and scanty agricultural books which were on his
LINE 207: father's shelves, and mastered the accounts in a way which Mr. Gell, the
LINE 208: lawyer, and Mr. Paget, the executor under the will, found to be
LINE 209: surprising.
LINE 210: Miss Falconer had sent many kind little notes on very deep black-edged
LINE 211: paper, and sealed with a large black seal, to "her dear afflicted
LINE 212: sister;" and Charlotte, who had returned from Barley Wood on the day
LINE 213: after Joyce left it, composed verses of doubtful rhythm, and still more
LINE 214: doubtful sense, which she sent, done up in brown paper parcels by the
LINE 215: carrier, as they were too voluminous to be conveyed in any other way.
LINE 216: Verses in which "bleeding hearts" and "rivers of tears," sought vainly
LINE 217: for appropriate rhymes; where "fears" refused to follow "bears," and
LINE 218: "eyes" was made to do duty again and again with "prize" and "sighs."
LINE 219: Mrs. More wrote a tender letter of sympathy to Joyce, and would have
LINE 220: driven over to see her, had not the shortening days and threatened cold
LINE 221: kept her a close prisoner. Indeed, she was laid low with one of her most
LINE 222: dangerous illnesses before September was over; and Miss Frowde and her
LINE 223: doctor thought it more than doubtful if, at her advanced age, she would
LINE 224: recover.
LINE 225: It was on a still October afternoon, when autumnal stillness reigned in
LINE 226: the woods and fields, that Joyce went to the seat under the fir trees to
LINE 227: be alone with her sorrow. The grassy slope was slippery now with recent
LINE 228: rain, and though the clouds had rolled off eastward, the sunshine was
LINE 229: pale and watery, coming in fitful gleams through the veil of thin misty
LINE 230: vapour which hung over the sky.
LINE 231: Joyce often came to this seat; it was associated with her father, and
LINE 232: she loved to be there and give full vent to the sorrow which, for the
LINE 233: sake of others, she had learned to hide. Miss Falconer and Charlotte had
LINE 234: paid one visit of condolence after the funeral. They were surprised, and
LINE 235: I may even say disappointed, to see Joyce so calm, and Miss Falconer
LINE 236: thought how different it would be with Charlotte when she was taken from
LINE 237: her; she would be entirely prostrate and unfit for exertion.
LINE 238: It is well for the world that some people are fit for exertion, even in
LINE 239: the midst of crushing sorrow. It would be a melancholy thing if all
LINE 240: grief-stricken ones fed on their grief in solitude, and shut themselves
LINE 241: up from doing their best, to lighten the burden of others.
LINE 242: Miss Falconer would not have had cause to lament Joyce's unnatural calm,
LINE 243: if she had seen her as she sat upon the old bench, in the dim, pale
LINE 244: light of the October day, when, amidst the hush of all around, her sobs
LINE 245: and low cry of "Oh! father--father," throbbed in the quiet air.
LINE 246: They had been so much to each other; they had understood each other so
LINE 247: perfectly. The beautiful tie between father and daughter, which when it
LINE 248: exists is one of the most beautiful in the world, seemed severed,
LINE 249: cruelly severed, and Joyce was desolate. She was scarcely eighteen, and
LINE 250: the freshness and gladness of her life hitherto had been remarkable.
LINE 251: Now, all unawares, the storm had swept over her sky, and, when it
LINE 252: passed, left her lonely indeed.
LINE 253: Mrs. Falconer was one of those people who bury their dead out of sight,
LINE 254: and cannot bear the mention of their names. Ralph, setting his face
LINE 255: bravely to meet his duty, did not speak of his father as Joyce would
LINE 256: have loved to speak of him, and it was only to Piers, that Joyce could
LINE 257: sometimes ease her burdened heart, by talking of her father. Just as on
LINE 258: the summer morning, now looking so far off, left in the golden haze of
LINE 259: joy and glad young life, Joyce had seen her lame brother at the gate of
LINE 260: the plantation, so she saw him now.
LINE 261: She made a great effort to control her weeping, and said:
LINE 262: "It is very slippery on the turf to-day; wait, dear, and I will come
LINE 263: down to help you." But Piers said:
LINE 264: "I want _you_ to come down; I don't want to come up."
LINE 265: "Is anything the matter?"
LINE 266: Piers did not answer, and in another minute Joyce was at his side.
LINE 267: "Joyce, there is a woman hiding under the maples and brambles."
LINE 268: "A woman? Perhaps she is one of the women employed on the farm."
LINE 269: "I don't know," said Piers, "I wish you would come and see who it is."
LINE 270: "Very well, dear," Joyce said; "you are sure it is a _woman_?"
LINE 271: "Yes, and she is crying and sobbing."
LINE 272: Joyce followed Piers along the shrubbery path, now covered with a new
LINE 273: layer of fallen leaves, and, at the turn of a still narrower side path,
LINE 274: she saw, half hidden by the brambles and undergrowth, a woman; her head,
LINE 275: bowed upon her hands, and her attitude one of despair.
LINE 276: Joyce went near and said: "What is the matter? Are you in pain? Can I
LINE 277: help you?"
LINE 278: The woman raised her head, and Joyce recognised at once that she was
LINE 279: Susan Priday.
LINE 280: Thoughts of the night on Mendip; of the fierce onslaught made on Gilbert
LINE 281: Arundel by the big giant, and the almost certainty she felt, that the
LINE 282: cruel blow aimed at her father was by the same hand, made Joyce start
LINE 283: back and say, coldly:
LINE 284: "You had better not stay here, these are private grounds."
LINE 285: Piers, who was leaning against the bole of a beech tree, said:
LINE 286: "Yes; get up and go away. I will show you the gate into the road."
LINE 287: "Lady," said the girl, passionately, "I came to see _you_. I saw you
LINE 288: sobbing and crying on the bench yonder, for I got into the plantation
LINE 289: that way. I heard you sob, and call 'Father,' and then my heart nearly
LINE 290: broke, and I came round at the back and got over the hedge. I felt as if
LINE 291: I dare not speak to you. Do you know me, lady?"
LINE 292: "Yes," Joyce said; "of course I see who you are, but I--I cannot do
LINE 293: anything for you, and we are all in great grief, very, very great
LINE 294: grief," Joyce said, with a sudden spasm of agony in her voice.
LINE 295: "I know it, I know it, that's why I came; and I'm in grief, too. Father
LINE 296: is gone away, no one knows where; the boys have run off, and, oh! the
LINE 297: baby is dead. I did think I'd keep him, for mother's sake; but, in a
LINE 298: drunken fit, father threw a pot of boiling water at me. It missed me,
LINE 299: and the baby caught it on his neck and face, and it scalded him
LINE 300: dreadful. The school mistress was kind, and so was Mrs. Amos, she that
LINE 301: owns the farm; but he died--he died--and I am all alone. Oh! Miss, oh!
LINE 302: dear young lady, pity me."
LINE 303: "I do pity you," Joyce said. "But where is your father? For you must be
LINE 304: aware that suspicion points to him as the cause of my--of my dear
LINE 305: father's death."
LINE 306: "Yes, I do know it. Oh! miss, forgive me, and let me come and serve
LINE 307: you. I want no wage; but I'd die for you, if that would do you good. I
LINE 308: have never forgot your face that night, nor how you spoke soft then
LINE 309: instead of angry. Oh, miss, let me come and live with you. I will sleep
LINE 310: on the ground. I'll do the work of two in the dairy, or in the house,
LINE 311: and I want no wage. Poor mother always said God would take care of me,
LINE 312: but He has taken away the baby, He has, that is the cruellest part. And
LINE 313: father; oh! miss, you can't tell what it is to be filled with shame
LINE 314: about a father."
LINE 315: "No, indeed," Joyce said. "No; I know what it is to be proud of one, and
LINE 316: to----" Her voice broke down, and Piers said:
LINE 317: "She ought to go away, Joyce; she can't be left here."
LINE 318: But Joyce seemed to be thinking for a few minutes. Here was a girl whose
LINE 319: father had, as everyone thought, been the cause of her father's death;
LINE 320: here was the daughter of this man, coming to her and begging to be taken
LINE 321: into the house, to be her servant? Was it possible?
LINE 322: With a discretion far beyond her years, Joyce said, "I will make
LINE 323: inquiries about you from the school mistress, and if I find you really
LINE 324: bear a good character, I will get you a place, and----"
LINE 325: "I want no place apart from _you_" the girl said, passionately. "If I
LINE 326: could die to undo my father's wicked deed, I would die, and," she added,
LINE 327: sadly, "it ain't much I have to live for now the baby's gone. But if you
LINE 328: won't take me, well, I'll tramp to Bristol; and if I can't get bread in
LINE 329: an honest way, I must get it somehow else."
LINE 330: "No, no; don't say that. I must consider and think, and if I can take
LINE 331: you I will. Mrs. More is so ill, so ill that it is feared she will not
LINE 332: live, so I can't write to her. But I will _think_, and," she added, in a
LINE 333: low voice, "I will pray about it. I am in great trouble myself; we are
LINE 334: all in great trouble."
LINE 335: "I know it, I know it. Oh! dear lady, ever since night and day, night
LINE 336: and day, I have prayed for you, and that God would keep you."
LINE 337: There was something in the girl's despairing voice which touched Joyce
LINE 338: to the heart.
LINE 339: "Come round to the kitchen door with me," she said, "and I will see that
LINE 340: you have rest and food. I am sure you want both."
LINE 341: "I don't want rest; there is no rest in me, and food chokes me."
LINE 342: But Joyce took no notice of this, and saying, decidedly, "follow me,"
LINE 343: she put her hand on Piers' shoulder, and they went through the
LINE 344: plantation to the house, skirting it to the left instead of crossing
LINE 345: it, and so round to the stable-yard and the back premises.
LINE 346: Mrs. Falconer never had old maid servants; she trained girls to fill the
LINE 347: places in her household, and of these, there was an endless stream
LINE 348: passing through. The two in the kitchen now were both kindly,
LINE 349: good-tempered girls, utterly ignorant, but simple-hearted and honest.
LINE 350: "I want this poor young woman," Joyce said, "to rest by the fire; and
LINE 351: give her her supper before she leaves. Sarah, do you hear me?" Joyce
LINE 352: said.
LINE 353: "Yes, miss, I hear," Sarah said, surveying the poor, forlorn girl with
LINE 354: scorn. "Yes, miss. I don't know whether missis would hold with taking in
LINE 355: a tramp like her."
LINE 356: "I am going to ask mother now," Joyce said; "and I know you are
LINE 357: kind-hearted, Sarah, and that you will attend to this poor girl, because
LINE 358: I wish it."
LINE 359: Sarah gave a low sound, which was taken for consent; and Joyce, judging
LINE 360: rightly that Susan Priday would be better left to the servants, went to
LINE 361: find her mother.
LINE 362: As she crossed the hall she met Ralph.
LINE 363: "There are letters from Italy," he said. "Melville had not heard when he
LINE 364: wrote."
LINE 365: "Where are the letters?" Joyce asked.
LINE 366: "Mother has them. There is one for you--not from Italy though; it has
LINE 367: the Bristol post-mark, and is franked. There was an immense deal to pay
LINE 368: for Melville's."
LINE 369: Joyce waited to hear no more, but went to her mother. She was sitting
LINE 370: with her son's letter open before her. It began, "Dear father and
LINE 371: mother," and these words went like a knife through Joyce's heart.
LINE 372: Mrs. Falconer sat day after day in the same chair by the fire-place. Her
LINE 373: large widow's cap--in those days an immense erection of many thick
LINE 374: frillings, and with long "weepers" falling over her shoulders--altered
LINE 375: her so entirely, scarcely any one would have recognised her.
LINE 376: Joyce glanced through the letter. It was as self-sufficient and trifling
LINE 377: as ever. Melville found foreign travel less delightful than he had
LINE 378: expected.
LINE 379: The diligence was then the universal mode of transit through France, and
LINE 380: the two travellers had taken a whole month to reach Hyères, a journey
LINE 381: which can now be got through in three days at the longest calculation.
LINE 382: Melville complained of the food and the cramped diligence, and how the
LINE 383: smell of garlic made him sick; and how old Crawford was as "stiff as
LINE 384: starch," and that he did not think he should stay away long.
LINE 385: Of Genoa la Superba not a word, except to say that he had seen a fine
LINE 386: copy of one of Raphael's pictures for sale, which, if his father would
LINE 387: send the money, he would buy, for the dining hall at Fair Acres.
LINE 388: Joyce had hardly patience to finish the letter; but her mother said:
LINE 389: "Give the letter to me, Joyce." And then she smoothed the thin sheet of
LINE 390: foreign paper tenderly, and, refolding it, placed it in her large
LINE 391: work-box, which stood unused by her side.
LINE 392: Joyce, meantime, opened the other letter, and a bright flush came over
LINE 393: her face. She could not read it there; she put it into her deep pocket,
LINE 394: and said:
LINE 395: "Dear mother, a poor girl is in the kitchen; she is utterly friendless
LINE 396: and forlorn. May I let her sleep in the empty attic to-night, till I
LINE 397: make inquiries about her of the mistress of one of Mrs. More's schools
LINE 398: to-morrow?"
LINE 399: "You can do as you like, Joyce," was the reply, as poor Mrs. Falconer
LINE 400: relapsed into her usual condition of dreary silence, after kindling into
LINE 401: some interest about Melville's letter.
LINE 402: "You can do as you like--my day is over."
LINE 403: "Mother, dearest mother, do not say so; you will feel better soon. It
LINE 404: is--it is the suddenness of the blow that has come upon you--and upon us
LINE 405: all--that has stunned you. Do try to take comfort."
LINE 406: "Comfort, Joyce! You don't know what you are saying. I lived for your
LINE 407: father--and I have lost him. It was cruel, cruel to take him in his
LINE 408: prime, to leave me desolate!"
LINE 409: "You have got us children to love you, mother," Joyce ventured to say;
LINE 410: "and think how good Ralph is, giving up everything he cared for most, to
LINE 411: take up the business of the farm."
LINE 412: "As if he could do that," was the reply. "Ralph is not fit for it."
LINE 413: "Mr. Watson says it is wonderful how he has fallen into the ways of
LINE 414: people on the estate. He has such a firm will and purpose in everything
LINE 415: he does."
LINE 416: Mrs. Falconer sighed.
LINE 417: "Well," she said, "I don't want to talk any more about it. I think if
LINE 418: you will get me the yarn I will go on knitting Harry's stockings."
LINE 419: "Oh, yes," Joyce said; "and Piers will be so pleased to hold the skeins
LINE 420: for you, mother."
LINE 421: Then she kissed her mother again and again, and whispered:
LINE 422: "You will come to church on Sunday, mother, won't you? It is so dull for
LINE 423: you, sitting here day after day."
LINE 424: "I can do nothing else," was the reply--"nothing else. What else should
LINE 425: I do? You are a dear, good child, Joyce. He always said so; he was
LINE 426: always right."
LINE 427: There is nothing harder to meet than a grief like poor Mrs. Falconer's;
LINE 428: or rather, I should say, there is nothing harder to meet than a grief
LINE 429: which refuses to recognise love in the midst of anguish which hardens
LINE 430: and, as it were, paralyzes the whole being; changes the fountain of
LINE 431: sweetness into bitterness; making the accustomed routine of duty
LINE 432: impossible and falling on the sufferer like a heavy pall.
LINE 433: "Missus is like somebody else; can't believe it is missus at all," the
LINE 434: maids said, when Joyce returned with the orders for poor Susan to remain
LINE 435: all night, and to be cared for till the morning.
LINE 436: The poor girl was so utterly exhausted that she had fallen asleep, her
LINE 437: face hidden on her arm, her elbows on the kitchen table; and her
LINE 438: attitude of utter helplessness touched Joyce.
LINE 439: "Be kind to her," she said; "she is very unhappy. Be kind to her, Sarah.
LINE 440: I know you _will_ be kind to her as I wish it."
LINE 441: Then Joyce ran to her room and took the letter from her pocket.
LINE 442: The evening was closing in fast, but kneeling on the window-seat, she
LINE 443: opened the lattice, and all the daylight yet lingering in the west fell
LINE 444: upon the clearly written page of Bath post paper.
LINE 445: The letter was dated: "Sion Hill, Clifton, near Bristol," and began:
LINE 446: "If I have delayed sending you an expression of my sympathy in your
LINE 447: trouble, dear Miss Falconer, it has been that I feared to intrude
LINE 448: upon you in your grief, and feared, too, that I should touch it
LINE 449: with too rough a hand. But I remember your parting words, your kind
LINE 450: promise not to forget me. Thus I venture to tell you that I bear
LINE 451: you ever in my mind, and that the time may come, _will_ come, when
LINE 452: I shall beg you to hear more from me than I can say now, and grant
LINE 453: me a very earnest petition. But not now would I speak of myself or
LINE 454: of my hopes and fears. Rather would I tell you how I pray God to
LINE 455: comfort you for the loss of a father, whom I count it an honour to
LINE 456: have known. I would ask you to believe that I, who have had the
LINE 457: privilege of watching the happy home-life--now, alas! so sadly
LINE 458: broken up--can, at least, understand what the wreck must be. Please
LINE 459: present my regards and sympathy to Mrs. Falconer, and assure her
LINE 460: of my remembrance of her kindness to me while her guest at Fair
LINE 461: Acres, if indeed you think I may venture so far.
LINE 462: "I remain, dear Miss Falconer,
LINE 463: "Your very faithful and true
LINE 464: "GILBERT DECOURCY ARUNDEL."
LINE 465: There was a postscript written on the blank part of the sheet of Bath
LINE 466: post, which was folded over.
LINE 467: "My mother is likely to visit the Palace, at Wells, in November. I
LINE 468: have charged her, if possible, to see you at Fair Acres. I have
LINE 469: heard nothing from your brother, but I am well satisfied that he is
LINE 470: out of England, for reasons which you know.--G. DeC. A."
LINE 471: The reserved style of this letter, so different from the random shots of
LINE 472: the present day, when young men and maidens seem to think the form of a
LINE 473: telegram the most appropriate way of expressing their thoughts, may
LINE 474: provoke a smile, and be pronounced priggish and formal. But in Joyce's
LINE 475: eyes it was a perfect letter, and she felt it to be a support and
LINE 476: comfort to her in her loneliness. Words which come from the heart seldom
LINE 477: miss their aim; and Joyce felt that, underlying those carefully written
LINE 478: lines, there was the certainty that if her promise to him was
LINE 479: fulfilled, and that she thought, even in her sorrow, of him continually,
LINE 480: _he_, on his part, did not forget her.
LINE 481: In the simplicity of her young heart, she had never dreamed that Gilbert
LINE 482: could really care for her, and his long silence had made her think of
LINE 483: him only as of someone who had passed out of her life, and was to be in
LINE 484: future but a memory. Now the fluttering hope became almost a certainty,
LINE 485: and she repeated to herself many times that evening, as a bird repeats
LINE 486: its song over and over with the same rapture of content--
LINE 487: "I bear you ever in my mind, and the time may come, _will_ come, when I
LINE 488: will beg you to hear more from me than I dare to say now, and grant me a
LINE 489: very earnest petition."
LINE 490: "The time _will_ come--the time _will_ come, and, meanwhile, I can
LINE 491: wait," she thought. "Yes, the time will come, and I can wait."
