LINE 1: TUMULT.
LINE 2: When Gilbert Arundel had placed his little children in safety with their
LINE 3: grandmother, he hastened back to Bristol, and found the uproar
LINE 4: increasing.
LINE 5: Queen Square was filled with the rioters, who were now letting loose the
LINE 6: most furious rage against the Mayor and Recorder. They tore up the iron
LINE 7: railings in front of the Mansion House, and hooted and scoffed at the
LINE 8: Riot Act, which was read by the Mayor's order, and the force of special
LINE 9: constables was quite insufficient.
LINE 10: Gilbert saw this at once, and now, when the cry arose: "Fire the Mansion
LINE 11: House!" it was a relief to see some action taken, by a troop of the 14th
LINE 12: Light Dragoons, and Dragoon Guards trotting into the Square.
LINE 13: There was to all noble-hearted men, something terribly humiliating in
LINE 14: the aspect of affairs. Here was a seething, ignorant crowd of men,
LINE 15: women, and boys, intimidating the magistrates, frightening the Mayor
LINE 16: till he actually barricaded his windows in the Mansion House with his
LINE 17: bed; and Sir Charles Wetherall beating an undignified retreat from the
LINE 18: flat roof of the dining-room. There, helped by a woman's hand, who set
LINE 19: up a ladder for him, he dropped in pitiable terror into the stables
LINE 20: behind, and hid in a loft. Gilbert, standing on guard by the corner of
LINE 21: the Square with four friends bravely holding their ground, and warding
LINE 22: off with their staves the excited crowd, recognised in the dim light the
LINE 23: Recorder slipping by, in a post-boy's dress, which actually passed him
LINE 24: through the crowd, till he found himself safe at Kingsdown. And if the
LINE 25: cowardice of the Recorder, in escaping for dear life from the storm he
LINE 26: had himself roused was unprecedented, the wavering uncertainty of the
LINE 27: Colonel in command of the troops was scarcely less reprehensible!
LINE 28: How Gilbert longed to take a prominent part, and how his heart burned
LINE 29: with righteous indignation against the weakness and incapacity of those
LINE 30: in command.
LINE 31: Everything seemed to go from bad to worse, till Captain Gage received
LINE 32: orders to protect the Council-house. He then charged through High Street
LINE 33: and Wine Street, and drove the rioters, who assailed the soldiers with
LINE 34: stones, into the narrow lanes and alleys.
LINE 35: [Illustration: Wine Street, Bristol.]
LINE 36: Many were wounded with sabre cuts, and Gilbert, in his efforts to save a
LINE 37: woman and child from being trampled down, just by the old timber house
LINE 38: at the corner of Wine Street, was overpowered by the press behind him,
LINE 39: and, just as he had succeeded in placing the woman and her infant in
LINE 40: safety on the high stone sill of a window, he was stunned by a blow,
LINE 41: given at a venture from a stout stick, and would have fallen and been
LINE 42: trampled to death, had not a pair of strong arms seized him and borne
LINE 43: him to a comparatively quiet place on the quay.
LINE 44: Gilbert was stunned and hardly conscious, and when he found himself on
LINE 45: his feet, he staggered and fell against a wall. Some soldiers riding up,
LINE 46: chased a band of rioters out of Clare Street, and Gilbert saw the great
LINE 47: giant who had delivered him felled by a sabre cut. The crowd passed over
LINE 48: him, and when it had cleared, Gilbert, himself feeble and exhausted,
LINE 49: bent over the man, and tried to drag him nearer the houses.
LINE 50: He was bleeding profusely, and hailing a cart passing to the Infirmary
LINE 51: with two wounded men, Gilbert begged the driver in charge, to raise the
LINE 52: prostrate man, and take him also to the Infirmary. It was no easy
LINE 53: matter, but at last it was accomplished, and a pair of dark, blood-shot
LINE 54: eyes were turned on Gilbert. The man tried to articulate, but no sound
LINE 55: came. As the cart was moving off, Gilbert saw he made a desperate
LINE 56: effort.
LINE 57: He raised his hand, and cried out with all his remaining strength, "Tell
LINE 58: your good lady I kept my word, and I saved you from harm!"
LINE 59: "Stop!" Gilbert said to the driver, "stop; this man has saved my life. I
LINE 60: must come to the Infirmary to see he has proper care and attention."
LINE 61: "You look fit for a 'ospital bed yourself, sir," said the man. "Jump up,
LINE 62: and I'll take you for a consideration," he added, with a knowing twinkle
LINE 63: of his eye.
LINE 64: Faint and exhausted himself, Gilbert saw the wounded man placed in one
LINE 65: of the wards with the others, whose condition was less serious, and,
LINE 66: bending over the man, he said:
LINE 67: "I recognise you now. You are Bob Priday?"
LINE 68: The man nodded assent.
LINE 69: "I've been a bad 'un," he said. "I went in for these riots, 'cause I was
LINE 70: sick of my life; but I'd like to see your good lady once more, and poor
LINE 71: little Sue. Her mother used to reckon her next to a saint, as she sat
LINE 72: learning her hymns. I've scoffed and jeered at 'em, and sent the boys to
LINE 73: the bad, and threatened the squire. I did not kill him, though; and yet,
LINE 74: what do you think, she, the squire's daughter, your good lady, bid _God
LINE 75: bless me_, and let me touch her hand; why, ever since I've kinder felt
LINE 76: that if _she_ could pardon, God might."
LINE 77: "He _will_ pardon the chief of sinners, for Christ's sake," said
LINE 78: Gilbert.
LINE 79: The man's wound was bleeding profusely, and he soon became confused and
LINE 80: wandering; and his face assumed a livid hue as Gilbert bent over him.
LINE 81: "My wife will not forget that you saved my life," he said; "and I know
LINE 82: if it is possible she will come and see you, and bring your daughter
LINE 83: with her."
LINE 84: "He is nearly unconscious," said the surgeon. "Dear me! sir, what a time
LINE 85: this is for Bristol. This is the sixth case brought in since noon. God
LINE 86: knows where the riots will end! You were sworn in as a special
LINE 87: constable, I suppose?"
LINE 88: "Yes, but to little purpose. Resistance is useless, unless well
LINE 89: organised."
LINE 90: "That's true enough; but there is no head, that's the mischief of it; no
LINE 91: head anywhere. Do you live in Bristol, sir?"
LINE 92: "In Great George Street; I am returning there now. You will look after
LINE 93: this man?"
LINE 94: "Yes; but he won't get over it. A bad subject--a very bad subject. He is
LINE 95: very prostrate," the surgeon continued, laying a professional finger on
LINE 96: the great muscular wrist; "his hours are numbered. That's a bad blow on
LINE 97: your forehead, sir; let me put a bandage on; and how are you getting
LINE 98: home?"
LINE 99: "As I came, I suppose. There seems a lull in the uproar now, and I shall
LINE 100: be able to get back by Trinity Street and up by Brandon Hill."
LINE 101: Gilbert submitted to the bandage, and thankfully drank a reviving
LINE 102: draught, which the surgeon gave him, and then he turned his face
LINE 103: homewards.
LINE 104: He was dizzy and bewildered, and did not feel as if he could again face
LINE 105: the crowd, so he reached home by a circuitous road, entering Great
LINE 106: George Street from the upper end.
LINE 107: It was nearly one o'clock before he stood by his own door, and he found
LINE 108: two of his friends, who had served with him as special constables,
LINE 109: coming out. They had left Queen's Square empty, they said, and not a
LINE 110: rioter was to be seen there, and the troops had returned to their
LINE 111: quarters.
LINE 112: Joyce, hearing her husband's voice, came downstairs, and not a moment
LINE 113: too soon. Thoroughly exhausted, and suffering from the blow on his head,
LINE 114: he would have fallen, had not his two friends caught him and carried
LINE 115: him, at Joyce's request, to his own room.
LINE 116: Gilbert tried to make light of his condition, and said it was only the
LINE 117: noise and shouting which had bewildered him.
LINE 118: "We lost sight of you after the troops cleared Queen's Square, Arundel.
LINE 119: What became of you?"
LINE 120: "I got separated in the rush just by Wine Street, and there a woman and
LINE 121: a baby were in some danger; and as I made a plunge to get them to a
LINE 122: place of safety, someone gave me a chance thump on the head, and I
LINE 123: might have been trampled to death had not a man saved me, in his turn to
LINE 124: be cut down by the sabre of one of the soldiers; he now lies dying in
LINE 125: the Infirmary; and the man, Joyce, is Bob Priday."
LINE 126: "He kept his promise, then." Joyce said, clasping her hands; "he kept
LINE 127: his promise to me."
LINE 128: "Yes, darling, it was the touch of your little, white hand, he said,
LINE 129: which brought to his heart the hope that God would forgive him."
LINE 130: Joyce, kneeling by the sofa where her husband lay, hid her face in the
LINE 131: pillow, while Mr. Bengough and Mr. Cooper, his two friends, left the
LINE 132: room with Mrs. Arundel, and promised to send a surgeon who lived near
LINE 133: them in Berkley Square.
LINE 134: "He is as brave as a lion," Mr. Bengough said; "you may well be proud of
LINE 135: your son."
LINE 136: The doctor came, and advised entire rest and quiet, and told Joyce that
LINE 137: she might console herself with the certainty that her husband would be
LINE 138: unfit for any action, as special constable for many a day to come.
LINE 139: How thankful Joyce felt that she had not left the house with her
LINE 140: children, and that she was there to nurse and tend her husband with the
LINE 141: thousand sweet observances which are the consolation of every true wife
LINE 142: to render, in the hour of need.
LINE 143: The Sunday morning broke over an apparently quiet city, and as Joyce
LINE 144: looked from the window of her room, after two hours of refreshing sleep,
LINE 145: she could see no one moving in the distant streets, and heard no sound.
LINE 146: It seemed a true sabbath stillness, which was in itself a healing power.
LINE 147: As the mist of the October morning lifted, the Cathedral Tower, and that
LINE 148: of St. Mary Redclyffe, stood out in solemn majesty, steadfast and
LINE 149: unmoved for all the riot and confusion which had so lately reigned
LINE 150: beneath them.
LINE 151: St. Stephen's stately tower, further to the left, raised its head above
LINE 152: the street where Joyce knew her husband had been in such peril; and her
LINE 153: heart swelled with thankfulness to God, who had preserved his life. Then
LINE 154: her thoughts flew to the Infirmary ward, where Bob Priday lay dying, and
LINE 155: she felt determined that, if possible, Susan should see him, and she
LINE 156: laid her plans to effect this meeting.
LINE 157: As soon as Falcon woke, she lifted him from his bed and took him to the
LINE 158: nursery, washing him and dressing him, and kneeling with him to say his
LINE 159: morning prayers; then she said to the boy:
LINE 160: "Falcon, grandmamma is asleep, and so is dear father. Dear father has
LINE 161: been hurt by the rioters, and is to lie in bed very quiet all day. I
LINE 162: want to go up to Clifton to see the baby Joy, and Lettice and Lota. I
LINE 163: shall leave you to watch by father, and if he stirs or wakes, call
LINE 164: grandmamma. Will you do this?"
LINE 165: "Yes, mother," the boy said. Then with a sigh, "I hope the riots are
LINE 166: over now. At first I liked to hear the noise, and watch the crowd, but I
LINE 167: got tired of it. Are we to go to church, mother?"
LINE 168: "If I can get back in time, darling, you shall go to church with Mary,
LINE 169: but I don't think I shall go to-day."
LINE 170: Then she gave Falcon his basin of bread and milk, moving so gently that
LINE 171: no one heard her lighting the nursery fire, and performing with her
LINE 172: accustomed nicety all the little household duties which had been
LINE 173: familiar to her from early childhood. Then she shared Falcon's breakfast
LINE 174: with him, gave him a volume of the old "Children's Friend," with the
LINE 175: funny little woodcuts, which were the delight of the children of fifty
LINE 176: years ago; and, establishing him in the window-seat in his father's
LINE 177: room, left him on guard. It was beautiful to see how the noisy,
LINE 178: high-spirited child, responded to his mother's hand, and felt a proud
LINE 179: sense of serving her, as he was left in the room to take care of his
LINE 180: father.
LINE 181: The clocks were chiming a quarter to eight as Joyce reached Park Street,
LINE 182: where all was quiet, but she heard several passers by, say that Queen's
LINE 183: Square was again thronged, and that the "roughs" were forcing their way
LINE 184: back to the scene of the previous day's disturbances.
LINE 185: By the turn to Berkley Square, Joyce met Mr. Bengough, who was hurrying
LINE 186: down to the Guildhall, where, he said, Major Mackworth was attempting to
LINE 187: organise the special constables; but that Colonel Brereton's folly in
LINE 188: removing his troops to the Leigh stables, had given the mob every
LINE 189: encouragement.
LINE 190: "You may be glad, Mrs. Arundel, that your husband is out of the fray;
LINE 191: there will be more broken heads before midnight, I expect."
LINE 192: "I trust and pray, you may be kept safely. Come in, later in the day,
LINE 193: and let us hear," Joyce said, as she parted from Mr. Bengough and walked
LINE 194: quickly towards Clifton. All was quiet there, and when Joyce arrived at
LINE 195: Down Cottage, her two little girls came flying to meet her, looking like
LINE 196: two daisies, fresh from their morning bath.
LINE 197: Joyce was struck with her mother's admirable management. She was always
LINE 198: up with the lark in her old home at Fair Acres, and she kept up her
LINE 199: country habits.
LINE 200: The breakfast was ready in the little dining-room, and everyone was
LINE 201: there but Charlotte. Piers had the baby Joy, upon his knee, and Mrs.
LINE 202: Falcon declared she had been as "good as gold" all night.
LINE 203: It was hard to believe that Clifton Down Cottage could be so near to the
LINE 204: tumultuous city; everything seemed going on as it did every day, and no
LINE 205: one appeared excited or troubled. When Joyce had told her story of the
LINE 206: previous night, however, the real state of affairs seemed brought home
LINE 207: to the little party, and Lota said:
LINE 208: "I want to go home to kiss father, and make his head well."
LINE 209: Presently Joyce said she must see Susan, and she asked Piers to come
LINE 210: with her for a moment into his own room.
LINE 211: Piers delivered the baby to her grandmother, and, taking up his
LINE 212: crutches, followed Joyce. In the passage they met Charlotte.
LINE 213: "How early you have come," she said. "I was called so early, as Mrs.
LINE 214: Falconer wanted the rooms to be made tidy; but really I was not fit to
LINE 215: get up at all. I am so dreadfully upset by yesterday's events."
LINE 216: "Joyce has more reason to be upset, as you call it," Piers said, "than
LINE 217: you have, with Gilbert laid up with a blow on his head."
LINE 218: "Oh! how _dreadful_! how shocking! dearest Joyce; what _can_ I do?"
LINE 219: "Nothing; but go and have your breakfast; mother hates having the things
LINE 220: kept on the table."
LINE 221: "I have no patience with her," Piers said, wrathfully, as he closed the
LINE 222: door of his den behind him and his sister; "I do verily believe she
LINE 223: thinks she is going to be Lady Maythorne, I do indeed."
LINE 224: "Oh! Piers, impossible! she cannot be so foolish."
LINE 225: "My dear, it would be a long plumb-line to sound her folly, or his
LINE 226: either."
LINE 227: "But he is in difficulties as to money; he came here because he wanted
LINE 228: to get some out of his sister."
LINE 229: "Has Aunt Letitia any money?" Piers asked.
LINE 230: "Of course, she has her own income, and----"
LINE 231: "Will leave it all to Charlotte. Now do you see?"
LINE 232: "I see what you mean, but it must be prevented, it is too preposterous."
LINE 233: "But now, Piers, dear Piers, I want to ask your advice. I could not
LINE 234: trouble Gilbert, he is very much hurt," and Joyce's voice faltered. "The
LINE 235: man who saved Gilbert's life is Susan's father, Bob Priday."
LINE 236: Piers made a gesture of astonishment. "The man who took our father's
LINE 237: life," he murmured.
LINE 238: "Indirectly, not intentionally quite, as we always thought. Piers, I
LINE 239: should like to go to the Infirmary, and take Susan with me. Will you
LINE 240: help us, and come with us?"
LINE 241: "You may get into another scrimmage, Joyce; is it right?"
LINE 242: "I think it is right," Joyce said, gently; "I asked God about it, you
LINE 243: know."
LINE 244: Here was Joyce's sense of strength in weakness; she had always a refuge
LINE 245: and a Councillor at hand. Her religion was not one of many words; it was
LINE 246: emphatically the religion of Peace--and in quietness and confidence she
LINE 247: could rest.
LINE 248: "It seems to me, Piers, as if it would be cruel to deny a dying man this
LINE 249: last act of grace."
LINE 250: "He does not deserve it."
LINE 251: "Ah! Piers, what do we deserve of God?"
LINE 252: "Well," he said, "I will go with you if I can get a hackney-coach; a
LINE 253: lame fellow like me can't very well trudge down there on foot. But as
LINE 254: you do everything to please other people, it is only fair I should try
LINE 255: to please you."
LINE 256: "I don't wish to tell mother yet, but I will go and call Susan, dear,
LINE 257: good Susan, and tell her to get ready."
LINE 258: "I hope she won't make a scene," Piers said, "I hate scenes, and I don't
LINE 259: see what good you will do, but here goes;" and Piers took his hat and
LINE 260: went to do his sister's bidding.
