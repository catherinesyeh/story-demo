LINE 1: ON SION HILL, CLIFTON.
LINE 2: Gilbert Arundel was to meet his mother in Clifton, where arrangements
LINE 3: were to be made for their permanent residence there. Clifton was at this
LINE 4: time gradually changing its position, or rather enlarging its borders!
LINE 5: At the close of the preceding century, or during the latter half of it,
LINE 6: Clifton Spa was the chief attraction. To these healing waters, as we
LINE 7: know by Mason's celebrated epitaph, a sorrowing husband brought his
LINE 8: fading wife. Dowry Square and Dowry Parade, with their little quaint
LINE 9: pillars and balconies were in great request for invalids and visitors,
LINE 10: from their near neighbourhood to the pump room.
LINE 11: Consumptive patients might be seen slowly walking under the row of trees
LINE 12: by the banks of the muddy Avon, and gazing across at the deep recesses
LINE 13: of the Leigh Woods with wistful eyes. To the weak and the ailing
LINE 14: Nightingale Valley was then, though so near, very far off for them, and
LINE 15: only the robust and vigorous could cross the river by Rownham Ferry,
LINE 16: and scale the wooded heights which at all times and in all seasons are
LINE 17: so fair to look upon.
LINE 18: But at the time of which I write the tide of visitors was setting in
LINE 19: _upwards_. The word "relaxing" was coming into fashion, and enterprising
LINE 20: builders had raised, halfway up the hill, Windsor Terrace and the
LINE 21: Paragon, that circular range of houses which, entered from the level
LINE 22: road before Prince's Buildings, ends abruptly in a house which may
LINE 23: indeed be said to "be built upon a rock," the windows looking straight
LINE 24: down its precipitous sides.
LINE 25: Along the road which I have mentioned, which follows the course of the
LINE 26: river, though high above it, was erected 'Prince's Buildings;' the
LINE 27: 'first gentleman in Europe' during his long regency appears to have
LINE 28: supplied the names of many streets and terraces in this neighbourhood.
LINE 29: Coronation Road beneath commemorates the auspicious event when Queen
LINE 30: Caroline was shut out from her rights, and Prince's Buildings above was
LINE 31: also previously named in his honour. Crescents and terraces were quick
LINE 32: to follow one another on the heights, and the glories of the Hot wells,
LINE 33: and the salubrity of the waters, became things of the past.
LINE 34: Bracing air began to be the panacea for ailments, and the Clifton Downs,
LINE 35: now secured to the citizens of Bristol by the merchant venturers for
LINE 36: ever, were sought by many who, a few years before, would have buried
LINE 37: themselves and their hopes of recovery under the shadow of the rocky
LINE 38: heights, instead of facing the keen air upon their summit.
LINE 39: There was a medium preserved, however--Prince's Buildings, and the
LINE 40: houses built on the slope of Sion Hill, were sheltered at the back and
LINE 41: from the front commanded a view of the Leigh Woods before them, and a
LINE 42: shoulder of the great St. Vincent Rock to their right, which might well
LINE 43: excite the admiration of those who saw it for the first time.
LINE 44: After Gilbert Arundel had stepped less briskly than sometimes up the
LINE 45: steep slope of Granby Hill, leaving the Crescent to his right, he passed
LINE 46: along the back of Prince's Buildings and up Sion Hill, where his mother
LINE 47: had taken up her temporary abode.
LINE 48: These houses are built with old-fashioned bow windows, some of them
LINE 49: running up from the basement to the roof, and one or two with circular
LINE 50: balconies on the second story.
LINE 51: As Gilbert was beginning to consider which number his mother had given
LINE 52: as her address, he heard his name called from above, and looking up, a
LINE 53: tall, fashionably dressed young lady said:
LINE 54: "Gilbert, we thought you were never coming from Fair Acres. There
LINE 55: must have been some great attraction."
LINE 56: [Illustration: St Vincent's Rock, From Leigh Woods.]
LINE 57: Gilbert did not care to have his personal history proclaimed to the
LINE 58: people who were seated on benches at the top of the Zig-zag--a path now
LINE 59: cut in the rock and made easier of ascent by means of flights of steps,
LINE 60: but then scarcely more than a bridle path, rough and slippery to the
LINE 61: feet.
LINE 62: The door was open and Gilbert walked in, and walked upstairs. His mother
LINE 63: was on the watch, and came to the head of the stairs to meet him,
LINE 64: kissing him affectionately.
LINE 65: "Well, my dear son, are you pleased with our quarters? But, Gilbert, you
LINE 66: do not look well; what is the matter?"
LINE 67: "Nothing; I had a tussle with a Somersetshire miner last evening, and
LINE 68: feel as if I had got the worst of it to-day. What a lovely view you have
LINE 69: from the window!"
LINE 70: The young lady who had spoken to him on the balcony now stepped into the
LINE 71: room.
LINE 72: "Well, Gilbert, Aunt Annabella and I had quite given you up. My dear
LINE 73: cousin, you look very lugubrious."
LINE 74: "Do I?" Gilbert replied. "A head-ache is a lugubrious thing; and how are
LINE 75: you, Gratian?"
LINE 76: "Pretty well. I have been rather out of sorts; but I shall soon recover,
LINE 77: now you are come."
LINE 78: "That is a very pretty speech, Gratian, only I can't quite believe it."
LINE 79: "Well, I am going to take a walk abroad now, and leave you and your
LINE 80: mother to have a chat together, all about Fairy Acre, or Fair Acre;
LINE 81: which is it? I am very stupid; pray forgive me. Any commissions in the
LINE 82: Mall or Regent Street, Aunt Bella?"
LINE 83: Mrs. Arundel, who had been getting her son some refreshment from one of
LINE 84: the deep cupboards by the fire place, and was anxious to administer a
LINE 85: glass of wine, now turned towards her niece. "No. Are you going alone,
LINE 86: Gratian?"
LINE 87: "Yes, I am starting alone; I don't mean to fall over the rocks.
LINE 88: Good-bye."
LINE 89: Gratian Anson was long past her _premi√®re jeunesse_, and had never been
LINE 90: actually pretty; but she was one of those women who exercise an
LINE 91: extraordinary fascination apparently without any effort, and have their
LINE 92: prey in their net, before there is any suspicion that the net is spread.
LINE 93: Gratian dressed fashionably, and one of her perfections was a tall and
LINE 94: well-proportioned figure. We might not, now-a-days, think it was set off
LINE 95: by her short and full-flounced muslin gown, made with a short waist,
LINE 96: the body cut low, while over it she wore an enormous pelerine of muslin,
LINE 97: edged with lace, which was crossed ever her breast and fastened with a
LINE 98: curious antique brooch.
LINE 99: Even Gratian's tall figure could scarcely bear gracefully the width
LINE 100: which fashion had decreed; and all was surmounted by a hat with a
LINE 101: sugar-loaf crown, and a deep brim caught up on the left side by a large
LINE 102: red rosette.
LINE 103: As she drew on her long, loose gloves, she surveyed her cousin with an
LINE 104: appraising, searching glance. Her eyes were at all times too keen, and
LINE 105: her wide mouth displayed a row of white teeth more fully than was quite
LINE 106: agreeable.
LINE 107: "Ah!" she said, tapping Gilbert's shoulder; "ah! he is in love. I have
LINE 108: no doubt of it! _Adieu; au revoir, cher cousin!_"
LINE 109: "The same as ever!" Gilbert said. "Thank you, dear mother," he said,
LINE 110: rising with his accustomed courtesy to take the glass of wine from her
LINE 111: hand. "Thanks. I confess I am rather knocked up; and if I had known Sion
LINE 112: Hill was so far from the Bristol coach office I should have come up in a
LINE 113: hackney, I think, instead of sending my luggage by the carrier. But how
LINE 114: beautiful this is!" he said, stepping on the balcony and looking out
LINE 115: upon the scene before him.
LINE 116: No piers had yet been raised for the great design of the Suspension
LINE 117: Bridge--that vast dream of Brunel's, which for so many years seemed
LINE 118: fated to remain only a dream; while the naked buttresses, in all their
LINE 119: huge proportions, stood like giants on either side of the gorge,
LINE 120: connected only by a rod of iron, over which a few people with strong
LINE 121: nerves were allowed to pass in a sliding basket.
LINE 122: Gilbert looked out on a scene which can hardly be equalled for the
LINE 123: unusual beauty of its salient points.
LINE 124: "We shall be happy to live here, mother," Gilbert said.
LINE 125: "You have no misgivings, my dear son."
LINE 126: "No, it is clear I must make my living in some practical way, and why
LINE 127: not by the law?"
LINE 128: "There is the drudgery of the office first, and then the passing of
LINE 129: examinations."
LINE 130: "I have weighed all the pros and cons with you before; why do you go
LINE 131: over them again?" This was said in an irritable tone.
LINE 132: "I would as soon be a man of law as anything; and I want to make a
LINE 133: home"--he paused--"for _you_, and for one whom I have found under the
LINE 134: Mendips."
LINE 135: His mother had seated herself by his side, on a bench which stood in the
LINE 136: verandah or balcony.
LINE 137: "It can't be thought of yet," he said; "she is Falconer's sister! He
LINE 138: never told me he had a sister, or, rather, I should say, _such_ a
LINE 139: sister. How should he be able to see what she is? I don't want to talk
LINE 140: sentiment, mother, but I will say I did not know how beautiful and
LINE 141: simple hearted she was, and how her beauty was supreme with no fine
LINE 142: dress, till I saw Gratian just now."
LINE 143: His mother laid her hand on his. "What is her name, Gilbert?"
LINE 144: "Joyce: it suits her as no other name could. Joyce!" he repeated. "Joy,
LINE 145: Sunshine, Birdie; they call her all these names at Fair Acres. Some day,
LINE 146: when we are settled at Bristol, will you ask her to visit you, mother?
LINE 147: and when you see her you will love her."
LINE 148: "I shall love her for your sake," his mother said, gently.
LINE 149: They had been all in all to each other for twenty-three years; and
LINE 150: though Mrs. Arundel had told herself a hundred times that she desired
LINE 151: nothing so much for Gilbert as the love of a true hearted woman, still
LINE 152: she was conscious of a little thrill of pain; for she must, in the
LINE 153: natural course of things, be _second_ now.
LINE 154: "I could not describe her if I tried," he went on, with lover-like
LINE 155: enthusiasm. "Then there is such strength in her as well as sweetness.
LINE 156: Last night we were attacked by a ruffian whom her father, who is a
LINE 157: magistrate, had offended, and her presence of mind and calmness were
LINE 158: wonderful. The man knocked me down, and I returned the compliment, which
LINE 159: is the cause of my stupidity to-day."
LINE 160: His mother scanned his face anxiously. "Have you told her of your love?"
LINE 161: "Not formally; but I feel she must know it."
LINE 162: "One word more, Gilbert, has she the _real_ spring of all beauty and
LINE 163: goodness within. Has she chosen the right path, following her Master?"
LINE 164: Gilbert was silent for a minute.
LINE 165: "It is not a religious household," he said. "They have no prayers,
LINE 166: except on Sundays. It is a miserable church, with an old drone of a
LINE 167: parson, who gallops through the service; but, I think, Joyce is ready to
LINE 168: follow, if led in the right way."
LINE 169: "And you are strong enough to lead, Gilbert?"
LINE 170: "I hope so," he said earnestly; and then mother and son were silent for
LINE 171: a few minutes. Afterwards they began to speak of Melville, and all the
LINE 172: past, in which Gilbert had borne such a noble part.
LINE 173: "I have separated him from Maythorne, and at least that is a step in the
LINE 174: right direction; but he is so weak. How he came to be her brother, I
LINE 175: can't imagine; he is crazed on the subject of titles, and will roll off
LINE 176: a list of intimate friends, when he thinks I am not listening, to whom
LINE 177: he never spoke ten words in his life. I dined at the palace, and the
LINE 178: bishop sent you his love, and so did his son, who lives with him--two
LINE 179: courteous gentlemen, with well-turned compliments at their tongue's end.
LINE 180: The bishop said I was like you, and that I had followed in the lines of
LINE 181: one of the most beautiful women he ever met."
LINE 182: "What bare-faced flattery!" Mrs. Arundel said, laughing. "I never was a
LINE 183: beauty. Your good looks come from the other side of the house."
LINE 184: "Who is flattering now?" Gilbert asked; "but seriously, mother, you
LINE 185: shall accept an invitation to the Wells Palace, you must promise to do
LINE 186: so. The bishop said something about November, if you did not mind the
LINE 187: falling leaves."
LINE 188: "I shall wait till I am asked," Mrs. Arundel said. "If his lordship has
LINE 189: buried me in the dust of years--out of sight and out of mind--I don't
LINE 190: see why he should unearth me now."
LINE 191: "And yet you sent your son to call you to mind; now that is unfair,
LINE 192: mother. You urged me to go to the Palace at Wells, and now you won't
LINE 193: take advantage of what is growing out of it. But to go back to Falconer;
LINE 194: a stout, middle-aged gentleman, of small means and weak chest, wants to
LINE 195: travel for a year. The bishop suggested Mr. Falconer should give him his
LINE 196: son to lead about, as he had previously washed several black sheep to a
LINE 197: very fair whiteness, paying expenses, but no further remuneration. If
LINE 198: Melville can be got off under such auspices, it will be a grand step in
LINE 199: the right direction. Poor fellow! he has got into his head the absolute
LINE 200: necessity of seeing the world, and I, who know him pretty well, think
LINE 201: that there would be less danger of mischief if he were allowed to follow
LINE 202: his bent, than if he were to be forced to follow the pursuits of a
LINE 203: country life at Fair Acres, which he thinks it grand to despise. He
LINE 204: talks with amazing coolness of all he shall do when he _does_ come, and
LINE 205: till he has learned a lesson, he would be a frightful nuisance to them
LINE 206: all. The airs he gives himself to the poor old steward are preposterous;
LINE 207: but the worst thing about him is the way he speaks to his mother."
LINE 208: "What is she like?"
LINE 209: "She is a very good woman, rather priding herself on setting aside all
LINE 210: conventionality, and bustling about the house, and keeping everyone up
LINE 211: to their duty but her son! Is it not extraordinary? She has ruined him
LINE 212: with stupid indulgence, and yet she is strict enough with the rest--even
LINE 213: with----"
LINE 214: "Joyce!" His mother supplied the word with a smile.
LINE 215: "Yes, even with Joyce," he rejoined; but starting up, with an
LINE 216: exclamation of dismay:
LINE 217: "Did you know Maythorne was in Clifton, mother?"
LINE 218: Mrs. Arundel followed the direction of her son's eyes, and there on the
LINE 219: broken, uneven slopes which lay before Sion Hill, came Gratian, chatting
LINE 220: gaily to a man of some six-and-thirty or forty, who answered very well
LINE 221: to the description a poet gave some years after of "the dandy despot,
LINE 222: the jewelled mass of millinery, oiled and curled, and smelling of musk
LINE 223: and insolence."
LINE 224: "I am very sorry he has come to Clifton," Mrs. Arundel said quickly. "I
LINE 225: suppose he is at the hotel."
LINE 226: "Gratian looks satisfied. I hope I shan't get very savage with him,
LINE 227: mother. When we last parted it was the night when I--but I need not talk
LINE 228: about it--he got that weak, foolish boy into his hands, and I helped to
LINE 229: get him out, so he bears me a grudge."
LINE 230: "Never mind that, my dear son; and, Gilbert, remember an old watchword:
LINE 231: 'He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.'"
LINE 232: "I know I do flare out at Maythorne sometimes; but then was there not a
LINE 233: cause?"
LINE 234: "Ah! Gilbert, there is never a cause or an excuse for wrath indulged;
LINE 235: indignation against _wrong_ is one thing, rage against the wrong-doer
LINE 236: another."
LINE 237: And now steps were heard in the hall, and Gratian's laugh. She threw
LINE 238: open the door and said in a half-mocking tone:
LINE 239: "My Lord Maythorne."
LINE 240: Mrs. Arundel advanced to meet her brother, and greeted him kindly, but
LINE 241: with no profession of extreme delight.
LINE 242: "Well, my dear sister," Lord Maythorne said, "I have taken Clifton _en
LINE 243: route_ to Plymouth, and wandering aimlessly on the Downs I met your fair
LINE 244: visitor, my kinswoman, Gratian. What a quaint little snuggery you have
LINE 245: got, Annabella, upon my word; and Gratian tells me my hopeful nephew is
LINE 246: here, looking after his future prospects, eh? A little Methodism mixed
LINE 247: with law, eh?" And Lord Maythorne produced an elegant gold snuff-box,
LINE 248: tapped the lid, and took a delicate pinch between his forefinger and
LINE 249: thumb, in the most approved fashion of the time.
LINE 250: "Ha! Gilbert, how do? Where is your cub, that you were leading about
LINE 251: with such good intentions. Have you brought him to introduce to your
LINE 252: mother, eh?" Waiting for no answer, and just touching Gilbert's hand
LINE 253: with his finger tips, he went on:
LINE 254: "Have you dined, Annabella?"
LINE 255: "Long ago; we keep early hours."
LINE 256: "Well then, I'll return to my hotel to dine, and Gilbert shall accompany
LINE 257: me."
LINE 258: "No thank you," Gilbert said, "I shall sup with my mother, and go early
LINE 259: to bed."
LINE 260: "You had better accept the invitation, Gilbert. Our supper will not be
LINE 261: very recherch√©," Gratian said; "we do not sit down to a royal feast
LINE 262: here, we live above such vanities."
LINE 263: "I dare say he will not be fastidious after his farmhouse life," said
LINE 264: Lord Maythorne, scornfully. "How was your charge; is he walking without
LINE 265: leading strings yet?"
LINE 266: Gilbert bit his lip and struggled for composure; but his mother watched
LINE 267: him anxiously. Lord Maythorne's irony was hard for her to bear
LINE 268: sometimes, and she never knew how Gilbert would take it.
LINE 269: "My dear boy, there is a wise proverb which in English sounds a little
LINE 270: harsh, scarcely courteous; in French it is less abrupt: _'Chargez de vos
LINE 271: affaires.'_ There are other renderings: 'Don't put your fingers into
LINE 272: other people's pies.'"
LINE 273: Poor Gilbert sprang forward and raising his voice said:
LINE 274: "I will not submit to your impertinence. What right have you to treat me
LINE 275: like this? I saw you, a man almost double my age--"
LINE 276: "Gently, gently my dear boy, not _double_; nay, nay--"
LINE 277: "I say, I saw you trying to ruin a poor, weak fellow, who, weak as he
LINE 278: was, trusted you, and I tried to save him. I wonder you are not ashamed
LINE 279: to speak thus; you are--"
LINE 280: The fierce torrent of angry words suddenly stopped. His mother laid her
LINE 281: hand upon his arm, and with a great effort he regained his composure.
LINE 282: "I beg your pardon, mother, for brawling here, in your presence, and in
LINE 283: yours, Gratian, also; it is very unseemly."
LINE 284: A mocking laugh from Lord Maythorne was his only response, and Gratian
LINE 285: left the room saying:
LINE 286: "Adieu! I hope to find you in a better temper at supper, Gilbert," which
LINE 287: was scarcely less irritating.
LINE 288: Gilbert followed her, and left his mother and her brother together.
LINE 289: Lord Maythorne was an utterly selfish man of the world; he was the son
LINE 290: of his father's second marriage, and therefore much younger than Mrs.
LINE 291: Arundel. He was of the type very common in those days, of an openly
LINE 292: avowed scoffer at all that was good. Handsome, and with gentleman-like
LINE 293: manners when it suited him, he was unscrupulous as to truth, and could
LINE 294: send the shafts of his satire, dipped in gall, with a smiling face of
LINE 295: indifference. He took a strange pleasure in entrapping the weak and the
LINE 296: foolish, and as we know, poor Melville Falconer had not escaped.
LINE 297: Gilbert had been roused to indignation against his uncle, and pity for
LINE 298: his victim, and he had done his best to open Melville's eyes, and had
LINE 299: not altogether failed.
LINE 300: The straightforward manliness of Gilbert had an attraction for many
LINE 301: besides Melville, and without any pretension or assumption of
LINE 302: superiority, or many words about religion, he showed the Power that was
LINE 303: in him was sufficient for him. His hot temper was governed, and a
LINE 304: torrent of angry words was often checked; while he did his best to
LINE 305: trample out the dislike it was impossible not to feel for his uncle.
LINE 306: When Mrs. Arundel was left alone with her brother, he threw himself
LINE 307: carelessly on a sofa, and again drew out his snuff-box.
LINE 308: "So you have quite decided on the law for that boy," he said.
LINE 309: "Yes; this seems a good beginning here, and I have been able to article
LINE 310: him to a most respectable firm of solicitors."
LINE 311: "They are a dirty lot generally; however, I am glad that young fellow is
LINE 312: really going to earn his living, and make his own way in the world. It
LINE 313: would be a pity if he trusted to us."
LINE 314: "It is very unlikely he would trust to you," Mrs. Arundel said.
LINE 315: "It would be leaning on a broken reed, you think; well, I will not
LINE 316: contradict you, Annabella. In fact, I am a little short of cash, ready
LINE 317: cash, just now. I suppose you do not happen to have a hundred pounds you
LINE 318: don't know what to do with?"
LINE 319: "Certainly not; I cannot imagine, Maythorne, how you can think of such a
LINE 320: thing."
LINE 321: "Well, I know you send a lot to convert the niggers and Hindoos, and
LINE 322: that you subscribe to a society for the flinging about of Bibles, which
LINE 323: no one reads."
LINE 324: "Stop, please, Maythorne; I could not listen to any more conversation
LINE 325: like this; I will not take part in it. I can lend you no money; but once
LINE 326: more, for our father's sake, I cannot help begging, entreating you to
LINE 327: turn from the ways of sin."
LINE 328: "No cant, please, Annabella; it makes me savage, and I don't want to
LINE 329: affront you."
LINE 330: "I do not care whether you are affronted or not," Mrs. Arundel said,
LINE 331: earnestly. "I cannot help feeling that we are of the same blood, and
LINE 332: that if you were a worthy successor of my father you might be a joy and
LINE 333: support to me. Instead of this, I have to try to keep my son from your
LINE 334: influence, and dread that even by hearing your irreverent way of
LINE 335: treating sacred things, he may grow accustomed to what is wrong. Oh! it
LINE 336: is not too late; you are still a young man, still in your prime; let me
LINE 337: entreat you to break off the chains which bind you, or rather, turn to
LINE 338: God to free you from the bondage of sin--the _slavery_ of sin--for it is
LINE 339: slavery, Maythorne."
LINE 340: "I am very much obliged to you, Annabella, for your kindly interest, but
LINE 341: I rather prefer deeds to words. Maythornes is pretty well stripped of
LINE 342: trees now, and I have all but exhausted the possibility of raising money
LINE 343: on it; but _laisser aller_ is my motto, and I am not the one to mourn
LINE 344: over a dark, old-fashioned house, and lands which yield no produce; if
LINE 345: possible, I shall cut the whole concern. Well, ta-ta, till to-morrow. I
LINE 346: have promised to hire horses and trot out Gratian over the Downs."
LINE 347: Mrs. Arundel felt that to say anything more would be worse than useless,
LINE 348: and yet, as she watched her brother lounge across the road and stand on
LINE 349: the slope looking over the river, her eyes filled with tears.
LINE 350: "To think what he _might_ have been. May God guard my boy from men like
LINE 351: him."
LINE 352: Gilbert had gone quickly away from Sion Hill, and found himself on the
LINE 353: lower Downs--then not skirted by handsome houses, but with glades and
LINE 354: grassy slopes covered with hawthorn bushes, whitened in May-time with
LINE 355: blossoms like snow, and covered in autumn with feathery masses of the
LINE 356: wild clematis, or traveller's joy.
LINE 357: Gilbert found the place suited his mood, and he gave himself up to
LINE 358: thoughts of Joyce, and forgot the late encounter with his uncle.
LINE 359: How delightful it was to build castles for the future--to think of a
LINE 360: home near all this loveliness, where Joyce would reign in all her sweet
LINE 361: beauty as his wife. The time had been when Gilbert had admired his
LINE 362: cousin Gratian Anson, who was the daughter of his mother's aunt, and
LINE 363: therefore his cousin only in the second degree. Now her free, bold
LINE 364: bearing, her ringing voice, her fashionable dress and banter, jarred on
LINE 365: him. Her laugh was like the rattle of a noisy brook over innumerable
LINE 366: stones, when compared to Joyce's musical ripple, which was so real, and
LINE 367: so entirely the outcome of her own happiness. Then how charming was her
LINE 368: unconsciousness, and how her beauty was enhanced by the absence of all
LINE 369: affectation; how pretty was her affection for her father and Piers, and
LINE 370: how gracefully and simply she did all the little household duties which
LINE 371: her mother expected from her! Some words of a favourite poet of his
LINE 372: mother's recurred to him, as he pictured Joyce in her little, short,
LINE 373: lilac frock, with an apron, as he had seen her one morning, and her
LINE 374: round white arms bare, as she came out of the dairy, and said she had
LINE 375: made up twenty pats of butter while he had been asleep. Surely George
LINE 376: Herbert's words were verified.
LINE 377: The action was made fine by the spirit, which was done as a loving token
LINE 378: of obedience to the will of another.
LINE 379: "Mother wished me to do it, so I got up an hour earlier," she had said,
LINE 380: as she cut a slice from one of the rolls made for breakfast and offered
LINE 381: it to him, spread with the butter she had made, with a cup of milk,
LINE 382: before it had been skimmed.
LINE 383: Dreams of first love are very sweet; and Gilbert wondered if he had been
LINE 384: wise to leave Fair Acres without getting a definite answer from Joyce
LINE 385: herself.
LINE 386: Honourable and straightforward, he determined not to return to Fair
LINE 387: Acres unless prepared to ask her father's permission to lay all he had
LINE 388: at her feet. He was conscious that at present that _all_ did not imply
LINE 389: much, and besides, he had his mother to think of, and he must not marry
LINE 390: till he was really in a position to support a wife in that station of
LINE 391: life to which he had been called. He could wait for seven years, like
LINE 392: Jacob of old--waiting for Joyce was worth any sacrifice. But what if,
LINE 393: when she emerged from her retirement and went to Barley Wood, some one
LINE 394: else might set his heart on the prize and win it. Then he recalled her
LINE 395: words, spoken in answer to his question as he carried her towards home
LINE 396: the evening before:
LINE 397: "No; I will not forget you."
LINE 398: They seemed to possess a double meaning as he repeated them again and
LINE 399: again, as he retraced his steps over the observatory towards Sion Hill.
LINE 400: They were heard in the late voices of the thrushes in the woods across
LINE 401: the river--those dark, mysterious Leigh woods which, in the dim and
LINE 402: fading light, clothed the opposite heights with dim and motionless
LINE 403: masses; they were heard in the call of the sailor boys from the full
LINE 404: river below St. Vincent's Rock, on whose summit he stood; they seemed to
LINE 405: wrap him round with a certainty that the giant rock, from which he
LINE 406: looked over the fading landscape lying to his left, encircled by a line
LINE 407: of hills, on which the fine tower of Dundry stood like a black sentinel
LINE 408: against the clear sky, was not more steadfast than would Joyce's heart
LINE 409: be, were it once given to him.
LINE 410: There were then no railings to protect passers-by from approaching too
LINE 411: near the edge of the precipice which falls sheer down from this point a
LINE 412: distance of three hundred feet, and Gilbert was startled from his dream
LINE 413: by a voice near:
LINE 414: "You are perilously near the edge, unless you wish to go over!"
LINE 415: He turned with a sudden gesture, and, to his surprise, saw Gratian.
LINE 416: "I saw you wander over here from my window," she said. "Look! there are
LINE 417: our houses, and I came to look after you."
LINE 418: "That was very obliging," Gilbert said, a little satirically.
LINE 419: "Now, don't be so high and mighty. I wish to be your friend, as I have
LINE 420: always been, Gilbert. I was very sorry for you when you were so
LINE 421: shamefully teazed by your young uncle; he does not like to be called
LINE 422: _old_. I hope you noticed that."
LINE 423: "Oh! it is over now. I had no right to get into a rage."
LINE 424: "I think you had every right," Gratian said. "He is too provoking;
LINE 425: worse, since he has been so much in London, and welcomed, so we hear, by
LINE 426: some boon companions of His Majesty. But do not let us talk of him; let
LINE 427: us talk of you. No; I don't choose to walk so near the edge of the
LINE 428: rocks, if you do. Tell me about the people where you have been;--tell me
LINE 429: about the place. Is it a fine house, or a nice big farm? Fair Acres is a
LINE 430: pretty name, and are there no fair maidens as well as acres? Come,
LINE 431: Gilbert, you were not always so cross to me." This was said with a
LINE 432: gentle pressure on his arm.
LINE 433: "I don't mean to be cross; but there is nothing at Fair Acres that would
LINE 434: interest you. You know about poor Melville already."
LINE 435: "I have heard of him," she said, "and of your taking upon yourself to
LINE 436: reform him. Well, who are the others?"
LINE 437: "There are two fine boys, who want to be sailors, but they are too old,
LINE 438: I am afraid, for the navy; they are thirteen."
LINE 439: "They--both thirteen!"
LINE 440: "Yes, they are twins. Then there is a lame boy, Piers, a year younger.
LINE 441: And oh, I forgot! a quiet, silent fellow, Ralph, he is sixteen."
LINE 442: "And does the great Melville, come next to him?"
LINE 443: "Two little girls died. But there is a daughter of seventeen."
LINE 444: "Ah!" exclaimed Gratian; "I knew there was a daughter. Did I not tell
LINE 445: you I knew you were in love? Tell me her name. Come! We are such old
LINE 446: friends. Surely you might tell me."
LINE 447: "Really, Gratian, I will tell you Miss Falconer's name if you so
LINE 448: particularly wish to hear it. I--"
LINE 449: "I will guess it. Let me see. I love my love with an A, because she is
LINE 450: amiable, and I took her to the sign of the Archer, and fed her with
LINE 451: apples, and her name is Angela. Not right? Well, I will go through the
LINE 452: alphabet, and I must surely be right at last. I love my love with a
LINE 453: B----."
LINE 454: "Pray stop," Gilbert said. "I don't feel in a jesting mood, somehow."
LINE 455: "Not ready to wear a cap and bells? Poor Gilbert. You feel more like
LINE 456: sitting under a willow tree and singing 'Poor Mary Anne.'"
LINE 457: "Which is our house?" Gilbert asked.
LINE 458: "Not that one; not up the steps. But you shall not go in till you tell
LINE 459: me her name."
LINE 460: "She is called Joyce," Gilbert said, in despair.
LINE 461: "Ah! then you allow there is only one _she_ for you in all the world,
LINE 462: and _she_ is called Joyce."
LINE 463: "Now, I do hope you are satisfied," Gilbert said.
LINE 464: She laughed that loud, ringing laugh, as she ran upstairs before him.
LINE 465: "Oh! of course I am satisfied," she said.
