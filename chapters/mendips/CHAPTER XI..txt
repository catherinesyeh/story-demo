LINE 1: MEETING.
LINE 2: From the time of the Bishop's visit, Mrs. Falconer began to resume her
LINE 3: usual employments. She covered her crape with a large apron, and pinned
LINE 4: back the long "weepers" of her large widow's cap, and went about the
LINE 5: house again, with none of her old sprightly manner, but still going
LINE 6: through her duties in regular order.
LINE 7: It was a time which needed much patience, for, as was natural, Mrs.
LINE 8: Falconer saw many things which she considered neglected, and Joyce felt
LINE 9: herself held responsible for the misdemeanours of the maids, especially
LINE 10: of Susan Priday.
LINE 11: The schoolmistress at Mendip had given Susan an excellent character, and
LINE 12: Mrs. More had dictated a note to Joyce from her sick bed, telling her
LINE 13: that she believed Susan might really prove a friend as well as a
LINE 14: servant, for gratitude would be the spring of all her work, gratitude to
LINE 15: Joyce for taking her, and holding her free from all blame in her
LINE 16: father's ill-doings and bad life, which had apparently been the cause
LINE 17: of the great sorrow which had fallen upon Fair Acres.
LINE 18: Mrs. Falconer had consented with the cold apathetic consent which was
LINE 19: discouraging enough. She had taken little or no notice of Susan's
LINE 20: presence in the kitchen and dairy till she began to come forth from her
LINE 21: seclusion. Then, indeed, poor Susan had a hard time of it; but love, and
LINE 22: gratitude to Joyce, were too strong for her to show any resentment for
LINE 23: the many unjust suspicions and sharp reproofs which she had to bear.
LINE 24: "It's only what I must look for, Miss Joyce," she said one day, when the
LINE 25: breaking of a plate, which she had never touched, was at once laid to
LINE 26: her charge. "It's only what I must look for. My dear mother always used
LINE 27: to say, when poor father beat and ill-used her, that she remembered some
LINE 28: words of St. Peter, that if you were buffeted for doing _well_, that is,
LINE 29: doing your best, and took it patiently, it was acceptable in God's
LINE 30: sight. Besides, Miss Joyce, I have been used to hard words, and I know
LINE 31: how brokenhearted the poor mistress is; why, she is even a bit cross to
LINE 32: Master Piers and you, which is more than I can understand, for you are
LINE 33: next door to an angel, Miss Joyce."
LINE 34: "No, Susan I don't feel at all angelic. That is a mistake. I feel angry
LINE 35: and discontented sometimes, if I don't show it. There are so many
LINE 36: troubles which can't be talked of."
LINE 37: "Yes, miss, I know that well enough; but you can tell them to God, and
LINE 38: that's a rare comfort. Dozens of times in the day I tell Him of my
LINE 39: biggest trouble, that I have a father who----"
LINE 40: Susan stopped, threw her coarse apron over her head, and ran away to
LINE 41: scour the pans in the dairy till they shone like silver.
LINE 42: The bright November weather soon vanished, and the winter closed in
LINE 43: rapidly. Except for a visit of a few days from Miss Falconer and
LINE 44: Charlotte, nothing occurred to break the monotony of this dead time of
LINE 45: the year. Farming and gardening operations were suspended, and Ralph got
LINE 46: out his beloved books again, and Piers arranged and re-arranged his
LINE 47: large collection of curiosities, and Christmas drew near.
LINE 48: Joyce had given up listening for a footstep on the road, or looking
LINE 49: anxiously for the old postman, who trudged from Wells, on fine days,
LINE 50: with the letters, but in bad weather pleased himself as to the length of
LINE 51: his rounds.
LINE 52: Mrs. Falconer worked, and knitted, and darned, and, when the wind blew
LINE 53: fiercely round the house on the dark winter nights, thought of her
LINE 54: little Middies tossing about on the wide sea; and of Melville in that
LINE 55: far-off land, which she knew more by its shape of a boot on the map
LINE 56: Piers had hung up in his room, than by any distinct notion of what was
LINE 57: to be seen there.
LINE 58: Rome, Florence, Naples, were but names to her, and as dim and distant as
LINE 59: Haiphong or Hong Kong are to many in the present day.
LINE 60: 'Melville was in Italy,' and her interest in the country was expressed
LINE 61: in these words. Melville's letter, written on hearing of his father's
LINE 62: death, was sad enough. Weak natures like his, always find relief in
LINE 63: trouble by many words, and give vent to grief by vain protestations of
LINE 64: affection and of remorse.
LINE 65: Mrs. Falconer treasured the letter, and read it many times, and thought
LINE 66: Joyce unfeeling in expressing so little sympathy with her brother. There
LINE 67: could be no doubt that all his wilful disregard of his father's wishes
LINE 68: started up before Melville, now that it was too late to atone for them,
LINE 69: and for the time, as he said, "he was distracted with grief." But there
LINE 70: was no word of a desire to redeem the past by coming to Fair Acres and
LINE 71: doing his best to perform his duties there. Selfish people are not cured
LINE 72: by trouble of their selfishness. It commonly happens that they are more
LINE 73: selfish in their grief than in their joy, more self-absorbed by pain
LINE 74: than pleasure.
LINE 75: While Melville could write of his distracted condition, of his love for
LINE 76: his father, of his burning indignation against the wretch who had caused
LINE 77: his death, and of his determination to have him brought to justice,
LINE 78: Joyce was silent; only sometimes, when kneeling by Piers' bed, would she
LINE 79: allow her grief full vent; only when alone in the seat under the fir
LINE 80: trees would she cry out in the bitterness of her heart for the lost
LINE 81: father who had been so dear to her.
LINE 82: And there were other causes of trouble, which she could scarcely confess
LINE 83: to herself. Not another word had Gilbert Arundel written, not another
LINE 84: sign had he made of remembrance. She knew now, as the time went on, that
LINE 85: she loved him, and that, after all, she was nothing to him. How could
LINE 86: she have been so foolish? How often she had laughed at Charlotte's
LINE 87: fancied admirers, at her continual discovery that some one was in love
LINE 88: with her, but was kept back by circumstances from declaring his
LINE 89: devotion! For the minor canon was one of a long list of visionary
LINE 90: admirers, and he had been followed by the pale-faced clergyman she had
LINE 91: met at Barley Wood, about whom, during the few days Charlotte had spent
LINE 92: at Fair Acres, she had talked, till Joyce grew weary of the theme.
LINE 93: "Such nonsense!" she had said. "Besides, no girl ought to acknowledge
LINE 94: herself to be in love till she has had good reason given her. It is not
LINE 95: nice; it is not womanly."
LINE 96: And as day by day passed, and night after night, when she leaned against
LINE 97: the casement of her window, when the stars were throbbing and shining in
LINE 98: the deep-blue of the winter's sky, she had to confess, with deep
LINE 99: abasement of spirit, that she had been as weak as poor Charlotte, nay,
LINE 100: weaker; for as Charlotte's heroes fell from their pedestals, or vanished
LINE 101: into thin air like the mirage in the desert, she could always replace
LINE 102: them, and pour forth her romantic soul in verses addressed to new
LINE 103: objects, as if the old had never existed.
LINE 104: But Joyce told herself she must suffer the consequences of her weakness
LINE 105: for ever and a day. No one could ever again be to her what Gilbert had
LINE 106: been, in that first happy time of awakening love.
LINE 107: Joyce's pale cheeks and wistful eyes at last attracted her mother's
LINE 108: notice. In these days she would have been taken to see a doctor, ordered
LINE 109: change of air and scene, and put upon some _r√©gime_ as to food. But,
LINE 110: except in cases of severe illness, people did not resort to doctors as
LINE 111: they do now-a-days, and the nervous patients and chronic invalids,
LINE 112: resigned themselves to unlimited home physic, and took their poor health
LINE 113: as a matter of course.
LINE 114: "Joyce," Mrs. Falconer said, one day, early in February, when the season
LINE 115: of Christmas they had all dreaded so much was past; "Joyce, I think it
LINE 116: would do you good to spend a few days with Aunt Letitia at Wells."
LINE 117: Joyce tried to smile.
LINE 118: "I don't want to be done good to, mother; besides, I can't leave you."
LINE 119: "Yes, you can. Mr. Paget said yesterday you looked as if you wanted a
LINE 120: change. It's a wonder Mrs. More has not asked you to Barley Wood again."
LINE 121: "She has been so ill," Joyce said; "it is not likely she could invite
LINE 122: me."
LINE 123: "And then there is Mrs. Arundel and her niece that came here last fall;
LINE 124: not a word have we heard of them."
LINE 125: "Yes, mother; you forget. I have heard twice, about--about Lord
LINE 126: Maythorne. Mrs. Arundel has kept him from coming here again. Besides,
LINE 127: she is busy settling into a home, and besides----"
LINE 128: "I think it is very odd, Mr. Arundel has never written, or come here
LINE 129: again."
LINE 130: "He wrote to me once," Joyce said, in a low voice.
LINE 131: "Did you answer the letter?"
LINE 132: "No, mother," Joyce said, springing up quickly, and, with a great
LINE 133: effort, throwing off her sadness. "No; there was nothing to answer. But
LINE 134: I _will_ go and stay a day or two with Aunt Letitia, if you want to get
LINE 135: rid of me. Ralph can take a note in to Wells to-morrow, when he goes in
LINE 136: to the market. I shall only stay two days, but we must find out whether
LINE 137: Aunt Letitia wants me first."
LINE 138: Miss Falconer was really pleased that Joyce should propose a visit, and
LINE 139: the little guest-chamber in the Vicar's Close was made ready with
LINE 140: willing hands, and Charlotte hailed Joyce's appearance, that she might
LINE 141: tell her of all her hopes and fears.
LINE 142: Charlotte had been twice at the Palace during the winter. Mrs. Law,
LINE 143: gentle and kindly, had taken an interest in the young people in Wells,
LINE 144: and had invited Charlotte, amongst others, to tea. Tea at six o'clock,
LINE 145: on some day when the bishop and his chaplain and Mr. Henry Law, were
LINE 146: absent on some business in the diocese.
LINE 147: If it had been a great thing to visit Mrs. Hannah More at Barley Wood,
LINE 148: it was a greater to take tea at the palace. With the wigs of the last
LINE 149: and preceding century, the bishops have thrown off a great deal of the
LINE 150: episcopal state, which was once considered a part of the duty of the
LINE 151: peer spiritual. And a certain air of solemnity pervaded the Wells
LINE 152: palace, even when presided over by such true "gentlefolks" as the
LINE 153: bishop and Mrs. Law. That old-fashioned word seems to suit the host and
LINE 154: hostess at the Wells palace far better than any other term I could use.
LINE 155: That innate grace and refinement of feeling is sometimes, it is true,
LINE 156: acquired, but it is a plant of slow growth, especially amongst those,
LINE 157: who suddenly raised to a position of importance in the Church, feel the
LINE 158: elevation makes them a little dizzy. The Bishop's wife, then presiding
LINE 159: over the palace, had always moved in the higher circles of society, and,
LINE 160: therefore, neither at Carlisle nor Wells did she find it necessary to
LINE 161: impress upon humbler people that she stood on a vantage ground to which
LINE 162: few could approach. She was dignified, though she was gentle, and no one
LINE 163: would ever pass the barrier which divides familiarity, from free and
LINE 164: pleasant intercourse. Mrs. Law, like everyone else, was greatly taken
LINE 165: with Joyce Falconer; and again poor Charlotte began to feel that with no
LINE 166: effort at all her cousin was winning her way, and making an impression
LINE 167: which, with all her efforts, she felt she did not succeed in doing.
LINE 168: Miss Falconer was surprised when, the day after the girls had spent an
LINE 169: evening at the palace, Mrs. Law sent a little three-cornered note of
LINE 170: invitation to Joyce to spend Sunday at the palace before she returned
LINE 171: to Fair Acres. The footman waited for a reply, and the discussion of
LINE 172: Mrs. Law's note caused no little excitement in the parlour, of which the
LINE 173: servant, if he had been so minded, could have heard every word.
LINE 174: "My dear Joyce, what will you do? You have no suitable dress for such a
LINE 175: visit; and yet it is a pity to miss it. I really do not know what to
LINE 176: advise."
LINE 177: "I think I should like to go to the palace, Aunt Letitia," Joyce said.
LINE 178: "Like! yes; but are you prepared for such a visit?"
LINE 179: "Oh! yes; I have my best frock, the black bombazine, and my crape
LINE 180: bonnet. That need not hinder me."
LINE 181: "But, my dear, people in Mrs. Law's position wear evening gowns, with
LINE 182: low necks and short sleeves. _I_ have moved in these circles, and of
LINE 183: course----"
LINE 184: "We must not keep the servant waiting, Aunt Letitia; if you give me
LINE 185: leave, I should like to accept the invitation."
LINE 186: "Very well," said Miss Falconer; "there is my writing-case; take care
LINE 187: how you write; begin, 'Miss Joyce Falconer presents her respects.'"
LINE 188: "But Mrs. Law addresses me as, 'Dear Miss Falconer'; had I not better
LINE 189: begin, 'Dear Madam, or dear Mrs. Law'?"
LINE 190: "Oh! _not_ 'Dear Mrs. Law.' My dear child, how ignorant you are of
LINE 191: etiquette."
LINE 192: Joyce seated herself, and wrote a few words accepting the invitation
LINE 193: from Saturday to the Monday following, and took it herself to the
LINE 194: footman.
LINE 195: "You should have rung for Phoebe, really Joyce, my _dear_!" But it was
LINE 196: too late. Charlotte, who had been "composing" in the sitting-room
LINE 197: upstairs, had heard voices, and now came down just as Joyce had closed
LINE 198: the door on the footman from the palace.
LINE 199: "An invitation to _stay_ at the palace! Oh! Joyce, how fortunate you
LINE 200: are. Mrs. Law might have asked me!"
LINE 201: "She knows you live in the place, my love," said Miss Falconer.
LINE 202: Charlotte sighed. "If I did _not_ live here it would be all the same."
LINE 203: But Charlotte was really an amiable girl, and her devotion to Joyce was
LINE 204: sincere and true.
LINE 205: "Well," she said, "what will you wear, dear? Can I lend you any pretty
LINE 206: things? My amber beads--or--my filigree comb. Oh! I forgot! Of course,
LINE 207: you are still in deep black."
LINE 208: "It is very kind of you, Charlotte," Joyce said; "you always are kind;
LINE 209: but I don't want anything."
LINE 210: The whole of that day Joyce's visit to the palace engrossed the little
LINE 211: party in the Vicar's Close. Some cronies of Miss Falconer came in for a
LINE 212: gossip by the fireside, and were duly informed of the invitation, and
LINE 213: were duly congratulatory and a little jealous, although there was a
LINE 214: certain amount of satisfaction, that it was not Charlotte whom Mrs. Law
LINE 215: had delighted to honour.
LINE 216: It was a memorable visit to Joyce, and in a way she little expected. The
LINE 217: first evening passed pleasantly; and with a white muslin fichu, which
LINE 218: Miss Falconer insisted upon making for her, crossed over her black gown,
LINE 219: Joyce looked her best. The sleeves of best gowns in those days were cut
LINE 220: rather short, and Joyce wore on her round, white arms a pair of black
LINE 221: lace mittens, which Charlotte had lent her.
LINE 222: Her beautiful hair needed no adornment; it fell round her forehead in
LINE 223: natural curls, and was piled up without the help of cushions or
LINE 224: frizzettes, a natural crown of chesnut and gold. As at Barley Wood, so
LINE 225: at the palace; Joyce was too simple-minded to be stiff or constrained in
LINE 226: manner, and she conversed so pleasantly with a young son of the bishop,
LINE 227: who gave her his arm when they went to dinner, that he, in his turn, did
LINE 228: his best to be agreeable, and she was soon telling him of her little
LINE 229: sailor brothers, of Piers and his collection of butterflies, of Ralph
LINE 230: and his love of study, and the brave way in which he had come to live
LINE 231: at Fair Acres and do his best to turn into a farmer.
LINE 232: If the Saturday evenings were pleasant, how delightful was the Sunday,
LINE 233: when, in the sunshine of the early February day, the party from the
LINE 234: palace crossed to the cloister door, and went to the morning service in
LINE 235: the cathedral. It has been said of Wells that it is always Sunday there;
LINE 236: no sounds but the ringing of bells for service; no business, and no
LINE 237: traffic in the streets. But certain it is, that nowhere is the real
LINE 238: Sabbath stillness more profound, nor more refreshing to the tired in
LINE 239: spirit, on a day like that February day, when Joyce was seated in the
LINE 240: high pew belonging to the Bishop. The cathedral is always a vision of
LINE 241: beauty, and when the swelling of the organ and the voices of the
LINE 242: choristers are hushed, and a pause occurs after the benediction has been
LINE 243: pronounced, the sounds without the building seem in direct harmony with
LINE 244: those within; for the Lady Chapel abuts on the lawn of the Sub-Dean's
LINE 245: residence, where the waters of St. Joseph's Well lie deep; and there is
LINE 246: the murmur of the streams, the chirp of birds, the soft coo of pigeons,
LINE 247: and the distinct chatter of the jackdaw from the West front.
LINE 248: Joyce went out of the cathedral filled with peaceful thoughts of the
LINE 249: temple, of which this was but the faint shadow, the temple which has no
LINE 250: need of the sun to lighten it, for the Lamb is the light thereof.
LINE 251: Quite forgetting that she ought to turn towards the cloisters, Joyce
LINE 252: walked on down the nave before the Bishop's party had missed her. The
LINE 253: sweet seriousness of her face as she went out into the sunshine almost
LINE 254: held back the welcome, which was trembling on the lips of someone who
LINE 255: was standing near the porch, and had watched her coming down the wide
LINE 256: nave.
LINE 257: She was passing out, wrapt in her own meditations when Gilbert Arundel
LINE 258: put out his hand:
LINE 259: "Joyce!"
LINE 260: She started, and blushed rosy red.
LINE 261: "You did forget me, then!" he exclaimed, reproachfully.
LINE 262: "Forget you, no."
LINE 263: "You did not reply to my letter?"
LINE 264: "You did not ask me to write."
LINE 265: They now found themselves by the turnstile under the old clock, that
LINE 266: quaint clock which, it is said, was made to strike many times in
LINE 267: succession for the amusement of that gracious and sagacious King James,
LINE 268: who laughed till his sides ached, as the old knights, in their black
LINE 269: armour, hit the bell with their battle-axes, beneath the suggestive
LINE 270: motto, "Ne quid pereat." They hit it now with, all their wonted vigour
LINE 271: four times, and then the clock struck _one_.
LINE 272: [Illustration: Clock at Wells]
LINE 273: "We have come the wrong way. I am staying at the palace till to-morrow,"
LINE 274: Joyce said.
LINE 275: "At the palace! I am glad to hear it; but your mother, whom I saw
LINE 276: yesterday, did not know it."
LINE 277: "No; it was a sudden thought. I mean Mrs. Law only asked me on Friday."
LINE 278: "I am glad you are at the palace," Gilbert said. "I know I shall have a
LINE 279: friend in the Bishop."
LINE 280: Joyce made no remark to this, and they retraced their steps in silence
LINE 281: till they had crossed the drawbridge and were in the palace grounds.
LINE 282: "I have thought so much of you," he said, earnestly. "I am now come, as
LINE 283: I said I should, to present my petition. Is there any hope?"
LINE 284: Joyce turned away her head, and did not answer.
LINE 285: When they reached the palace, a footman threw open the door:
LINE 286: "Dinner is served," he said, in a voice which was intended to be a mild
LINE 287: reproof.
LINE 288: "Can I see his lordship?" Gilbert asked; while Joyce ran upstairs to her
LINE 289: room on the upper floor.
LINE 290: "His lordship is just sitting down to dinner, sir. What name----"
LINE 291: Gilbert took out a card and handed it to the man, leaving him in the
LINE 292: hall till he knew the Bishop's will.
LINE 293: Presently he reappeared.
LINE 294: "I am requested to beg you, sir, to go into the dining-room at once:
LINE 295: this way."
LINE 296: The Bishop rose, and gave Gilbert Arundel a very different greeting
LINE 297: from that which he had granted Lord Maythorne.
LINE 298: "My dear young friend, welcome for your _mother's_ sake, always welcome,
LINE 299: and for your own. How could you doubt it? Why stand on ceremony? But we
LINE 300: are in some distress," he said, with a sly twinkle in his eye; "we have
LINE 301: lost a young lady: she vanished into thin air as we left the cathedral.
LINE 302: Perhaps some knight-errant has carried her off. Ah! I see you know
LINE 303: something about her. Well, sit down; and, Barker," to one of the
LINE 304: servants, "Miss Falconer's place next Mr. Arundel's."
LINE 305: The Bishop dearly loved a little love affair, and he fancied he descried
LINE 306: one in "the air."
LINE 307: It was a great trial of Joyce's self-possession when the door of the
LINE 308: dining-room was opened for her by a servant, and she had to pass to her
LINE 309: place at the long dining-table. The Bishop's son came to the rescue,
LINE 310: making room for her by standing up and showing her the vacant place.
LINE 311: "I am sorry I was late," she said.
LINE 312: "It is a lovely day," was the rejoinder. "I do not wonder that you took
LINE 313: a turn after service."
LINE 314: "Yes," said Mrs. Law, kindly. "I saw your cousin in the cathedral, and I
LINE 315: thought it probable that you would walk home with her."
LINE 316: "No," Joyce said, in a low voice, "I did not go home with Charlotte."
LINE 317: One person at least appreciated the honesty of this confession, and
LINE 318: Gilbert told himself that it was a part of Joyce's crystal transparency
LINE 319: of character, that she would not even allow an assertion about herself
LINE 320: to pass if it were not absolutely true.
LINE 321: When Joyce was sitting after dinner, with Mrs. Law and several ladies,
LINE 322: in the long gallery, the Bishop's son brought her a message.
LINE 323: "My father would like to see you in his study for a few minutes. Will
LINE 324: you kindly follow me?"
LINE 325: Joyce obeyed, but her heart beat fast, and she dreaded what the Bishop
LINE 326: might have to say to her. Something about Melville; some bad news of the
LINE 327: little Middies: her thoughts flew in all directions.
LINE 328: The Bishop had already seated himself in his crimson leather chair, and,
LINE 329: when Mr. Law closed the door, she found herself alone with his lordship.
LINE 330: "My dear young lady," he said, in his slow, sonorous tones, "as I know
LINE 331: you are, alas! fatherless, will you allow me to stand, for the moment,
LINE 332: in the place of a father? A young gentleman, the son of an old friend,
LINE 333: has told me to-day that he seeks the honour of paying his addresses to
LINE 334: you. He went to Fair Acres last night and received your mother's
LINE 335: sanction, tempered, no doubt, with the natural pain of losing you. But
LINE 336: she gives her consent, and I venture to endorse it. As chief pastor and
LINE 337: father of the diocese, over which I have so recently come to preside, I
LINE 338: do earnestly commend to you the son of my old friend, Gilbert Arundel. I
LINE 339: propose that you should take a ramble together after service, in the
LINE 340: spring twilight, and when we meet at the evening meal, I hope I may find
LINE 341: you have made my young friend happy."
LINE 342: The Bishop's speech may sound to us unnecessarily long and formal, but,
LINE 343: sixty years ago, the old spirit of chivalrous respect towards maidens,
LINE 344: in approaching the subject of marriage, had not then died out. Perhaps,
LINE 345: also, in the time of the good Bishop, when the first gentleman in Europe
LINE 346: was setting so wretched an example in his behaviour, good and honourable
LINE 347: men felt it the more incumbent on them to give the woman the full
LINE 348: privileges of her position.
LINE 349: Love was to be sought as a favour granted, not claimed in a careless
LINE 350: fashion as a right; while the whole aspect of courtship and marriage was
LINE 351: dealt with more seriously than it is in our day.
LINE 352: Barriers are more easily broken down than set up again, and, perhaps,
LINE 353: there is too great a tendency now-a-days to treat what is grave as a
LINE 354: jest, and to show but little inclination to tread in the paths which
LINE 355: our mothers and grandmothers found safe. Thus the Bishop, when he had
LINE 356: heard from Gilbert's lips the object of his visit to Wells, thought it
LINE 357: his duty to speak to Joyce in the grave manner I have described.
LINE 358: The Bishop rose from his chair, and, laying his hand on Joyce's head,
LINE 359: solemnly pronounced a blessing, and, with crimson cheek and bowed head,
LINE 360: she left him, to prepare to go to the afternoon service.
LINE 361: Later in the day, the supreme moment in her young life came, when she
LINE 362: walked with Gilbert in the fields towards Dinder, turning to the left,
LINE 363: where, in a tangled copse, the first budding flowers of the starry
LINE 364: celandines were peeping amidst fallen leaves and mosses.
LINE 365: The clustering primrose buds were hardly yet showing themselves amongst
LINE 366: their crinkled leaves, and only the upright stems of the alders, and the
LINE 367: lowest boughs of the maples and hazel bushes displayed the first emerald
LINE 368: green of spring. It was a time and place for the exchange of first young
LINE 369: love, and confidences never to be forgotten.
LINE 370: And in all the changes and chances of her future life, Joyce could look
LINE 371: back to that first spring afternoon, and say from her heart that it was
LINE 372: the opening for her of a new and beautiful chapter. If the hopes of the
LINE 373: earlier days of their acquaintance had lain dormant during the winter,
LINE 374: they now sprang up with the coming life of the spring time, and were
LINE 375: sweet with the promise of the future.
LINE 376: When once Gilbert had found voice to tell his story he was eloquent, and
LINE 377: when once Joyce had given her response there was no further need for
LINE 378: reticence.
LINE 379: "And why did you not write to me?" he asked.
LINE 380: "As I said, because you did not ask me; and then when your uncle came,
LINE 381: he told me that you cared for Miss Anson; and I thought, _half_ thought,
LINE 382: it might be true."
LINE 383: Gilbert made an impatient gesture.
LINE 384: "You only _half_ thought so; you knew, Joyce, you knew better. So," he
LINE 385: went on under his breath, "that is the mischief he went to Fair Acres to
LINE 386: work. My mother soon stopped him from daring to persecute you."
LINE 387: "Mr. Paget and Mr. Gill said there was no lawful claim on poor Melville,
LINE 388: for the money had been lent him to gamble with, and that Lord Maythorne
LINE 389: knew he had no just claim to it."
LINE 390: "Of course he knew it; he thought he would frighten you, and your poor
LINE 391: mother. But let us not speak more of him."
LINE 392: "I wonder what will be done when Melville comes home, for I suppose he
LINE 393: will come home in the summer."
LINE 394: "Yes; perhaps he may have turned over a new leaf, as the children say;
LINE 395: anyhow, I can't help being grateful to Melville."
LINE 396: "To Melville?" she said.
LINE 397: "Yes; for was it not he who invited me to Fair Acres, to find _you_, my
LINE 398: darling."
LINE 399: Then he drew her closer, and with her hand in his arm, they walked
LINE 400: through the quiet fields back to the little city.
LINE 401: The cathedral stood up in a dark mysterious mass against the clear sky.
LINE 402: The last purple gleam was dying from the distant hills which encircle
LINE 403: Wells; Venus hung her silver lamp over the central tower of the
LINE 404: cathedral, and the whole scene was one of infinite peace.
LINE 405: They did not speak of the future, the present was sufficient for them;
LINE 406: but the cry of Joyce's heart, even in its happiness, found words:
LINE 407: "Oh! that my father knew."
LINE 408: "He may know, my darling," Gilbert said; "and I think we may rest in the
LINE 409: certainty that if he were here he would give me a welcome."
LINE 410: "Yes," Joyce said, softly; "yes, I know he would. Oh! dear father."
LINE 411: PART II.
LINE 412: AFTER MANY DAYS.
LINE 413: 'Tis Nature's plan
LINE 414: The child should grow into the man;
LINE 415: The man grow wrinkled, old, and grey.
LINE 416: In youth the heart exults and sings,
LINE 417: The pulses leap, the feet have wings;
LINE 418: In age the cricket chirps and brings
LINE 419: The harvest home of day.
