LINE 1: THE CITY OF THE DEEP SPRINGS.
LINE 2: The squire's high "four-wheel" drew up before the door of the Swan Hotel
LINE 3: at Wells about twelve o'clock that day. Mr. Falconer was well-known
LINE 4: there, and there was a general rush to meet him. The landlord came
LINE 5: briskly to the side of the vehicle to assist Miss Joyce to alight, while
LINE 6: the ostler and stable-boy ran to the head of the mare; and in the dark
LINE 7: entrance below the portico the landlady and a waiter with a napkin over
LINE 8: his arm, were in readiness.
LINE 9: "Good-day to you," said the squire, in a cheery voice.
LINE 10: "We are proud to see you, sir. Nice weather for the hay. Will you please
LINE 11: to walk in, sir? and Mrs. Maltby will receive your orders for dinner."
LINE 12: "Thank ye kindly. Dinner for two at one o'clock. My daughter will go up
LINE 13: to the Liberty, to her aunt's."
LINE 14: "Here, you fellow," exclaimed the prototype of the first gentleman in
LINE 15: Europe. "Here, can't you get the carriage nearer the pavement? I don't
LINE 16: care to set my foot in that puddle."
LINE 17: The ostler backed the horse, and the landlord advanced to give Melville
LINE 18: his arm, while a knot of people had assembled in Saddler Street,
LINE 19: watching with some curiosity the movements of the smart young gentleman
LINE 20: in the back seat.
LINE 21: The squire, provoked at the tone in which his son had spoken, vanished
LINE 22: within the dark lobby of the inn, while Joyce said, laughing:
LINE 23: "Melville, surely you don't want to be helped from the carriage!"
LINE 24: "Look at 'im, now," said a poor woman, who was carrying a basket of
LINE 25: vegetables to one of the Canon's houses; "did ye ever see the like? His
LINE 26: shoes are made of paper; and, lor! what bows!"
LINE 27: "Take care; you'll be heerd," said an old man, who was leaning on his
LINE 28: stick. "Take care. Don't 'ee chatter like a magpie. You'll be heerd,
LINE 29: Peggy Loxley."
LINE 30: "Ha, ha!" laughed the woman, "I know why you are affrighted; I know.
LINE 31: You've got your 'nephy' up to-day afore the justices, and you don't want
LINE 32: to affront one of the justices; I see."
LINE 33: The old man shook his stick at the woman, and meantime Melville had
LINE 34: accomplished his descent without splashing his shoes or the edge of his
LINE 35: trowsers.
LINE 36: "I shall want a post-chaise ready, in the afternoon, after the Bath mail
LINE 37: arrives," he said. "I expect a friend by the coach."
LINE 38: "Very good, sir," said the landlord, who now reappeared; "very good. The
LINE 39: squire has ordered dinner for two at one o'clock."
LINE 40: "Where are you off to, Joyce?" Melville said.
LINE 41: "I am going to do some shopping, and to wait at Aunt Letitia's for
LINE 42: father." Then Joyce drew a little nearer Melville. "Why can't your
LINE 43: friend ride with you in the back seat?"
LINE 44: "Why? Because I don't choose to let him jog over the roads in such a
LINE 45: rough conveyance."
LINE 46: Joyce's lip curled.
LINE 47: "It is good enough for father and for me," she said, "and ought to be
LINE 48: good enough for you."
LINE 49: Melville arranged his hair, and touched the ends of his lace cravat.
LINE 50: "My dear child, don't make a scene before witnesses, I beseech you."
LINE 51: Joyce waited to hear no more, but tripped away, turning, through a
LINE 52: quaint archway, to the Cathedral Green, where the cathedral stood
LINE 53: before her in all its majesty.
LINE 54: The great west front of Wells Cathedral has few rivals, and dull indeed
LINE 55: must be the heart that does not respond in some measure to its grandeur.
LINE 56: Involuntarily Joyce said, "How beautiful!" and then, leaving the road,
LINE 57: she passed through a turnstile and pursued her way under the shadow of a
LINE 58: row of limes, which skirted the wide expanse of turf before the
LINE 59: cathedral.
LINE 60: The blue sky of the summer day over-arched the stately church, and a few
LINE 61: white clouds sailed above the central tower. There were no jarring
LINE 62: sounds of wheels, no tread of many feet, no traffic which could tell of
LINE 63: trade. Although it was high noontide, the stillness was profound: the
LINE 64: jackdaw's cry, the distant voices of children in the market-square, the
LINE 65: rustle of the leaves in the trees, and a faint murmur of tinkling water,
LINE 66: only seemed to make the quiet more quiet, the silence more complete.
LINE 67: The great west door was open, and Joyce walked towards it, and passed
LINE 68: under it into the cool shadows of the nave. She had often done this
LINE 69: before, going out from the north porch into the Close again, but to-day
LINE 70: there seemed, she scarcely knew why, the stirring of a new life within
LINE 71: her.
LINE 72: [Illustration: Wells Cathedral.]
LINE 73: It was the moment, perhaps, of crossing the barrier which divides
LINE 74: childhood from womanhood; the pause which comes in most young lives,
LINE 75: when there is, as it were, a hush before the dawn of the coming day.
LINE 76: Joyce had been silent during the drive from Fair Acres; her father had
LINE 77: invited no conversation, and a glance now and then at his profile as he
LINE 78: sat on the high box seat at her side, had convinced Joyce that the lines
LINE 79: of care on his forehead were not traced there without a reason.
LINE 80: The fop, who condescended to sit in the back seat of the cumbrous
LINE 81: vehicle, indulged in sundry grumbles at the bad road, the dust, the slow
LINE 82: pace of Mavis the mare, the heat, and such like trifles, which were,
LINE 83: however, sufficient to disturb the serenity of Melville Falconer.
LINE 84: Joyce had felt ashamed and annoyed as she had never done before; and
LINE 85: when a neighbouring squire jogged past on horseback with his son, and
LINE 86: looked back with a smile at the highly-decorated figure in the back
LINE 87: seat, Joyce felt sure they were laughing at him! Why could not Melville
LINE 88: wear a short riding coat like Charlie Paget, and top-boots, and bear
LINE 89: himself like a country gentleman, instead of bringing down London
LINE 90: fashions into the heart of Somersetshire, and finding fault with
LINE 91: everything in his own home; bring his fine friends there without
LINE 92: warning, and behave as if he were indeed monarch of all he surveyed.
LINE 93: Joyce's sweet young face was shadowed with the awakening sense of
LINE 94: responsibility and the longing to do something, which might smooth the
LINE 95: rough places in her father's life, which her brother apparently made
LINE 96: without the slightest compunction.
LINE 97: As Joyce stood in the cathedral, not far from the north porch, her head
LINE 98: raised towards the belfry-tower, which the great inverted arches
LINE 99: support, a ray of sunshine entering at a window in the south transept
LINE 100: touched her figure, and illuminated it with a subdued and chastened
LINE 101: beauty. Her head was thrown back, and the high coal-scuttle or gipsy
LINE 102: bonnet did not hide the sweet face, which, when she had walked demurely
LINE 103: down the nave, had been hardly visible.
LINE 104: The little quaint figure was motionless, and the old verger turned twice
LINE 105: to look at it, with a strange and curious thrill of admiration.
LINE 106: Presently the cloister door opposite opened, and the Dean's swift
LINE 107: footsteps were heard approaching, with a regular pit-pat, on the floor
LINE 108: of the nave.
LINE 109: He, like the verger, was attracted by Joyce's attitude and the rapt
LINE 110: expression on her fair face.
LINE 111: "Why, it's Falconer's little girl!" he thought. "She is generally all
LINE 112: smiles and sunshine; now she looks like a nun."
LINE 113: As the Dean passed her, Joyce started. The brightest colour came to her
LINE 114: face, and she turned hastily towards the north porch.
LINE 115: The Dean, with old-fashioned and chivalrous courtesy, held the little
LINE 116: door, which was cut out of the big one for ordinary use, to let her
LINE 117: pass, and then he said:
LINE 118: "Miss Falconer, I think. I hope your good father is well. Is he in Wells
LINE 119: to-day?"
LINE 120: "Yes, sir," Joyce replied, bright smiles rippling over her face. "Yes,
LINE 121: sir; on magistrates' business."
LINE 122: "Ah, ah! I heard there was some bad case brought in from Mendip. The
LINE 123: good lady at Barley Wood will have to learn that much prating about
LINE 124: religion ain't what we want. It's like the crackling of thorns under the
LINE 125: pot. Let us see you at the Deanery before long; make my compliments to
LINE 126: your good father and Mrs. Falconer." And then the Dean ambled away, his
LINE 127: thin, black-stockinged legs beneath the decanal coat and apron giving
LINE 128: him the appearance of a black stork.
LINE 129: Joyce now hastened towards the Vicar's Close, where her aunt, her
LINE 130: father's only sister, lived.
LINE 131: The Vicar's Close at Wells is a sight to delight the heart of the
LINE 132: antiquary and the lover of ancient buildings and olden times.
LINE 133: It is entered from the north end of the cathedral by a wide, low
LINE 134: gateway, and on either side of a fairly broad footway stands a row of
LINE 135: small, picturesque houses with twisted chimneys and low doorways, round
LINE 136: which the clematis and honeysuckle climb at their own sweet will. The
LINE 137: Vicar's Close, at the further end, is closed in by a small chapel, which
LINE 138: entirely blocks the entrance, for any but foot passengers, who obtain
LINE 139: egress into the North Liberty by some uneven stone steps at the side of
LINE 140: the chapel, leading into the road a few feet above the level of the
LINE 141: Close.
LINE 142: If Wells is quiet outside the Vicar's Close, it is quiet indeed within
LINE 143: it. Since the summer day when Joyce went into the little garden before a
LINE 144: house half-way up on the right side, the hand of the modern Wells
LINE 145: builder and plasterer may have marred the complete effect, with stucco
LINE 146: and sash-windows; but for the most part the houses in the second decade
LINE 147: of the century were guiltless of plate glass and white-wash, and their
LINE 148: antique frontage was, even more than now, one of the most picturesque
LINE 149: features of the city of Wells.
LINE 150: Joyce had scarcely touched the bright brass handle of the bell when the
LINE 151: door opened, and a girl of two or three and twenty sprang out.
LINE 152: "Oh, Joyce, how glad I am to see you! Come in Aunt Letitia, here is
LINE 153: Joyce."
LINE 154: Miss Falconer was in the parlour on the right-hand side of the little,
LINE 155: low-roofed lobby, and rose somewhat feebly from her chair by the wide
LINE 156: grate, which was gay with pots of flowers and evergreens.
LINE 157: "Well, my child, welcome. Have you come to Wells with your father?"
LINE 158: "Yes, auntie; and I am come here for dinner, and after dinner may
LINE 159: Charlotte come and do some shopping with me? I have a long list of
LINE 160: commissions at the china shop and at Wilmott's."
LINE 161: "Charlotte will be pleased to accompany you, dear child; and when you
LINE 162: have taken off your bonnet, come and tell me home news."
LINE 163: There were not many stairs to ascend to Charlotte's bedroom, which
LINE 164: looked into the gardens at the back of two other houses of some
LINE 165: pretension, between the Vicar's Close and the Deanery.
LINE 166: Charlotte curled herself up in the deep window-seat, and watched her
LINE 167: cousin as she laid aside her large bonnet, smoothed her hair, and
LINE 168: arranged her white pelerine over her pelisse. Charlotte had a genuine,
LINE 169: if rather romantic, admiration for her cousin Joyce. Though a good girl,
LINE 170: she was somewhat given to sentiment and languishing, complained of being
LINE 171: fatigued, of headaches, and low spirits. She fed upon romance and
LINE 172: poetry--the poetry of albums and keepsakes, which was then
LINE 173: fashionable. Of course she had a hero who figured in her day-dreams; and
LINE 174: she would spend hours at the little window of the sitting-room to catch
LINE 175: a sight of him as he passed along the Close. Charlotte would have been
LINE 176: much better for some active employment; but Miss Falconer was getting
LINE 177: old and feeble in health, and if Charlotte was obedient and gentle, she
LINE 178: was well satisfied. So she worked covers in cross-stitch for the chairs,
LINE 179: knitted her own stockings, read all the light literature which came in
LINE 180: her way, and played on the cabinet piano which stood against the wall in
LINE 181: the sitting-room, with its crimson silk front gathered into the centre
LINE 182: by a large rosette, and displaying, when open, a very narrow keyboard
LINE 183: with very yellow keys.
LINE 184: [Illustration: The Vicar's Close, Wells.]
LINE 185: "How sweetly pretty you look to-day, Joyce. I can't help saying so.
LINE 186: Don't be angry. I want to read you some verses I have written, called,
LINE 187: 'The Drooping Rosebud.'" And Charlotte took out of her pocket the
LINE 188: crumpled page of a copy-book.
LINE 189: "You had better not read it now, Charlotte; Aunt Letitia will expect us
LINE 190: to go downstairs."
LINE 191: "Only the first verse," Charlotte said, and then she began:
LINE 192: "'She bent her head in sorrow,
LINE 193: The pretty fragile rose;
LINE 194: She languished for the morrow,
LINE 195: Where light and gladness grows
LINE 196: She languished for a rain drop
LINE 197: To cheer her thirsty heart:
LINE 198: She was so sad and weary;
LINE 199: In joy she had no part.
LINE 200: 'As the raindrop to the rosebud,
LINE 201: So is his smile to me;
LINE 202: As----'"
LINE 203: Here Charlotte stopped and blushed. "You know who I mean by the rosebud,
LINE 204: and who the raindrop is?"
LINE 205: Joyce laughed merrily.
LINE 206: "Oh, Charlotte, you must not come to me for sympathy. I can't understand
LINE 207: such sentiment. You have never spoken to Mr. Bamfylde in your life."
LINE 208: "_Not spoken_; no, but there is such a thing as the language of eyes.
LINE 209: Joyce, you don't understand."
LINE 210: "No, I don't; and I think, Charlotte, it is nonsense to waste your
LINE 211: thoughts on Mr. Bamfylde, who probably has never given you a thought in
LINE 212: his life."
LINE 213: "I am not so sure about _thoughts_, dear. However, I see you don't care
LINE 214: about it, or my verses, or me."
LINE 215: "Come, Charlotte, don't be silly! Of course I care about you, but I
LINE 216: don't think I am poetical or romantic. Indeed, we ought to go
LINE 217: downstairs."
LINE 218: "You must go first, and I will follow," said poor Charlotte, putting
LINE 219: "The Drooping Rosebud" in her pocket again, with a sigh; and Joyce
LINE 220: tripped downstairs alone.
LINE 221: "Well, my little rustic," Miss Falconer said; "come and sit down by me,
LINE 222: and tell me the news."
LINE 223: "Melville came home last week," Joyce said. "He is determined to travel,
LINE 224: and father did so want him to settle down at home and help him with the
LINE 225: estate. But, oh! Aunt Lettice, nothing will ever make him into a farmer.
LINE 226: He is dressed to-day, to come into Wells, like a fine gentleman. I get
LINE 227: so angry with Melville, Aunt Lettice."
LINE 228: "He will come round in time, my dear. Young men are often a little
LINE 229: difficult to manage, and then sober down so wonderfully."
LINE 230: "But Melville is twenty-three, nearly twenty-four, Aunt Lettice. Father
LINE 231: has given him every advantage, and all he wished for, and now he says he
LINE 232: cannot possibly live a country gentleman's life."
LINE 233: "Oxford was a poor preparation for that life, I must own," said Miss
LINE 234: Falconer; "only it was natural perhaps, that your father should yield
LINE 235: to your mother's wishes."
LINE 236: "Mother suffers the most," said Joyce hotly, "far, far the most. It
LINE 237: makes me so angry when I think of the way mother is treated."
LINE 238: "My dear child, she has spoiled Melville, and this is the result."
LINE 239: "It would not be the result if Melville had an atom of gentleman-like
LINE 240: feeling. Looking down on mother, who----" Joyce's voice faltered.
LINE 241: "It was unfortunate that your father married below him in the social
LINE 242: scale; he was caught in the rebound, as we say. But all that is over and
LINE 243: done with: still, we may deplore it; though no one can respect your dear
LINE 244: mother more than I do. Marriage," said Miss Falconer, slowly and
LINE 245: deliberately, "has not been successful in our family. Charlotte's
LINE 246: mother, our only sister, made a very unwise marriage, and her only child
LINE 247: has been thrown upon me to support. Not that I regret it. Charlotte is
LINE 248: an amiable, gentle girl, and a companion to me. I have given her such
LINE 249: advantages as I could afford, and she is fairly accomplished. I had a
LINE 250: visitor yesterday I little expected, at her very advanced age. Mrs.
LINE 251: Hannah More paid her first call on our new Bishop, and was so obliging
LINE 252: as to come on here. She was speaking of you with interest, my dear."
LINE 253: "Of me!" exclaimed Joyce. "What does she know of me?"
LINE 254: "She knows about most people in the county; and, naturally, your
LINE 255: mother's opposition to Mrs. More's views has reached her. She forbade a
LINE 256: dairy-maid to read, who had once been in Mrs. More's school, and when
LINE 257: she disobeyed her, dismissed her on the spot. It was much to be
LINE 258: regretted. Greatly as I respect your mother, I must confess this act
LINE 259: annoyed me."
LINE 260: "Did Mrs. More mention it yesterday, Aunt Lettice?"
LINE 261: "Yes; and she said she would like to have some communication with you.
LINE 262: She had seen you riding with your father, and was taken by your looks.
LINE 263: She inquired what education you had, and was shocked when I told her
LINE 264: absolutely none. I told her I had implored your father to send you to a
LINE 265: boarding-school at Clifton, but that he was obstinate. For, with all his
LINE 266: good qualities, Joyce, we must concede that your father _is_ obstinate."
LINE 267: "He is determined to do what is right," said Joyce, "if that is
LINE 268: obstinacy."
LINE 269: Miss Falconer smiled.
LINE 270: "I have known him longer than you have, little Joyce," she said. "But
LINE 271: tell me about this proposition of Mrs. More's: is it possible to carry
LINE 272: it out? Mrs. More has such frequent attacks of illness, that it is well
LINE 273: to lose no time. Shall I write to Mrs. More, and propose that you should
LINE 274: spend a week at Barley Wood?"
LINE 275: "Oh! I don't think mother could spare me for a week. Did Mrs. More ask
LINE 276: Charlotte?"
LINE 277: "No, but I may suggest it. Probably she thinks Charlotte is in good
LINE 278: hands; she knows that I have not neglected her education. She has
LINE 279: refined, poetical tastes; she can work beautifully in coloured silks;
LINE 280: she can paint flowers, and she can play on the piano very prettily.
LINE 281: These are the accomplishments which we look for in a young gentlewoman;
LINE 282: and----"
LINE 283: "I have none of them!" Joyce exclaimed; not hopelessly, but almost
LINE 284: defiantly: "but, Aunt Lettice, I am not sure that I want them."
LINE 285: "Dear child, I am sure that you _do_ want them," was the reply, with a
LINE 286: smile. "There is a want of 'finish' about you; the more to be
LINE 287: lamented----"
LINE 288: Miss Falconer's speech was interrupted by the appearance of the neat
LINE 289: maid-servant, who laid the cloth, and set out, with the utmost
LINE 290: precision, the glasses and plates and dishes.
LINE 291: "We will adjourn to the sitting-room after dinner," Miss Falconer said.
LINE 292: "I am glad to be spared coming down twice in the day. It was fortunate
LINE 293: that I was seated in this room yesterday when Mrs. More called; she
LINE 294: could not have mounted the stairs. Oh! here is Charlotte. Now we will
LINE 295: sit down to the table; say grace, dear Charlotte."
LINE 296: Charlotte obeyed, and then the cover was lifted from a fowl, done to a
LINE 297: turn; and Patty handed round the vegetables, and poured out cider for
LINE 298: Miss Falconer, while Charlotte had a glass of port-wine, as she had been
LINE 299: rather "below par" for a day or two; and Joyce drank water from
LINE 300: preference.
LINE 301: Before the meal was concluded, Miss Falconer had decided that she would
LINE 302: write to Mrs. More, and propose that her niece from Fair Acres should
LINE 303: accept her invitation to Barley Wood, at such time as might be most
LINE 304: convenient to her to arrange it. She did not tell Joyce of this
LINE 305: decision, but she considered by making it she was conferring a real
LINE 306: favour on the "little rustic," whose beauty she was inwardly comparing
LINE 307: to that of a wild rose; scarcely the drooping rose of Charlotte's poem!
LINE 308: The two girls set out, soon after dinner, for the market-place, where
LINE 309: the shops were situated. The market-place at Wells is not without its
LINE 310: picturesque features; old gabled houses skirt the north side and part of
LINE 311: the south side, while a cross stands at the bottom of the square. Clear
LINE 312: water, from one of the many springs, which first attracted the College
LINE 313: of Priests, in the time of Alfred's son Edward, to found their religious
LINE 314: house in Wells, makes soft music as it runs down the streets in crystal
LINE 315: streams. Two quaint archways, or, as they were in old documents called,
LINE 316: the Palace Eye and the Deanery Eye, stand at the head of the
LINE 317: market-square, and between them are two ancient houses, one of which was
LINE 318: built by Bishop Beckington, and has rooms over the porch, or gateway,
LINE 319: through which foot-passengers pass into the Cathedral Green.
LINE 320: There is a delightful sense that life flows easily and peacefully at
LINE 321: Wells by the appearance of its citizens. The master of the large shop
LINE 322: where the two girls stopped, was standing complacently at the door, his
LINE 323: hands in his pockets, calmly surveying the rush of the cathedral
LINE 324: choristers across the square, for the first chime had sounded for
LINE 325: afternoon service.
LINE 326: Joyce was known as Squire Falconer's daughter at Fair Acres, and treated
LINE 327: with respect. She was conducted to a counter at the end of the dark, low
LINE 328: shop, where the head shopwoman waited on her. Joyce's list of
LINE 329: commissions was for the most part of the homely and useful kind; but
LINE 330: Charlotte was attracted by a display of gauze ribbons, then greatly
LINE 331: in fashion, for the large loops worn on the crown of gipsy bonnets. She
LINE 332: was not proof against buying two yards of straw-coloured ribbon with a
LINE 333: blue edge, and when the ring was pulled down the ends of her purse
LINE 334: again, it slipped off, for there was nothing left in it.
LINE 335: [Illustration: The Market Place, Wells.]
LINE 336: "Look, Joyce, what lovely ribbon! Do get some, Joyce."
LINE 337: But Joyce was intently examining some homely towelling, and weighing the
LINE 338: respective merits of bird's-eye and huckaback.
LINE 339: "I don't want any ribbons," she said. "Yes, it is pretty, but what are
LINE 340: you going to do with it?" Then turning to the counter: "I want a box of
LINE 341: needles--all sizes, and half-a-dozen reels of cotton, and----"
LINE 342: "Joyce, I think I will go to the door while you are finishing all these
LINE 343: dull things; and then----"
LINE 344: Joyce glanced at the large clock over the counter:
LINE 345: "Then, I think, we will go to the service, and if we are not too
LINE 346: late----"
LINE 347: "Oh, yes," Charlotte said, eagerly. "Do let us go, and come back to the
LINE 348: china-shop afterwards."
LINE 349: Charlotte had her own reasons for desiring to go to the cathedral. The
LINE 350: hero of her silent worship was Mr. Bamfylde, a new minor Canon, and it
LINE 351: was his week for doing the duty.
LINE 352: Joyce completed her purchases, and left orders for them to be sent to
LINE 353: the Swan; and then, just as the last chime was ringing and the old clock
LINE 354: struck three, the two girls passed up the nave to the choir.
LINE 355: The work of restoration had not been begun, and the beautiful
LINE 356: proportions of the choir of Wells Cathedral, were disfigured by high
LINE 357: seats and an ugly pulpit. But Joyce's eyes were not critical, and she
LINE 358: gave herself up to the soothing and elevating influence of the place,
LINE 359: without any very distinct idea of why it was soothing and elevating. The
LINE 360: service was slovenly enough in those days, and the new minor Canon got
LINE 361: through it as fast as he could. The choristers straggled in, with no
LINE 362: regard to order, and the lay-vicars conversed freely with each other,
LINE 363: now and then giving the head of the chorister nearest to them a sharp
LINE 364: rap with the corner of an anthem-book, or their own knuckles, through
LINE 365: the open desk. The boys' behaviour was a little better than that of the
LINE 366: men, for they had a wholesome fear of being reported to the Dean and
LINE 367: Chapter, and feeling the weight of the old Grammar School master's
LINE 368: birch-rod.
LINE 369: When the service was half over there was a sound of feet and voice's in
LINE 370: one of the side aisles, and the Dean, who was in his stall, looked
LINE 371: sharply round. The verger hobbled out to see what his coadjutor outside
LINE 372: the choir could be about, to allow such a disturbance. The verger was
LINE 373: sound asleep, with his chin upon his capacious breast, and quite
LINE 374: unconscious of the presence of the two young gentlemen who were chatting
LINE 375: and laughing with each other, in the south transept.
LINE 376: The verger stumped after them, vainly endeavouring to rouse his heavy
LINE 377: friend, and said:
LINE 378: "There's service going on; you mustn't make a disturbance, gentlemen;
LINE 379: it's contrary to the Dean's wishes."
LINE 380: The elder of the two men answered with a laugh, but the younger said:
LINE 381: "Be quiet, Falconer. Don't you hear they are reading prayers?"
LINE 382: "Well, I am neither reading them nor saying them," was the answer. "I
LINE 383: had enough of that at Pembroke. Now, old fellow, keep a civil tongue in
LINE 384: your head, will you?" as the verger, angry at the contemptuous disregard
LINE 385: of his commands, said:
LINE 386: "I'll turn you out, if you don't go peaceably."
LINE 387: Again another laugh; and the fat verger, who had now recovered from his
LINE 388: heavy afternoon nap, came bearing down on the young men.
LINE 389: "You'll walk out this instant," he said, raising his staff of office.
LINE 390: "I wonder you ain't ashamed of yourself."
LINE 391: "No, my good man; on the contrary, I am proud of myself."
LINE 392: "Proud! Yes, a popinjay like you is proud enough, I'll warrant,"
LINE 393: murmured the other verger.
LINE 394: "Can we get into the choir, Arundel?"
LINE 395: "We had better wait here," was the answer. "The service is nearly over.
LINE 396: Come this way into the cloisters. Don't be aggressive, Falconer, and
LINE 397: make a row."
LINE 398: "I hate rows as much as you do," was the answer; "but I am not inclined
LINE 399: to knock under, to this pair of drivelling old idiots."
LINE 400: I cannot say how this unseemly wrangle might have ended had not the
LINE 401: verger in charge of the Dean heard the blowing of the organ pipes, which
LINE 402: was a warning that he was to hasten to perform his office, and conduct
LINE 403: the Dean back to the Deanery.
LINE 404: Almost immediately the organ sounded, and those who had taken part in
LINE 405: the service came out. Joyce and Charlotte were amongst the last of the
LINE 406: very scanty congregation.
LINE 407: Melville, for reasons of his own, did not care to introduce his friend
LINE 408: at that moment, and Mr. Arundel was quite unconscious that the fair face
LINE 409: of which he caught sight, from under the shadow of the large bonnet,
LINE 410: was that of Melville's sister.
LINE 411: "What a sweet face!" he thought; and then, as Joyce turned suddenly
LINE 412: towards the spot by the font where the two gentlemen were standing, a
LINE 413: bright blush and smile, made her look irresistibly lovely.
LINE 414: "Who is that young lady, Melville? She knows you." For Joyce had made a
LINE 415: step forward, and then apparently changed her mind and went towards the
LINE 416: north door with Charlotte.
LINE 417: Melville fingered his cravat, and settled his chin in its place above
LINE 418: it. "That little girl dressed as if she came out of Noah's ark is my
LINE 419: sister! Come, you will have another opportunity of cultivating her
LINE 420: acquaintance, and you want to call at the Palace, don't you?"
LINE 421: "My mother charged me to do so; but there is no haste."
LINE 422: "Oh, you had better not lose time, or you may not find your legs under
LINE 423: the Bishop's mahogany. We live some miles out, you know."
LINE 424: Mr. Arundel turned his head round twice to take a last look at the
LINE 425: retreating figures, and then allowed Melville to tuck his arm in his,
LINE 426: and walk down the cloisters with him to the Palace.
LINE 427: Melville was in fact very anxious to show off his intimacy with Mr.
LINE 428: Arundel to the bishop, for he could not hide from himself the fact that
LINE 429: the ecclesiastical _élite_ of Wells had not paid him the attention he
LINE 430: hoped to receive. The truth was that rumours of Melville's gay and
LINE 431: careless life, and the anxiety he had given his father, had reached the
LINE 432: ears of some in authority. Heads of colleges reported his behaviour at
LINE 433: Oxford, and Melville had been sent down, not for what may be called
LINE 434: serious offences; but still the character hung about him of a man who
LINE 435: cared for nothing earnestly; reading or rowing, it was all alike.
LINE 436: Nothing that Melville did was done with singleness of purpose, except,
LINE 437: as his father sometimes said, with a sigh, "dress himself like a
LINE 438: mountebank and copy London fashions."
