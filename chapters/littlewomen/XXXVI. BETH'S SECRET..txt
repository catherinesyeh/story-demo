LINE 1: When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in
LINE 2: Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too
LINE 3: gradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by
LINE 4: absence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she
LINE 5: saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in
LINE 6: the autumn; yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if
LINE 7: the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining
LINE 8: through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw
LINE 9: and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression
LINE 10: lost much of its power; for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt
LINE 11: that she was better; and, presently, in other cares, Jo for a time
LINE 12: forgot her fear.
LINE 13: But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety
LINE 14: returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven;
LINE 15: but when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth had
LINE 16: thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home.
LINE 17: Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and, as
LINE 18: grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth
LINE 19: down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and
LINE 20: let the fresh sea-breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.
LINE 21: It was not a fashionable place, but, even among the pleasant people
LINE 22: there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.
LINE 23: Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care
LINE 24: for any one else; so they were all in all to each other, and came and
LINE 25: went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about
LINE 26: them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble
LINE 27: one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long
LINE 28: separation was not far away.
LINE 29: They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often between ourselves
LINE 30: and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is
LINE 31: very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart
LINE 32: and Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed
LINE 33: something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She
LINE 34: wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see
LINE 35: what she saw; and, during the quiet weeks, when the shadow grew so plain
LINE 36: to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would
LINE 37: tell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if
LINE 38: her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing
LINE 39: through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks,
LINE 40: with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her,
LINE 41: and the sea made music at her feet.
LINE 42: [Illustration: With her head in Jo's lap, while the wind blew
LINE 43: healthfully over her]
LINE 44: One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still; and,
LINE 45: putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to
LINE 46: see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she could not
LINE 47: find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands
LINE 48: seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been
LINE 49: gathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was
LINE 50: slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened
LINE 51: their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her
LINE 52: eyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking
LINE 53: up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say,--
LINE 54: "Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I
LINE 55: couldn't."
LINE 56: There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even
LINE 57: tears; for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker,
LINE 58: then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about
LINE 59: her, and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.
LINE 60: "I've known it for a good while, dear, and, now I'm used to it, it isn't
LINE 61: hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so, and don't be troubled
LINE 62: about me, because it's best; indeed it is."
LINE 63: "Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel
LINE 64: it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?" asked Jo, refusing
LINE 65: to see or say that it _was_ best, but glad to know that Laurie had no
LINE 66: part in Beth's trouble.
LINE 67: "Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to
LINE 68: think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble any one. But
LINE 69: when I saw you all so well and strong, and full of happy plans, it was
LINE 70: hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,
LINE 71: Jo."
LINE 72: "O Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you! How
LINE 73: could you shut me out, and bear it all alone?"
LINE 74: Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of
LINE 75: the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say
LINE 76: good-by to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.
LINE 77: "Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right; I wasn't sure, no one
LINE 78: said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to
LINE 79: frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and
LINE 80: you so happy with Laurie,--at least, I thought so then."
LINE 81: "And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I
LINE 82: couldn't," cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.
LINE 83: Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,
LINE 84: and added softly,--
LINE 85: "Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor
LINE 86: little heart full of love-lornity all that while."
LINE 87: "Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?" asked Beth, as
LINE 88: innocently as a child. "I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how
LINE 89: can I help it? But he never could be anything to me but my brother. I
LINE 90: hope he truly will be, sometime."
LINE 91: "Not through me," said Jo decidedly. "Amy is left for him, and they
LINE 92: would suit excellently; but I have no heart for such things, now. I
LINE 93: don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You _must_ get well."
LINE 94: "I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel
LINE 95: more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the tide, Jo, when
LINE 96: it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped."
LINE 97: "It _shall_ be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too
LINE 98: young. Beth, I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight against
LINE 99: it. I'll keep you in spite of everything; there must be ways, it can't
LINE 100: be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you from me," cried poor
LINE 101: Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than
LINE 102: Beth's.
LINE 103: Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety; it shows itself
LINE 104: in acts, rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or
LINE 105: protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave
LINE 106: her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death.
LINE 107: Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to
LINE 108: God and nature, Father and mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and
LINE 109: they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and
LINE 110: the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only
LINE 111: loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to
LINE 112: the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,
LINE 113: but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, "I'm
LINE 114: glad to go," for life was very sweet to her; she could only sob out, "I
LINE 115: try to be willing," while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave
LINE 116: of this great sorrow broke over them together.
LINE 117: By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity,--
LINE 118: "You'll tell them this when we go home?"
LINE 119: "I think they will see it without words," sighed Jo; for now it seemed
LINE 120: to her that Beth changed every day.
LINE 121: "Perhaps not; I've heard that the people who love best are often
LINE 122: blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them for
LINE 123: me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them. Meg has
LINE 124: John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by father and
LINE 125: mother, won't you, Jo?"
LINE 126: "If I can; but, Beth, I don't give up yet; I'm going to believe that it
LINE 127: _is_ a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true," said Jo, trying to
LINE 128: speak cheerfully.
LINE 129: Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way,--
LINE 130: "I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try, to any one but
LINE 131: you, because I can't speak out, except to my Jo. I only mean to say
LINE 132: that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm
LINE 133: not like the rest of you; I never made any plans about what I'd do when
LINE 134: I grew up; I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't
LINE 135: seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about
LINE 136: at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and
LINE 137: the hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems
LINE 138: as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven."
LINE 139: Jo could not speak; and for several minutes there was no sound but the
LINE 140: sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew
LINE 141: by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth watched it
LINE 142: till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little
LINE 143: gray-coated sand-bird came tripping over the beach, "peeping" softly to
LINE 144: itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea; it came quite close to Beth,
LINE 145: looked at her with a friendly eye, and sat upon a warm stone, dressing
LINE 146: its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled, and felt comforted, for
LINE 147: the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship, and remind her that
LINE 148: a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.
LINE 149: "Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the
LINE 150: gulls: they are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding
LINE 151: little things. I used to call them my birds, last summer; and mother
LINE 152: said they reminded her of me,--busy, quaker-colored creatures, always
LINE 153: near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of
LINE 154: theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the
LINE 155: wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the
LINE 156: turtle-dove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up
LINE 157: among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear
LINE 158: little girl! she's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender; and
LINE 159: no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall
LINE 160: see her again, but she seems _so_ far away."
LINE 161: "She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to
LINE 162: see and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,"
LINE 163: began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change
LINE 164: was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought
LINE 165: aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.
LINE 166: "Jo, dear, don't hope any more; it won't do any good, I'm sure of that.
LINE 167: We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We'll
LINE 168: have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide will go
LINE 169: out easily, if you help me."
LINE 170: Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face; and with that silent kiss, she
LINE 171: dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.
LINE 172: She was right: there was no need of any words when they got home, for
LINE 173: father and mother saw plainly, now, what they had prayed to be saved
LINE 174: from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed,
LINE 175: saying how glad she was to be at home; and when Jo went down, she found
LINE 176: that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret. Her
LINE 177: father stood leaning his head on the mantel-piece, and did not turn as
LINE 178: she came in; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and
LINE 179: Jo went to comfort her without a word.
