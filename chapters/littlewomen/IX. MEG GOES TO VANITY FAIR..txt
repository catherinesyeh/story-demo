LINE 1: "I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those
LINE 2: children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one April day, as
LINE 3: she stood packing the "go abroady" trunk in her room, surrounded by her
LINE 4: sisters.
LINE 5: "And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole
LINE 6: fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo, looking like a
LINE 7: windmill, as she folded skirts with her long arms.
LINE 8: "And such lovely weather; I'm so glad of that," added Beth, tidily
LINE 9: sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great
LINE 10: occasion.
LINE 11: "I wish I was going to have a fine time, and wear all these nice
LINE 12: things," said Amy, with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically
LINE 13: replenished her sister's cushion.
LINE 14: "I wish you were all going; but, as you can't, I shall keep my
LINE 15: adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can
LINE 16: do, when you have been so kind, lending me things, and helping me get
LINE 17: ready," said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,
LINE 18: which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.
LINE 19: "What did mother give you out of the treasure-box?" asked Amy, who had
LINE 20: not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest, in which Mrs.
LINE 21: March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when
LINE 22: the proper time came.
LINE 23: "A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue
LINE 24: sash. I wanted the violet silk; but there isn't time to make it over, so
LINE 25: I must be contented with my old tarlatan."
LINE 26: "It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it
LINE 27: off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you
LINE 28: might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose
LINE 29: possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.
LINE 30: "There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but
LINE 31: mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,
LINE 32: and Laurie promised to send me all I want," replied Meg. "Now, let me
LINE 33: see; there's my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my
LINE 34: hat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it looks
LINE 35: heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice; oh,
LINE 36: dear!"
LINE 37: "Never mind; you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always
LINE 38: look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding over the little store
LINE 39: of finery in which her soul delighted.
LINE 40: "It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to
LINE 41: do. My blue house-dress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that
LINE 42: I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion,
LINE 43: and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's; I didn't like to say
LINE 44: anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told mother
LINE 45: black, with a white handle, but she forgot, and bought a green one, with
LINE 46: a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain,
LINE 47: but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a
LINE 48: gold top," sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great
LINE 49: disfavor.
LINE 50: "Change it," advised Jo.
LINE 51: "I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much
LINE 52: pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not
LINE 53: going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves
LINE 54: are my comfort. You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich,
LINE 55: and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for
LINE 56: common;" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.
LINE 57: "Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put
LINE 58: some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,
LINE 59: fresh from Hannah's hands.
LINE 60: "No, I wouldn't; for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns, without
LINE 61: any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig," said Jo decidedly.
LINE 62: "I wonder if I shall _ever_ be happy enough to have real lace on my
LINE 63: clothes, and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.
LINE 64: "You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only
LINE 65: go to Annie Moffat's," observed Beth, in her quiet way.
LINE 66: "So I did! Well, I _am_ happy, and I _won't_ fret; but it does seem as
LINE 67: if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There, now, the
LINE 68: trays are ready, and everything in but my ball-dress, which I shall
LINE 69: leave for mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from
LINE 70: the half-filled trunk to the many-times pressed and mended white
LINE 71: tarlatan, which she called her "ball-dress," with an important air.
LINE 72: The next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of
LINE 73: novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather
LINE 74: reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented
LINE 75: than she went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to
LINE 76: take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after
LINE 77: a winter of irksome work, that the mother yielded, and the daughter went
LINE 78: to take her first taste of fashionable life.
LINE 79: The Moffats _were_ very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,
LINE 80: at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its
LINE 81: occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life
LINE 82: they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,
LINE 83: without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or
LINE 84: intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal
LINE 85: the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was
LINE 86: agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best
LINE 87: frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her
LINE 88: exactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of
LINE 89: those about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,
LINE 90: crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well
LINE 91: as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more
LINE 92: she envied her, and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal
LINE 93: as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she
LINE 94: was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves
LINE 95: and silk stockings.
LINE 96: She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls
LINE 97: were busily employed in "having a good time." They shopped, walked,
LINE 98: rode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at
LINE 99: home in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to
LINE 100: entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one
LINE 101: was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.
LINE 102: Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.
LINE 103: Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her
LINE 104: daughter had done. Every one petted her; and "Daisy," as they called
LINE 105: her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.
LINE 106: When the evening for the "small party" came, she found that the poplin
LINE 107: wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,
LINE 108: and making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,
LINE 109: looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new
LINE 110: one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her
LINE 111: cheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.
LINE 112: No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and
LINE 113: Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white
LINE 114: arms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her
LINE 115: heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,
LINE 116: chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter
LINE 117: feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of
LINE 118: flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were
LINE 119: exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.
LINE 120: "It's for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are
LINE 121: altogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a great sniff.
LINE 122: "They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note," put in the
LINE 123: maid, holding it to Meg.
LINE 124: "What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover," cried the
LINE 125: girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.
LINE 126: "The note is from mother, and the flowers from Laurie," said Meg simply,
LINE 127: yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.
LINE 128: "Oh, indeed!" said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note
LINE 129: into her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false
LINE 130: pride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers
LINE 131: cheered her up by their beauty.
LINE 132: Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for
LINE 133: herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the
LINE 134: breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that
LINE 135: Clara, the elder sister, told her she was "the sweetest little thing she
LINE 136: ever saw;" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.
LINE 137: Somehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest
LINE 138: went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed
LINE 139: face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and
LINE 140: fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so _very_
LINE 141: shabby now.
LINE 142: She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her
LINE 143: heart's content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.
LINE 144: Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice;
LINE 145: Major Lincoln asked who "the fresh little girl, with the beautiful
LINE 146: eyes," was; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her, because she
LINE 147: "didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her," as he gracefully expressed
LINE 148: it. So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit
LINE 149: of a conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just
LINE 150: inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,
LINE 151: when she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--
LINE 152: "How old is he?"
LINE 153: "Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.
LINE 154: "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie
LINE 155: says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them."
LINE 156: "Mrs M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,
LINE 157: early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet," said Mrs.
LINE 158: Moffat.
LINE 159: "She told that fib about her mamma, as if she did know, and colored up
LINE 160: when the flowers came, quite prettily. Poor thing! she'd be so nice if
LINE 161: she was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be offended if we
LINE 162: offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?" asked another voice.
LINE 163: "She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is
LINE 164: all she has got. She may tear it to-night, and that will be a good
LINE 165: excuse for offering a decent one."
LINE 166: "We'll see. I shall ask young Laurence, as a compliment to her, and
LINE 167: we'll have fun about it afterward."
LINE 168: [Illustration: Meg's partner appeared]
LINE 169: Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather
LINE 170: agitated. She _was_ proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it
LINE 171: helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had
LINE 172: just heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not
LINE 173: help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it,
LINE 174: but could not, and kept repeating to herself, "Mrs. M. has made her
LINE 175: plans," "that fib about her mamma," and "dowdy tarlatan," till she was
LINE 176: ready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As
LINE 177: that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather
LINE 178: excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she
LINE 179: was making. She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in
LINE 180: her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached
LINE 181: and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish,
LINE 182: yet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed
LINE 183: the peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily
LINE 184: as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly
LINE 185: speeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken
LINE 186: by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others
LINE 187: by herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple
LINE 188: wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter, was weakened by the
LINE 189: unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest
LINE 190: calamities under heaven.
LINE 191: Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half
LINE 192: resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not
LINE 193: speaking out frankly, and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled
LINE 194: that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even
LINE 195: to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends
LINE 196: struck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;
LINE 197: took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with
LINE 198: eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered
LINE 199: her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her
LINE 200: writing, and said, with a sentimental air,--
LINE 201: "Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for
LINE 202: Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a proper compliment
LINE 203: to you."
LINE 204: Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply
LINE 205: demurely,--
LINE 206: "You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come."
LINE 207: "Why not, _chérie_?" asked Miss Belle.
LINE 208: "He's too old."
LINE 209: "My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!" cried Miss
LINE 210: Clara.
LINE 211: "Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches, to hide
LINE 212: the merriment in her eyes.
LINE 213: "You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man," exclaimed Miss
LINE 214: Belle, laughing.
LINE 215: "There isn't any; Laurie is only a little boy," and Meg laughed also at
LINE 216: the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her
LINE 217: supposed lover.
LINE 218: "About your age," Nan said.
LINE 219: "Nearer my sister Jo's; _I_ am seventeen in August," returned Meg,
LINE 220: tossing her head.
LINE 221: "It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said Annie,
LINE 222: looking wise about nothing.
LINE 223: "Yes, he often does, to all of us; for their house is full, and we are
LINE 224: so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,
LINE 225: so it is quite natural that we children should play together;" and Meg
LINE 226: hoped they would say no more.
LINE 227: "It's evident Daisy isn't out yet," said Miss Clara to Belle, with a
LINE 228: nod.
LINE 229: "Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round," returned Miss Belle,
LINE 230: with a shrug.
LINE 231: "I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls; can I do
LINE 232: anything for you, young ladies?" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in, like
LINE 233: an elephant, in silk and lace.
LINE 234: "No, thank you, ma'am," replied Sallie. "I've got my new pink silk for
LINE 235: Thursday, and don't want a thing."
LINE 236: "Nor I,--" began Meg, but stopped, because it occurred to her that she
LINE 237: _did_ want several things, and could not have them.
LINE 238: "What shall you wear?" asked Sallie.
LINE 239: "My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly
LINE 240: torn last night," said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling
LINE 241: very uncomfortable.
LINE 242: "Why don't you send home for another?" said Sallie, who was not an
LINE 243: observing young lady.
LINE 244: "I haven't got any other." It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie
LINE 245: did not see it, and exclaimed, in amiable surprise,--
LINE 246: "Only that? How funny--" She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook
LINE 247: her head at her, and broke in, saying kindly,--
LINE 248: "Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't
LINE 249: out? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen,
LINE 250: for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you
LINE 251: shall wear it, to please me, won't you, dear?"
LINE 252: "You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress, if you don't; it does
LINE 253: well enough for a little girl like me," said Meg.
LINE 254: "Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do
LINE 255: it, and you'd be a regular little beauty, with a touch here and there. I
LINE 256: sha'n't let any one see you till you are done, and then we'll burst upon
LINE 257: them like Cinderella and her godmother, going to the ball," said Belle,
LINE 258: in her persuasive tone.
LINE 259: Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she
LINE 260: would be "a little beauty" after touching up, caused her to accept, and
LINE 261: forget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats.
LINE 262: On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid; and,
LINE 263: between them, they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled
LINE 264: her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,
LINE 265: touched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense
LINE 266: would have added "a _soupçon_ of rouge," if Meg had not rebelled. They
LINE 267: laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly
LINE 268: breathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in
LINE 269: the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,
LINE 270: brooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of
LINE 271: pink silk, which did not show. A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,
LINE 272: and a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white
LINE 273: shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last
LINE 274: wish of her heart. A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a
LINE 275: silver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the
LINE 276: satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.
LINE 277: "Mademoiselle is charmante, très jolie, is she not?" cried Hortense,
LINE 278: clasping her hands in an affected rapture.
LINE 279: "Come and show yourself," said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room
LINE 280: where the others were waiting.
LINE 281: As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings
LINE 282: tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her
LINE 283: "fun" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that
LINE 284: she _was_ "a little beauty." Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase
LINE 285: enthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw
LINE 286: in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered
LINE 287: like a party of magpies.
LINE 288: "While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt,
LINE 289: and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver
LINE 290: butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,
LINE 291: Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands," said
LINE 292: Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.
LINE 293: "I'm afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,"
LINE 294: said Meg to Sallie, as the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the
LINE 295: young ladies to appear at once.
LINE 296: "You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere
LINE 297: beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I
LINE 298: assure you. Let your flowers hang; don't be so careful of them, and be
LINE 299: sure you don't trip," returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was
LINE 300: prettier than herself.
LINE 301: [Illustration: Asked to be introduced]
LINE 302: Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs,
LINE 303: and sailed into the drawing-rooms, where the Moffats and a few early
LINE 304: guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm
LINE 305: about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people, and secures
LINE 306: their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her
LINE 307: before, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen,
LINE 308: who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but
LINE 309: asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable
LINE 310: things to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticised
LINE 311: the rest of the party, inquired who she was, with an air of interest.
LINE 312: She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them,--
LINE 313: "Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,
LINE 314: but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;
LINE 315: sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her."
LINE 316: "Dear me!" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another
LINE 317: observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard, and been
LINE 318: rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.
LINE 319: The "queer feeling" did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting
LINE 320: the new part of fine lady, and so got on pretty well, though the tight
LINE 321: dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and
LINE 322: she was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off, and get lost
LINE 323: or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of
LINE 324: a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped
LINE 325: laughing and looked confused; for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was
LINE 326: staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she
LINE 327: thought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest
LINE 328: eyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her
LINE 329: confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to
LINE 330: Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.
LINE 331: "Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head! I won't care for
LINE 332: it, or let it change me a bit," thought Meg, and rustled across the room
LINE 333: to shake hands with her friend.
LINE 334: "I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't," she said, with her most
LINE 335: grown-up air.
LINE 336: "Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did;" answered
LINE 337: Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her
LINE 338: maternal tone.
LINE 339: "What shall you tell her?" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his
LINE 340: opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him, for the first time.
LINE 341: "I shall say I didn't know you; for you look so grown-up, and unlike
LINE 342: yourself, I'm quite afraid of you," he said, fumbling at his
LINE 343: glove-button.
LINE 344: "How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like
LINE 345: it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?" said Meg, bent on making him say
LINE 346: whether he thought her improved or not.
LINE 347: "Yes, I think she would," returned Laurie gravely.
LINE 348: "Don't you like me so?" asked Meg.
LINE 349: "No, I don't," was the blunt reply.
LINE 350: "Why not?" in an anxious tone.
LINE 351: He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically
LINE 352: trimmed dress, with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,
LINE 353: which had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.
LINE 354: "I don't like fuss and feathers."
LINE 355: That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself; and Meg
LINE 356: walked away, saying petulantly,--
LINE 357: "You are the rudest boy I ever saw."
LINE 358: Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window, to cool
LINE 359: her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant
LINE 360: color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,
LINE 361: she heard him saying to his mother,--
LINE 362: "They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,
LINE 363: but they have spoilt her entirely; she's nothing but a doll, to-night."
LINE 364: "Oh, dear!" sighed Meg; "I wish I'd been sensible, and worn my own
LINE 365: things; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so
LINE 366: uncomfortable and ashamed myself."
LINE 367: She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the
LINE 368: curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one
LINE 369: touched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,
LINE 370: with his very best bow, and his hand out,--
LINE 371: "Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."
LINE 372: "I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you," said Meg, trying to
LINE 373: look offended, and failing entirely.
LINE 374: "Not a bit of it; I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good; I don't like
LINE 375: your gown, but I do think you are--just splendid;" and he waved his
LINE 376: hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.
LINE 377: Meg smiled and relented, and whispered, as they stood waiting to catch
LINE 378: the time,--
LINE 379: "Take care my skirt don't trip you up; it's the plague of my life, and I
LINE 380: was a goose to wear it."
LINE 381: "Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful," said Laurie,
LINE 382: looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.
LINE 383: Away they went, fleetly and gracefully; for, having practised at home,
LINE 384: they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant
LINE 385: sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more
LINE 386: friendly than ever after their small tiff.
LINE 387: "Laurie, I want you to do me a favor; will you?" said Meg, as he stood
LINE 388: fanning her, when her breath gave out, which it did very soon, though
LINE 389: she would not own why.
LINE 390: "Won't I!" said Laurie, with alacrity.
LINE 391: "Please don't tell them at home about my dress to-night. They won't
LINE 392: understand the joke, and it will worry mother."
LINE 393: "Then why did you do it?" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg
LINE 394: hastily added,--
LINE 395: "I shall tell them, myself, all about it, and ''fess' to mother how
LINE 396: silly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself; so you'll not tell, will
LINE 397: you?"
LINE 398: "I give you my word I won't; only what shall I say when they ask me?"
LINE 399: "Just say I looked pretty well, and was having a good time."
LINE 400: "I'll say the first, with all my heart; but how about the other? You
LINE 401: don't look as if you were having a good time; are you?" and Laurie
LINE 402: looked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--
LINE 403: "No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I only wanted a little fun,
LINE 404: but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it."
LINE 405: "Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?" said Laurie, knitting his
LINE 406: black brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a
LINE 407: pleasant addition to the party.
LINE 408: "He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for
LINE 409: them. What a bore!" said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused
LINE 410: Laurie immensely.
LINE 411: He did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking
LINE 412: champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving "like a pair
LINE 413: of fools," as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of
LINE 414: right to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a
LINE 415: defender was needed.
LINE 416: [Illustration: I wouldn't, Meg]
LINE 417: "You'll have a splitting headache to-morrow, if you drink much of that.
LINE 418: I wouldn't Meg; your mother doesn't like it, you know," he whispered,
LINE 419: leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass, and Fisher
LINE 420: stooped to pick up her fan.
LINE 421: "I'm not Meg, to-night; I'm 'a doll,' who does all sorts of crazy
LINE 422: things. To-morrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers,' and be
LINE 423: desperately good again," she answered, with an affected little laugh.
LINE 424: "Wish to-morrow was here, then," muttered Laurie, walking off,
LINE 425: ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.
LINE 426: Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did;
LINE 427: after supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly
LINE 428: upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that
LINE 429: scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no
LINE 430: chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say
LINE 431: good-night.
LINE 432: "Remember!" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had
LINE 433: already begun.
LINE 434: "Silence à la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he
LINE 435: went away.
LINE 436: This little bit of by-play excited Annie's curiosity; but Meg was too
LINE 437: tired for gossip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a
LINE 438: masquerade, and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was
LINE 439: sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her
LINE 440: fortnight's fun, and feeling that she had "sat in the lap of luxury"
LINE 441: long enough.
LINE 442: "It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all
LINE 443: the time. Home _is_ a nice place, though it isn't splendid," said Meg,
LINE 444: looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother
LINE 445: and Jo on the Sunday evening.
LINE 446: "I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem
LINE 447: dull and poor to you, after your fine quarters," replied her mother, who
LINE 448: had given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly eyes are quick
LINE 449: to see any change in children's faces.
LINE 450: Meg had told her adventures gayly, and said over and over what a
LINE 451: charming time she had had; but something still seemed to weigh upon her
LINE 452: spirits, and, when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat
LINE 453: thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little, and looking worried. As
LINE 454: the clock struck nine, and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair,
LINE 455: and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying
LINE 456: bravely,--
LINE 457: "Marmee, I want to ''fess.'"
LINE 458: "I thought so; what is it, dear?"
LINE 459: "Shall I go away?" asked Jo discreetly.
LINE 460: "Of course not; don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to
LINE 461: speak of it before the children, but I want you to know all the dreadful
LINE 462: things I did at the Moffat's."
LINE 463: "We are prepared," said Mrs. March, smiling, but looking a little
LINE 464: anxious.
LINE 465: "I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered
LINE 466: and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie
LINE 467: thought I wasn't proper; I know he did, though he didn't say so, and one
LINE 468: man called me 'a doll.' I knew it was silly, but they flattered me, and
LINE 469: said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a
LINE 470: fool of me."
LINE 471: "Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast
LINE 472: face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame
LINE 473: her little follies.
LINE 474: "No; I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether
LINE 475: abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.
LINE 476: "There is something more, I think;" and Mrs. March smoothed the soft
LINE 477: cheek, which suddenly grew rosy, as Meg answered slowly,--
LINE 478: "Yes; it's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have
LINE 479: people say and think such things about us and Laurie."
LINE 480: Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats;
LINE 481: and, as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill
LINE 482: pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.
LINE 483: "Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried Jo
LINE 484: indignantly. "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so, on the spot?"
LINE 485: "I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help hearing, at
LINE 486: first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I
LINE 487: ought to go away."
LINE 488: "Just wait till _I_ see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle
LINE 489: such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having 'plans,' and being kind to
LINE 490: Laurie, because he's rich, and may marry us by and by! Won't he shout,
LINE 491: when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?" and
LINE 492: Jo laughed, as if, on second thoughts, the thing struck her as a good
LINE 493: joke.
LINE 494: "If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must she,
LINE 495: mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.
LINE 496: "No; never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you
LINE 497: can," said Mrs. March gravely. "I was very unwise to let you go among
LINE 498: people of whom I know so little,--kind, I dare say, but worldly,
LINE 499: ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more
LINE 500: sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,
LINE 501: Meg."
LINE 502: "Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me; I'll forget all the bad, and
LINE 503: remember only the good; for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very
LINE 504: much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, mother;
LINE 505: I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till I'm fit to
LINE 506: take care of myself. But it _is_ nice to be praised and admired, and I
LINE 507: can't help saying I like it," said Meg, looking half ashamed of the
LINE 508: confession.
LINE 509: "That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not
LINE 510: become a passion, and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn
LINE 511: to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the
LINE 512: admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg."
LINE 513: Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind
LINE 514: her, looking both interested and a little perplexed; for it was a new
LINE 515: thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and
LINE 516: things of that sort; and Jo felt as if, during that fortnight, her
LINE 517: sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a
LINE 518: world where she could not follow.
LINE 519: "Mother, do you have 'plans,' as Mrs. Moffat said?" asked Meg bashfully.
LINE 520: "Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ
LINE 521: somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some of them,
LINE 522: for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and
LINE 523: heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but
LINE 524: not too young to understand me; and mothers' lips are the fittest to
LINE 525: speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time,
LINE 526: perhaps, so listen to my 'plans,' and help me carry them out, if they
LINE 527: are good."
LINE 528: Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they
LINE 529: were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,
LINE 530: and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her
LINE 531: serious yet cheery way,--
LINE 532: [Illustration: Holding a hand of each, Mrs. March said, &c.]
LINE 533: "I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be
LINE 534: admired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and
LINE 535: wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care
LINE 536: and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen
LINE 537: by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a
LINE 538: woman; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.
LINE 539: It is natural to think of it, Meg; right to hope and wait for it, and
LINE 540: wise to prepare for it; so that, when the happy time comes, you may
LINE 541: feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I _am_
LINE 542: ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world,--marry
LINE 543: rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which
LINE 544: are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious
LINE 545: thing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to
LINE 546: think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you
LINE 547: poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on
LINE 548: thrones, without self-respect and peace."
LINE 549: "Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put
LINE 550: themselves forward," sighed Meg.
LINE 551: "Then we'll be old maids," said Jo stoutly.
LINE 552: "Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly
LINE 553: girls, running about to find husbands," said Mrs. March decidedly.
LINE 554: "Don't be troubled, Meg; poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of
LINE 555: the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so
LINE 556: love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these
LINE 557: things to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes
LINE 558: of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are
LINE 559: not. One thing remember, my girls: mother is always ready to be your
LINE 560: confidant, father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope that
LINE 561: our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort
LINE 562: of our lives."
LINE 563: "We will, Marmee, we will!" cried both, with all their hearts, as she
LINE 564: bade them good-night.
