LINE 1: As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the
LINE 2: lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.
LINE 3: The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the
LINE 4: little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, "I'd know
LINE 5: which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny;" and so
LINE 6: she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.
LINE 7: Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange-tree in it.
LINE 8: Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying
LINE 9: experiments; this year it was to be a plantation of sun-flowers, the
LINE 10: seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed "Aunt
LINE 11: Cockle-top" and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant
LINE 12: flowers in her garden,--sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,
LINE 13: pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird, and catnip for
LINE 14: the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers,--rather small and earwiggy, but
LINE 15: very pretty to look at,--with honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging
LINE 16: their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it; tall,
LINE 17: white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants
LINE 18: as would consent to blossom there.
LINE 19: Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower-hunts employed the fine
LINE 20: days; and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,--some old, some
LINE 21: new,--all more or less original. One of these was the "P. C."; for, as
LINE 22: secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one;
LINE 23: and, as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the
LINE 24: Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a
LINE 25: year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which
LINE 26: occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in
LINE 27: a row before a table, on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with
LINE 28: a big "P. C." in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper,
LINE 29: called "The Pickwick Portfolio," to which all contributed something;
LINE 30: while Jo, who revelled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven
LINE 31: o'clock, the four members ascended to the club-room, tied their badges
LINE 32: round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as
LINE 33: the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus
LINE 34: Snodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,
LINE 35: who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.
LINE 36: Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original
LINE 37: tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which
LINE 38: they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and
LINE 39: short-comings.
LINE 40: [Illustration: Mr. Pickwick]
LINE 41: On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any
LINE 42: glasses, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr.
LINE 43: Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself
LINE 44: properly, began to read:--
LINE 45: The Pickwick Portfolio.
LINE 46: MAY 20, 18--
LINE 47: Poet's Corner.
LINE 48: ANNIVERSARY ODE.
LINE 49: Again we meet to celebrate
LINE 50: With badge and solemn rite,
LINE 51: Our fifty-second anniversary,
LINE 52: In Pickwick Hall, to-night.
LINE 53: We all are here in perfect health,
LINE 54: None gone from our small band;
LINE 55: Again we see each well-known face,
LINE 56: And press each friendly hand.
LINE 57: Our Pickwick, always at his post,
LINE 58: With reverence we greet,
LINE 59: As, spectacles on nose, he reads
LINE 60: Our well-filled weekly sheet.
LINE 61: Although he suffers from a cold,
LINE 62: We joy to hear him speak,
LINE 63: For words of wisdom from him fall,
LINE 64: In spite of croak or squeak.
LINE 65: Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,
LINE 66: With elephantine grace,
LINE 67: And beams upon the company,
LINE 68: With brown and jovial face.
LINE 69: Poetic fire lights up his eye,
LINE 70: He struggles 'gainst his lot.
LINE 71: Behold ambition on his brow,
LINE 72: And on his nose a blot!
LINE 73: Next our peaceful Tupman comes,
LINE 74: So rosy, plump, and sweet.
LINE 75: Who chokes with laughter at the puns,
LINE 76: And tumbles off his seat.
LINE 77: Prim little Winkle too is here,
LINE 78: With every hair in place,
LINE 79: A model of propriety,
LINE 80: Though he hates to wash his face.
LINE 81: The year is gone, we still unite
LINE 82: To joke and laugh and read,
LINE 83: And tread the path of literature
LINE 84: That doth to glory lead.
LINE 85: Long may our paper prosper well,
LINE 86: Our club unbroken be,
LINE 87: And coming years their blessings pour
LINE 88: On the useful, gay "P. C."
LINE 89: A. SNODGRASS.
LINE 90: THE MASKED MARRIAGE.
LINE 91: A TALE OF VENICE.
LINE 92: Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its
LINE 93: lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the
LINE 94: stately halls of Count de Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and
LINE 95: pages, monks and flower-girls, all mingled gayly in the dance.
LINE 96: Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air; and so with mirth
LINE 97: and music the masquerade went on.
LINE 98: "Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola to-night?" asked a
LINE 99: gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall
LINE 100: upon his arm.
LINE 101: "Yes; is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well
LINE 102: chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she
LINE 103: passionately hates."
LINE 104: "By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a
LINE 105: bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see
LINE 106: how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though
LINE 107: her stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.
LINE 108: "'Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who
LINE 109: haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old count," said the
LINE 110: lady, as they joined the dance.
LINE 111: The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and,
LINE 112: withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet,
LINE 113: he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell upon the gay
LINE 114: throng; and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle
LINE 115: of orange-groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as
LINE 116: Count de Adelon spoke thus:--
LINE 117: "My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered
LINE 118: you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait
LINE 119: your services."
LINE 120: All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a low murmur of
LINE 121: amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom
LINE 122: removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts,
LINE 123: but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over.
LINE 124: Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an
LINE 125: explanation.
LINE 126: "Gladly would I give it if I could; but I only know that it was
LINE 127: the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my
LINE 128: children, let the play end. Unmask, and receive my blessing."
LINE 129: But neither bent the knee; for the young bridegroom replied, in
LINE 130: a tone that startled all listeners, as the mask fell, disclosing
LINE 131: the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover; and,
LINE 132: leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English
LINE 133: earl, was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.
LINE 134: "My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I
LINE 135: could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count
LINE 136: Antonio. I can do more; for even your ambitious soul cannot
LINE 137: refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his
LINE 138: ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand
LINE 139: of this fair lady, now my wife."
LINE 140: The count stood like one changed to stone; and, turning to the
LINE 141: bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph,
LINE 142: "To you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing
LINE 143: may prosper as mine has done; and that you may all win as fair a
LINE 144: bride as I have, by this masked marriage."
LINE 145: S. PICKWICK.

LINE 150: THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH.
LINE 151: Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden,
LINE 152: and after a while it sprouted and became a vine, and bore many
LINE 153: squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one
LINE 154: and took it to market. A grocer-man bought and put it in his
LINE 155: shop. That same morning, a little girl, in a brown hat and blue
LINE 156: dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for
LINE 157: her mother. She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the
LINE 158: big pot; mashed some of it, with salt and butter, for dinner;
LINE 159: and to the rest she added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons
LINE 160: of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers; put it in a deep dish, and
LINE 161: baked it till it was brown and nice; and next day it was eaten
LINE 162: by a family named March.
LINE 163: T. TUPMAN.

LINE 165: MR. PICKWICK, _Sir_:--
LINE 166: I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man
LINE 167: named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and
LINE 168: sometimes won't write his piece in this fine paper I hope you
LINE 169: will pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because
LINE 170: he can't write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do
LINE 171: and no brains in future I will try to take time by the fetlock
LINE 172: and prepare some work which will be all _commy la fo_ that means
LINE 173: all right I am in haste as it is nearly school time
LINE 174: Yours respectably, N. WINKLE.
LINE 175: [The above is a manly and handsome acknowledgment of past
LINE 176: misdemeanors. If our young friend studied punctuation, it would
LINE 177: be well.]
LINE 178: A SAD ACCIDENT.
LINE 179: On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our
LINE 180: basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing, in a body,
LINE 181: to the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate
LINE 182: upon the floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for
LINE 183: domestic purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes; for in
LINE 184: his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a
LINE 185: tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and
LINE 186: torn his garments badly. On being removed from this perilous
LINE 187: situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but
LINE 188: several bruises; and, we are happy to add, is now doing well.
LINE 189: ED.

LINE 193: * *
LINE 194: * It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious *
LINE 195: * disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat *
LINE 196: * Paw. This lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large *
LINE 197: * circle of warm and admiring friends; for her beauty *
LINE 198: * attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues endeared her to *
LINE 199: * all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by the whole *
LINE 200: * community. *
LINE 201: * *
LINE 202: * When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the *
LINE 203: * butcher's cart; and it is feared that some villain, tempted *
LINE 204: * by her charms, basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no *
LINE 205: * trace of her has been discovered; and we relinquish all *
LINE 206: * hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her dish, *
LINE 207: * and weep for her as one lost to us forever. *

LINE 211: A sympathizing friend sends the following gem:--
LINE 212: A LAMENT
LINE 213: FOR S. B. PAT PAW.
LINE 214: We mourn the loss of our little pet,
LINE 215: And sigh o'er her hapless fate,
LINE 216: For never more by the fire she'll sit,
LINE 217: Nor play by the old green gate.
LINE 218: The little grave where her infant sleeps,
LINE 219: Is 'neath the chestnut tree;
LINE 220: But o'er _her_ grave we may not weep,
LINE 221: We know not where it may be.
LINE 222: Her empty bed, her idle ball,
LINE 223: Will never see her more;
LINE 224: No gentle tap, no loving purr
LINE 225: Is heard at the parlor-door.
LINE 226: Another cat comes after her mice,
LINE 227: A cat with a dirty face;
LINE 228: But she does not hunt as our darling did,
LINE 229: Nor play with her airy grace.
LINE 230: Her stealthy paws tread the very hall
LINE 231: Where Snowball used to play,
LINE 232: But she only spits at the dogs our pet
LINE 233: So gallantly drove away.
LINE 234: She is useful and mild, and does her best,
LINE 235: But she is not fair to see;
LINE 236: And we cannot give her your place, dear,
LINE 237: Nor worship her as we worship thee.
LINE 238: A. S.
LINE 239: ADVERTISEMENTS.
LINE 240: MISS ORANTHY BLUGGAGE, the accomplished Strong-Minded Lecturer,

LINE 243: performances.
LINE 244: A WEEKLY MEETING will be held at Kitchen Place, to teach young
LINE 245: ladies how to cook. Hannah Brown will preside; and all are
LINE 246: invited to attend.

LINE 255: American stage. "THE GREEK SLAVE, or Constantine the Avenger,"
LINE 256: is the name of this thrilling drama!!!

LINE 261: must not fret because his dress has not nine tucks.
LINE 262: WEEKLY REPORT.
LINE 263: Meg--Good.
LINE 264: Jo--Bad.
LINE 265: Beth--Very good.
LINE 266: Amy--Middling.
LINE 267: As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to assure
LINE 268: my readers is a _bona fide_ copy of one written by _bona fide_ girls
LINE 269: once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass
LINE 270: rose to make a proposition.
LINE 271: "Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a parliamentary
LINE 272: attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission of a new
LINE 273: member,--one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for
LINE 274: it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary
LINE 275: value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr. Theodore
LINE 276: Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have him."
LINE 277: Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh; but all looked rather
LINE 278: anxious, and no one said a word, as Snodgrass took his seat.
LINE 279: "We'll put it to vote," said the President. "All in favor of this motion
LINE 280: please to manifest it by saying 'Ay.'"
LINE 281: A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a
LINE 282: timid one from Beth.
LINE 283: "Contrary minded say 'No.'"
LINE 284: Meg and Amy were contrary minded; and Mr. Winkle rose to say, with great
LINE 285: elegance, "We don't wish any boys; they only joke and bounce about. This
LINE 286: is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper."
LINE 287: "I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,"
LINE 288: observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she
LINE 289: always did when doubtful.
LINE 290: Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. "Sir, I give you my word as a
LINE 291: gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes to write, and
LINE 292: he'll give a tone to our contributions, and keep us from being
LINE 293: sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so
LINE 294: much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here,
LINE 295: and make him welcome if he comes."
LINE 296: This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,
LINE 297: looking as if he had quite made up his mind.
LINE 298: "Yes, we ought to do it, even if we _are_ afraid. I say he _may_ come,
LINE 299: and his grandpa, too, if he likes."
LINE 300: This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her
LINE 301: seat to shake hands approvingly. "Now then, vote again. Everybody
LINE 302: remember it's our Laurie, and say 'Ay!'" cried Snodgrass excitedly.
LINE 303: "Ay! ay! ay!" replied three voices at once.
LINE 304: "Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by the
LINE 305: _fetlock_,' as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present
LINE 306: the new member;" and, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw
LINE 307: open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag,
LINE 308: flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.
LINE 309: [Illustration: Jo threw open the door of the closet]
LINE 310: "You rogue! you traitor! Jo, how could you?" cried the three girls, as
LINE 311: Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth; and, producing both a chair
LINE 312: and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.
LINE 313: "The coolness of you two rascals is amazing," began Mr. Pickwick, trying
LINE 314: to get up an awful frown, and only succeeding in producing an amiable
LINE 315: smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion; and, rising, with a
LINE 316: grateful salutation to the Chair, said, in the most engaging manner,
LINE 317: "Mr. President and ladies,--I beg pardon, gentlemen,--allow me to
LINE 318: introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club."
LINE 319: "Good! good!" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming-pan
LINE 320: on which she leaned.
LINE 321: "My faithful friend and noble patron," continued Laurie, with a wave of
LINE 322: the hand, "who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for
LINE 323: the base stratagem of to-night. I planned it, and she only gave in after
LINE 324: lots of teasing."
LINE 325: "Come now, don't lay it all on yourself; you know I proposed the
LINE 326: cupboard," broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.
LINE 327: "Never you mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir," said
LINE 328: the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. "But on my
LINE 329: honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth _dewote_ myself to the
LINE 330: interest of this immortal club."
LINE 331: "Hear! hear!" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming-pan like a
LINE 332: cymbal.
LINE 333: "Go on, go on!" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed
LINE 334: benignly.
LINE 335: "I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the
LINE 336: honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between
LINE 337: adjoining nations, I have set up a post-office in the hedge in the lower
LINE 338: corner of the garden; a fine, spacious building, with padlocks on the
LINE 339: doors, and every convenience for the mails,--also the females, if I may
LINE 340: be allowed the expression. It's the old martin-house; but I've stopped
LINE 341: up the door, and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of
LINE 342: things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and
LINE 343: bundles can be passed in there; and, as each nation has a key, it will
LINE 344: be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key; and,
LINE 345: with many thanks for your favor, take my seat."
LINE 346: Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table, and
LINE 347: subsided; the warming-pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time
LINE 348: before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and every
LINE 349: one came out surprising, for every one did her best; so it was an
LINE 350: unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it
LINE 351: broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.
LINE 352: No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,
LINE 353: well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add
LINE 354: "spirit" to the meetings, and "a tone" to the paper; for his orations
LINE 355: convulsed his hearers, and his contributions were excellent, being
LINE 356: patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo
LINE 357: regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare; and remodelled
LINE 358: her own works with good effect, she thought.
LINE 359: The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully,
LINE 360: for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real
LINE 361: office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden-seeds and long
LINE 362: letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings and
LINE 363: puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending
LINE 364: odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams; and his gardener,
LINE 365: who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love-letter to
LINE 366: Jo's care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how
LINE 367: many love-letters that little post-office would hold in the years to
LINE 368: come!
LINE 369: [Illustration: Jo spent the morning on the river]
