LINE 1: Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the
LINE 2: fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of
LINE 3: dusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little
LINE 4: red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender
LINE 5: thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired,
LINE 6: grave, and rather sad; for to-morrow was her birthday, and she was
LINE 7: thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how
LINE 8: little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing
LINE 9: to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show,
LINE 10: and by and by she saw, and was grateful for it.
LINE 11: "An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for
LINE 12: a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a
LINE 13: morsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old, and can't
LINE 14: enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.
LINE 15: Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner; and, I dare say,
LINE 16: old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it; but--" and
LINE 17: there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.
LINE 18: It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to
LINE 19: five-and-twenty; but it's not so bad as it looks, and one can get on
LINE 20: quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon. At
LINE 21: twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly
LINE 22: resolve that they never will be; at thirty they say nothing about it,
LINE 23: but quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by
LINE 24: remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which
LINE 25: they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the
LINE 26: spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are
LINE 27: hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,
LINE 28: and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make
LINE 29: the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters
LINE 30: should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part
LINE 31: of life, if for no other reason; and, looking at them with compassion,
LINE 32: not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may
LINE 33: miss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver
LINE 34: threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by and by,
LINE 35: kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.
LINE 36: Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter
LINE 37: how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that
LINE 38: which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,
LINE 39: and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect
LINE 40: the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and
LINE 41: petted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out
LINE 42: of, the "tips" they have given you from their small store, the stitches
LINE 43: the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet
LINE 44: have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions
LINE 45: that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls
LINE 46: are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them;
LINE 47: and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,
LINE 48: should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and
LINE 49: maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest
LINE 50: corner of her lonely old heart for the "the best nevvy in the world."
LINE 51: Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this
LINE 52: little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before
LINE 53: her,--a substantial, lifelike ghost,--leaning over her, with the very
LINE 54: look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show
LINE 55: it. But, like Jenny in the ballad,--
LINE 56: "She could not think it he,"
LINE 57: and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and
LINE 58: kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully,--
LINE 59: "O my Teddy! O my Teddy!"
LINE 60: "Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"
LINE 61: "Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?"
LINE 62: "Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and
LINE 63: there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."
LINE 64: "Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an
LINE 65: unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.
LINE 66: "Oh, the dickens! now I've done it;" and he looked so guilty that Jo was
LINE 67: down upon him like a flash.
LINE 68: "You've gone and got married!"
LINE 69: "Yes, please, but I never will again;" and he went down upon his knees,
LINE 70: with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,
LINE 71: and triumph.
LINE 72: "Actually married?"
LINE 73: "Very much so, thank you."
LINE 74: "Mercy on us! What dreadful thing will you do next?" and Jo fell into
LINE 75: her seat, with a gasp.
LINE 76: "A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,"
LINE 77: returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with
LINE 78: satisfaction.
LINE 79: "What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like
LINE 80: a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you
LINE 81: ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."
LINE 82: "Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to
LINE 83: barricade."
LINE 84: Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted
LINE 85: the sofa invitingly, as she said, in a cordial tone,--
LINE 86: "The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now; so, come and
LINE 87: 'fess, Teddy."
LINE 88: "How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that
LINE 89: but you;" and Laurie sat down, with an air of great content.
LINE 90: "What does Amy call you?"
LINE 91: "My lord."
LINE 92: "That's like her. Well, you look it;" and Jo's eyes plainly betrayed
LINE 93: that she found her boy comelier than ever.
LINE 94: The pillow was gone, but there _was_ a barricade, nevertheless,--a
LINE 95: natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it,
LINE 96: and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast
LINE 97: a little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie
LINE 98: said, with a vain attempt at dignity,--
LINE 99: "Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"
LINE 100: "Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you
LINE 101: are the same scapegrace as ever."
LINE 102: "Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect," began
LINE 103: Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.
LINE 104: "How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so
LINE 105: irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo, smiling all
LINE 106: over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then
LINE 107: settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.
LINE 108: "It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all
LINE 109: coming up presently. I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you
LINE 110: the grand surprise, and have 'first skim,' as we used to say when we
LINE 111: squabbled about the cream."
LINE 112: "Of course you did, and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end.
LINE 113: Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened; I'm pining to know."
LINE 114: "Well, I did it to please Amy," began Laurie, with a twinkle that made
LINE 115: Jo exclaim,--
LINE 116: "Fib number one; Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if
LINE 117: you can, sir."
LINE 118: "Now she's beginning to marm it; isn't it jolly to hear her?" said
LINE 119: Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite
LINE 120: agreed. "It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to
LINE 121: come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly
LINE 122: changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But
LINE 123: grandpa wanted to come home; he went to please me, and I couldn't let
LINE 124: him go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English
LINE 125: notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come
LINE 126: with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be married,
LINE 127: and then we can do as we like.'"
LINE 128: "Of course you did; you always have things to suit you."
LINE 129: "Not always;" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily,--
LINE 130: "How did you ever get aunt to agree?"
LINE 131: "It was hard work; but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps
LINE 132: of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,
LINE 133: but you all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and it was only
LINE 134: 'taking Time by the fetlock,' as my wife says."
LINE 135: "Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?"
LINE 136: interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with
LINE 137: delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so
LINE 138: tragically gloomy when she saw them last.
LINE 139: "A trifle, perhaps; she's such a captivating little woman I can't help
LINE 140: being proud of her. Well, then, uncle and aunt were there to play
LINE 141: propriety; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use
LINE 142: apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all
LINE 143: round; so we did it."
LINE 144: "When, where, how?" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and
LINE 145: curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.
LINE 146: "Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris; a very quiet
LINE 147: wedding, of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear
LINE 148: little Beth."
LINE 149: Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the
LINE 150: little red pillow, which he remembered well.
LINE 151: "Why didn't you let us know afterward?" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,
LINE 152: when they had sat quite still a minute.
LINE 153: "We wanted to surprise you; we thought we were coming directly home, at
LINE 154: first; but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he
LINE 155: couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our
LINE 156: honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular
LINE 157: honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but
LINE 158: once in their lives. My faith! wasn't it love among the roses!"
LINE 159: Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it; for the
LINE 160: fact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her
LINE 161: that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her
LINE 162: hand; but, as if he guessed the thought that prompted the
LINE 163: half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly
LINE 164: gravity she had never seen in him before,--
LINE 165: "Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever. As
LINE 166: I told you in my letter, when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I
LINE 167: never shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned
LINE 168: to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you change places in my
LINE 169: heart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come
LINE 170: about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never
LINE 171: could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong
LINE 172: and violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it
LINE 173: _was_ one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of
LINE 174: myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that
LINE 175: I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both
LINE 176: alike; but I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything
LINE 177: seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and
LINE 178: I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with
LINE 179: the new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife
LINE 180: Amy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the
LINE 181: happy old times when we first knew one another?"
LINE 182: "I'll believe it, with all my heart; but, Teddy, we never can be boy and
LINE 183: girl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect
LINE 184: it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is
LINE 185: over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this; I see the
LINE 186: change in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I
LINE 187: shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be
LINE 188: what I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we
LINE 189: will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives,
LINE 190: won't we, Laurie?"
LINE 191: He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his
LINE 192: face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish
LINE 193: passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them
LINE 194: both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home
LINE 195: to be a sad one,--
LINE 196: "I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to
LINE 197: set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning
LINE 198: Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how
LINE 199: time does fly!"
LINE 200: "As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like
LINE 201: a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed,' as Peggotty said
LINE 202: of David; and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious
LINE 203: infant," said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.
LINE 204: "You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in
LINE 205: feeling, Teddy. Women always are; and this last year has been such a
LINE 206: hard one that I feel forty."
LINE 207: "Poor Jo! we left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You
LINE 208: _are_ older; here's a line, and there's another; unless you smile, your
LINE 209: eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear
LINE 210: on it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.
LINE 211: What a selfish beast I've been!" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a
LINE 212: remorseful look.
LINE 213: But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone
LINE 214: which she tried to make quite cheerful,--
LINE 215: "No, I had father and mother to help me, the dear babies to comfort me,
LINE 216: and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the
LINE 217: troubles here easier to bear. I _am_ lonely, sometimes, but I dare say
LINE 218: it's good for me, and--"
LINE 219: "You never shall be again," broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,
LINE 220: as if to fence out every human ill. "Amy and I can't get on without
LINE 221: you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go
LINE 222: halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all
LINE 223: be blissfully happy and friendly together."
LINE 224: "If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to
LINE 225: feel quite young already; for, somehow, all my troubles seemed to fly
LINE 226: away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy;" and Jo leaned her
LINE 227: head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill, and
LINE 228: Laurie told her to hold on to him.
LINE 229: He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was
LINE 230: smiling to herself, as if, in truth, her troubles _had_ all vanished at
LINE 231: his coming.
LINE 232: "You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and
LINE 233: laughing the next. You look a little wicked now; what is it, grandma?"
LINE 234: "I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."
LINE 235: "Like angels!"
LINE 236: "Yes, of course, at first; but which rules?"
LINE 237: "I don't mind telling you that she does, now; at least I let her think
LINE 238: so,--it pleases her, you know. By and by we shall take turns, for
LINE 239: marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties."
LINE 240: "You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your
LINE 241: life."
LINE 242: "Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind
LINE 243: much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well; in fact, I
LINE 244: rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and
LINE 245: prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you
LINE 246: a favor all the while."
LINE 247: "That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying
LINE 248: it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.
LINE 249: It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine
LINE 250: scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his "high and mighty"
LINE 251: air,--
LINE 252: "Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of man to submit
LINE 253: to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to
LINE 254: tyrannize or quarrel."
LINE 255: Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy
LINE 256: seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her
LINE 257: pleasure.
LINE 258: "I am sure of that; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is
LINE 259: the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best,
LINE 260: you remember."
LINE 261: "She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie. "Such a
LINE 262: lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than
LINE 263: any of your scoldings,--a regular rouser. I'll tell you all about it
LINE 264: sometime,--_she_ never will, because, after telling me that she despised
LINE 265: and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and
LINE 266: married the good-for-nothing."
LINE 267: "What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend
LINE 268: you."
LINE 269: "I look as if I needed it, don't I?" said Laurie, getting up and
LINE 270: striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the
LINE 271: rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling,--
LINE 272: "Where is she? Where's my dear old Jo?"
LINE 273: In trooped the whole family, and every one was hugged and kissed all
LINE 274: over again, and, after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were
LINE 275: set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty
LINE 276: as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour,
LINE 277: for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned
LINE 278: courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It
LINE 279: was good to see him beam at "my children," as he called the young pair;
LINE 280: it was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection
LINE 281: which completely won his old heart; and best of all, to watch Laurie
LINE 282: revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture
LINE 283: they made.
LINE 284: The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own
LINE 285: dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely
LINE 286: eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that "her ladyship" was altogether
LINE 287: a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair,
LINE 288: "How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the
LINE 289: beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy
LINE 290: old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him." Mrs. March and her
LINE 291: husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw
LINE 292: that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the
LINE 293: better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.
LINE 294: For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful
LINE 295: heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage
LINE 296: was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little
LINE 297: affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more
LINE 298: charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at
LINE 299: once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to
LINE 300: become.
LINE 301: "Love has done much for our little girl," said her mother softly.
LINE 302: "She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear," Mr. March
LINE 303: whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside
LINE 304: him.
LINE 305: Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her "pitty aunty," but
LINE 306: attached herself like a lap-dog to the wonderful châtelaine full of
LINE 307: delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before
LINE 308: he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the
LINE 309: tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement
LINE 310: produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to
LINE 311: have him.
LINE 312: "Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you
LINE 313: hit me in the face: now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman;" and
LINE 314: with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew
LINE 315: in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted
LINE 316: his boyish soul.
LINE 317: [Illustration: The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small
LINE 318: nephew]
LINE 319: "Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot? Ain't it a relishin'
LINE 320: sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks
LINE 321: calling little Amy, Mis. Laurence?" muttered old Hannah, who could not
LINE 322: resist frequent "peeks" through the slide as she set the table in a most
LINE 323: decidedly promiscuous manner.
LINE 324: Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all
LINE 325: burst out together, trying to tell the history of three years in half an
LINE 326: hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and
LINE 327: provide refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they
LINE 328: had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the
LINE 329: little dining-room! Mr. March proudly escorted "Mrs. Laurence;" Mrs.
LINE 330: March as proudly leaned on the arm of "my son;" the old gentleman took
LINE 331: Jo, with a whispered "You must be my girl now," and a glance at the
LINE 332: empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, with trembling
LINE 333: lips, "I'll try to fill her place, sir."
LINE 334: The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for
LINE 335: every one was so busy with the new-comers that they were left to revel
LINE 336: at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the
LINE 337: opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread _ab
LINE 338: libitum_, get a hot biscuit apiece, and, as a crowning trespass, didn't
LINE 339: they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there
LINE 340: to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature
LINE 341: and pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the
LINE 342: sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the
LINE 343: thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little
LINE 344: sinners attached themselves to "Dranpa," who hadn't his spectacles on.
LINE 345: Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on
LINE 346: Father Laurence's arm; the others paired off as before, and this
LINE 347: arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute,
LINE 348: for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry,--
LINE 349: "Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (_coupé_), and use all them lovely
LINE 350: silver dishes that's stored away over yander?"
LINE 351: "Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and
LINE 352: wore diamonds and point-lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good
LINE 353: for her," returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.
LINE 354: "No more there is! Will you have hash or fish-balls for breakfast?"
LINE 355: asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.
LINE 356: "I don't care;" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an
LINE 357: uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party
LINE 358: vanishing above, and, as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last
LINE 359: stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she
LINE 360: looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,
LINE 361: for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was
LINE 362: coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to
LINE 363: herself, "I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed; it won't do to be
LINE 364: dismal now." Then she drew her hand over her eyes,--for one of her
LINE 365: boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was,--and had
LINE 366: just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the
LINE 367: porch-door.
LINE 368: She opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had
LINE 369: come to surprise her; for there stood a tall, bearded gentleman, beaming
LINE 370: on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.
LINE 371: "O Mr. Bhaer, I _am_ so glad to see you!" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if
LINE 372: she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.
LINE 373: [Illustration: O Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you]
LINE 374: "And I to see Miss Marsch,--but no, you haf a party--" and the Professor
LINE 375: paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to
LINE 376: them.
LINE 377: "No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come
LINE 378: home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us."
LINE 379: Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously
LINE 380: away, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the
LINE 381: door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had
LINE 382: something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,
LINE 383: and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary
LINE 384: man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.
LINE 385: "If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You
LINE 386: haf been ill, my friend?"
LINE 387: He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light
LINE 388: fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.
LINE 389: "Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you
LINE 390: last."
LINE 391: "Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that;" and he
LINE 392: shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no
LINE 393: comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,
LINE 394: warm hand.
LINE 395: "Father, mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer," she said, with a
LINE 396: face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as
LINE 397: well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.
LINE 398: If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception, they were set at
LINE 399: rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Every one greeted
LINE 400: him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his
LINE 401: own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all
LINE 402: hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the
LINE 403: more friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those who live
LINE 404: above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer
LINE 405: sat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a
LINE 406: strange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children
LINE 407: went to him like bees to a honey-pot; and, establishing themselves on
LINE 408: each knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling
LINE 409: his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The
LINE 410: women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling
LINE 411: that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his
LINE 412: guest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but
LINE 413: said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.
LINE 414: If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have
LINE 415: amused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like
LINE 416: suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe
LINE 417: the new-comer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.
LINE 418: He got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn
LINE 419: into the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,
LINE 420: and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him
LINE 421: often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own
LINE 422: lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would
LINE 423: turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute
LINE 424: inquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of,
LINE 425: and, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on
LINE 426: the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.
LINE 427: A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water
LINE 428: after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious
LINE 429: omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and
LINE 430: looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and
LINE 431: handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she
LINE 432: usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite
LINE 433: inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the
LINE 434: conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.
LINE 435: Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and
LINE 436: thought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, "How he
LINE 437: would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!"
LINE 438: Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him
LINE 439: look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and
LINE 440: smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting
LINE 441: moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked
LINE 442: it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his
LINE 443: fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that
LINE 444: plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing
LINE 445: escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold
LINE 446: sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!
LINE 447: "Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd
LINE 448: been going a-wooing," said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought,
LINE 449: born of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her
LINE 450: ball, and go down after it to hide her face.
LINE 451: The manœuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for,
LINE 452: though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor
LINE 453: dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the
LINE 454: little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,
LINE 455: saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to
LINE 456: resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.
LINE 457: Nobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted
LINE 458: the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.
LINE 459: Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking
LINE 460: away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal
LINE 461: mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of
LINE 462: bed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of
LINE 463: matches, made a move to go.
LINE 464: "We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together
LINE 465: again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and
LINE 466: pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.
LINE 467: They were not _all_ there. But no one found the words thoughtless or
LINE 468: untrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,
LINE 469: invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the
LINE 470: household league that love made indissoluble. The little chair stood in
LINE 471: its old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished
LINE 472: when the needle grew "so heavy," was still on its accustomed shelf; the
LINE 473: beloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it
LINE 474: Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon
LINE 475: them, seeming to say, "Be happy. I am here."
LINE 476: "Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved," said
LINE 477: Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.
LINE 478: But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,--
LINE 479: "Not to-night, dear. I can't show off to-night."
LINE 480: But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung
LINE 481: Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master
LINE 482: could not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter
LINE 483: power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very
LINE 484: still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's
LINE 485: favorite hymn. It was hard to say,--
LINE 486: "Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;"
LINE 487: and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that
LINE 488: her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.
LINE 489: "Now, we must finish with Mignon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings that," said
LINE 490: Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with
LINE 491: a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood,
LINE 492: saying,--
LINE 493: "You will sing with me? We go excellently well together."
LINE 494: A pleasing fiction, by the way; for Jo had no more idea of music than a
LINE 495: grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a
LINE 496: whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.
LINE 497: It didn't much matter; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily
LINE 498: and well; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen
LINE 499: to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.
LINE 500: [Illustration: Mr. Bhaer sang heartily]
LINE 501: "Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,"
LINE 502: used to be the Professor's favorite line, for "das land" meant Germany
LINE 503: to him; but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,
LINE 504: upon the words,--
LINE 505: "There, oh there, might I with thee,
LINE 506: O my beloved, go!"
LINE 507: and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she
LINE 508: longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither
LINE 509: whenever he liked.
LINE 510: The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered
LINE 511: with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners
LINE 512: entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been
LINE 513: introduced simply as "my sister," and no one had called her by her new
LINE 514: name since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in
LINE 515: his most gracious manner, at parting,--
LINE 516: "My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that
LINE 517: there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."
LINE 518: Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly
LINE 519: illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most
LINE 520: delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.
LINE 521: "I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me
LINE 522: leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here
LINE 523: some days."
LINE 524: He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave
LINE 525: as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes; for Mrs. March was not
LINE 526: so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.
LINE 527: "I suspect that is a wise man," remarked Mr. March, with placid
LINE 528: satisfaction, from the hearth-rug, after the last guest had gone.
LINE 529: "I know he is a good one," added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as
LINE 530: she wound up the clock.
LINE 531: "I thought you'd like him," was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her
LINE 532: bed.
LINE 533: She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,
LINE 534: and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,
LINE 535: somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen
LINE 536: his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a
LINE 537: severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to
LINE 538: be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the
LINE 539: subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture
LINE 540: in the dark.
