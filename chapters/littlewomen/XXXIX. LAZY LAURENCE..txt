LINE 1: Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He
LINE 2: was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed
LINE 3: to give a home-like charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a
LINE 4: part. He rather missed the "petting" he used to receive, and enjoyed a
LINE 5: taste of it again; for no attentions, however flattering, from
LINE 6: strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls
LINE 7: at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad
LINE 8: to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the
LINE 9: representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she
LINE 10: would confess. They naturally took comfort in each other's society, and
LINE 11: were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for, at Nice,
LINE 12: no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while
LINE 13: apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were
LINE 14: half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each
LINE 15: other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sunk in
LINE 16: hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to
LINE 17: please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he
LINE 18: gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women
LINE 19: know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any
LINE 20: kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible,
LINE 21: trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word
LINE 22: because one had been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous,
LINE 23: and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have
LINE 24: taken them; but, at the same time, he felt that he could not change the
LINE 25: opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes
LINE 26: that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful
LINE 27: surprise.
LINE 28: "All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day; I preferred to stay at
LINE 29: home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to
LINE 30: sketch; will you come?" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day
LINE 31: when he lounged in as usual, about noon.
LINE 32: "Well, yes; but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?" he answered
LINE 33: slowly, for the shaded _salon_ looked inviting, after the glare without.
LINE 34: "I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so
LINE 35: you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves
LINE 36: nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,
LINE 37: which were a weak point with Laurie.
LINE 38: "Then I'll go with pleasure;" and he put out his hand for her
LINE 39: sketch-book. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp--
LINE 40: "Don't trouble yourself; it's no exertion to me, but _you_ don't look
LINE 41: equal to it."
LINE 42: Laurie lifted his eyebrows, and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran
LINE 43: downstairs; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins
LINE 44: himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and
LINE 45: fall asleep on his perch.
LINE 46: The two never quarrelled,--Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie
LINE 47: was too lazy; so, in a minute he peeped under her hat-brim with an
LINE 48: inquiring air; she answered with a smile, and they went on together in
LINE 49: the most amicable manner.
LINE 50: It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque
LINE 51: scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,
LINE 52: whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a
LINE 53: bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket
LINE 54: over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone, while his goats skipped among
LINE 55: the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with
LINE 56: panniers of freshly-cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a
LINE 57: _capaline_ sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning
LINE 58: with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the
LINE 59: quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on
LINE 60: the bough. Gnarled olive-trees covered the hills with their dusky
LINE 61: foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones
LINE 62: fringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the
LINE 63: Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.
LINE 64: Valrosa well deserved its name, for, in that climate of perpetual
LINE 65: summer, roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust
LINE 66: themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to
LINE 67: passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon-trees and
LINE 68: feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where
LINE 69: seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom; every cool
LINE 70: grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every
LINE 71: fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to
LINE 72: smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped
LINE 73: the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of
LINE 74: the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and
LINE 75: the white-walled city on its shore.
LINE 76: "This is a regular honeymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such
LINE 77: roses?" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a
LINE 78: luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.
LINE 79: "No, nor felt such thorns," returned Laurie, with his thumb in his
LINE 80: mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that
LINE 81: grew just beyond his reach.
LINE 82: "Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns," said Amy,
LINE 83: gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall
LINE 84: behind her. She put them in his button-hole, as a peace-offering, and he
LINE 85: stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in
LINE 86: the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and
LINE 87: he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,
LINE 88: when imaginative young men find significance in trifles, and food for
LINE 89: romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny
LINE 90: red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like
LINE 91: that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the
LINE 92: sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and,
LINE 93: for a moment, he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the
LINE 94: next instant his American common-sense got the better of sentimentality,
LINE 95: and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.
LINE 96: "It's good advice; you'd better take it and save your fingers," she
LINE 97: said, thinking her speech amused him.
LINE 98: "Thank you, I will," he answered in jest, and a few months later he did
LINE 99: it in earnest.
LINE 100: "Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?" she asked presently,
LINE 101: as she settled herself on a rustic seat.
LINE 102: "Very soon."
LINE 103: "You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks."
LINE 104: "I dare say; short answers save trouble."
LINE 105: "He expects you, and you really ought to go."
LINE 106: "Hospitable creature! I know it."
LINE 107: "Then why don't you do it?"
LINE 108: "Natural depravity, I suppose."
LINE 109: "Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!" and Amy looked
LINE 110: severe.
LINE 111: "Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I
LINE 112: might as well stay, and plague you a little longer, you can bear it
LINE 113: better; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently;" and Laurie
LINE 114: composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.
LINE 115: Amy shook her head, and opened her sketch-book with an air of
LINE 116: resignation; but she had made up her mind to lecture "that boy," and in
LINE 117: a minute she began again.
LINE 118: "What are you doing just now?"
LINE 119: "Watching lizards."
LINE 120: "No, no; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"
LINE 121: "Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."
LINE 122: "How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars, and I will only allow
LINE 123: it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch; I need a
LINE 124: figure."
LINE 125: "With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me,--full-length or
LINE 126: three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a
LINE 127: recumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it '_Dolce far
LINE 128: niente._'"
LINE 129: "Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. _I_ intend to work hard,"
LINE 130: said Amy, in her most energetic tone.
LINE 131: "What delightful enthusiasm!" and he leaned against a tall urn with an
LINE 132: air of entire satisfaction.
LINE 133: "What would Jo say if she saw you now?" asked Amy impatiently, hoping to
LINE 134: stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.
LINE 135: "As usual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'" He laughed as he spoke, but the
LINE 136: laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the
LINE 137: utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed
LINE 138: yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them
LINE 139: before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on
LINE 140: Laurie's face,--a hard, bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and
LINE 141: regret. It was gone before she could study it, and the listless
LINE 142: expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic
LINE 143: pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in
LINE 144: the sun with uncovered head, and eyes full of southern dreaminess; for
LINE 145: he seemed to have forgotten her, and fallen into a reverie.
LINE 146: "You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb," she
LINE 147: said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark
LINE 148: stone.
LINE 149: "Wish I was!"
LINE 150: "That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoilt your life. You are so
LINE 151: changed, I sometimes think--" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,
LINE 152: half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.
LINE 153: Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated
LINE 154: to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to
LINE 155: say it to her mother,--
LINE 156: "It's all right, ma'am."
LINE 157: That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry
LINE 158: her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the
LINE 159: cordial tone in which she said,--
LINE 160: "I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I
LINE 161: fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost
LINE 162: your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some
LINE 163: of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a
LINE 164: foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun; come and lie on the grass
LINE 165: here, and 'let us be friendly,' as Jo used to say when we got in the
LINE 166: sofa-corner and told secrets."
LINE 167: [Illustration: Laurie threw himself down on the turf]
LINE 168: Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse
LINE 169: himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay
LINE 170: there.
LINE 171: "I'm all ready for the secrets;" and he glanced up with a decided
LINE 172: expression of interest in his eyes.
LINE 173: "I've none to tell; you may begin."
LINE 174: "Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news
LINE 175: from home."
LINE 176: "You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I
LINE 177: fancied Jo would send you volumes."
LINE 178: "She's very busy; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,
LINE 179: you know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?" he
LINE 180: asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he
LINE 181: had been wondering if Amy knew his secret, and wanted to talk about it.
LINE 182: "Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air. "Rome took all
LINE 183: the vanity out of me; for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too
LINE 184: insignificant to live, and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair."
LINE 185: "Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"
LINE 186: "That's just why,--because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy
LINE 187: can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a
LINE 188: common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."
LINE 189: "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?"
LINE 190: "Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the
LINE 191: chance."
LINE 192: It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes
LINE 193: young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled,
LINE 194: but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a
LINE 195: long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.
LINE 196: "Good! and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."
LINE 197: Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her
LINE 198: downcast face, that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,--
LINE 199: "Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?"
LINE 200: "I don't promise to answer."
LINE 201: "Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world
LINE 202: enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and
LINE 203: you last year, and it's my private opinion that, if he had not been
LINE 204: called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come
LINE 205: of it--hey?"
LINE 206: "That's not for me to say," was Amy's prim reply; but her lips would
LINE 207: smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye, which betrayed
LINE 208: that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.
LINE 209: "You are not engaged, I hope?" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly
LINE 210: and grave all of a sudden.
LINE 211: "No."
LINE 212: "But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his
LINE 213: knees, won't you?"
LINE 214: "Very likely."
LINE 215: "Then you are fond of old Fred?"
LINE 216: "I could be, if I tried."
LINE 217: "But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what
LINE 218: unearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied
LINE 219: you'd like."
LINE 220: "He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners," began Amy, trying
LINE 221: to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself,
LINE 222: in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.
LINE 223: "I understand; queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean
LINE 224: to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as
LINE 225: the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's
LINE 226: girls."
LINE 227: "True, nevertheless."
LINE 228: A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered
LINE 229: contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this
LINE 230: instinctively, and laid himself down again, with a sense of
LINE 231: disappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well
LINE 232: as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve
LINE 233: to deliver her lecture without delay.
LINE 234: "I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little," she said
LINE 235: sharply.
LINE 236: "Do it for me, there's a dear girl."
LINE 237: "I could, if I tried;" and she looked as if she would like doing it in
LINE 238: the most summary style.
LINE 239: "Try, then; I give you leave," returned Laurie, who enjoyed having some
LINE 240: one to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.
LINE 241: "You'd be angry in five minutes."
LINE 242: "I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire: you are
LINE 243: as cool and soft as snow."
LINE 244: "You don't know what I can do; snow produces a glow and a tingle, if
LINE 245: applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good
LINE 246: stirring up would prove it."
LINE 247: "Stir away; it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said
LINE 248: when his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a
LINE 249: carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees
LINE 250: with you."
LINE 251: Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the
LINE 252: apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and
LINE 253: began:--
LINE 254: "Flo and I have got a new name for you; it's 'Lazy Laurence.' How do you
LINE 255: like it?"
LINE 256: She thought it would annoy him; but he only folded his arms under his
LINE 257: head, with an imperturbable "That's not bad. Thank you, ladies."
LINE 258: "Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?"
LINE 259: "Pining to be told."
LINE 260: "Well, I despise you."
LINE 261: If she had even said "I hate you," in a petulant or coquettish tone, he
LINE 262: would have laughed, and rather liked it; but the grave, almost sad,
LINE 263: accent of her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly,--
LINE 264: "Why, if you please?"
LINE 265: "Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are
LINE 266: faulty, lazy, and miserable."
LINE 267: "Strong language, mademoiselle."
LINE 268: "If you like it, I'll go on."
LINE 269: "Pray, do; it's quite interesting."
LINE 270: "I thought you'd find it so; selfish people always like to talk about
LINE 271: themselves."
LINE 272: "Am _I_ selfish?" The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone
LINE 273: of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was
LINE 274: generosity.
LINE 275: "Yes, very selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as
LINE 276: effective, just then, as an angry one. "I'll show you how, for I've
LINE 277: studied you while we have been frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied
LINE 278: with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing
LINE 279: but waste time and money and disappoint your friends."
LINE 280: "Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-years grind?"
LINE 281: "You don't look as if you'd had much; at any rate, you are none the
LINE 282: better for it, as far as I can see. I said, when we first met, that you
LINE 283: had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so nice
LINE 284: as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy; you like
LINE 285: gossip, and waste time on frivolous things; you are contented to be
LINE 286: petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected
LINE 287: by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty,--ah, you
LINE 288: like that, Old Vanity! but it's the truth, so I can't help saying
LINE 289: it,--with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find
LINE 290: nothing to do but dawdle; and, instead of being the man you might and
LINE 291: ought to be, you are only--" There she stopped, with a look that had
LINE 292: both pain and pity in it.
LINE 293: "Saint Laurence on a gridiron," added Laurie, blandly finishing the
LINE 294: sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a
LINE 295: wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now, and a half-angry, half-injured
LINE 296: expression replaced the former indifference.
LINE 297: "I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we
LINE 298: can make you what we will; but the instant we honestly try to do you
LINE 299: good, you laugh at us, and won't listen, which proves how much your
LINE 300: flattery is worth." Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the
LINE 301: exasperating martyr at her feet.
LINE 302: In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,
LINE 303: and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child,--
LINE 304: "I will be good, oh, I will be good!"
LINE 305: But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest; and, tapping on the
LINE 306: outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly,--
LINE 307: "Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a
LINE 308: woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best
LINE 309: gloves, and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven!
LINE 310: so I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal-rings on it, only
LINE 311: the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was
LINE 312: here to help me!"
LINE 313: "So do I!"
LINE 314: The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in
LINE 315: the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a
LINE 316: new thought in her mind; but he was lying with his hat half over his
LINE 317: face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his
LINE 318: chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and
LINE 319: the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide
LINE 320: something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute
LINE 321: various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind,
LINE 322: and told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered
LINE 323: that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo; she recalled the shadow on
LINE 324: his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the
LINE 325: little old ring, which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are
LINE 326: quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that
LINE 327: perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she
LINE 328: was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and, when she spoke again, it was
LINE 329: in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to
LINE 330: make it so.
LINE 331: "I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie; and if you weren't
LINE 332: the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.
LINE 333: But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they
LINE 334: should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps,
LINE 335: they would understand the change better than I do."
LINE 336: "I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as
LINE 337: touching as a broken one.
LINE 338: "They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,
LINE 339: when I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did
LINE 340: like that Miss Randal, and now I hate her!" said artful Amy, wishing to
LINE 341: be sure of her facts this time.
LINE 342: "Hang Miss Randal!" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look
LINE 343: that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.
LINE 344: "I beg pardon; I thought--" and there she paused diplomatically.
LINE 345: "No, you didn't; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but
LINE 346: Jo." Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face
LINE 347: away as he spoke.
LINE 348: "I did think so; but as they never said anything about it, and you came
LINE 349: away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I
LINE 350: was sure she loved you dearly."
LINE 351: "She _was_ kind, but not in the right way; and it's lucky for her she
LINE 352: didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's
LINE 353: her fault, though, and you may tell her so."
LINE 354: The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled
LINE 355: Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.
LINE 356: "I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I can't
LINE 357: help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."
LINE 358: "Don't, that's her name for me!" and Laurie put up his hand with a quick
LINE 359: gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, half-reproachful
LINE 360: tone. "Wait till you've tried it yourself," he added, in a low voice, as
LINE 361: he pulled up the grass by the handful.
LINE 362: "I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved," said
LINE 363: Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.
LINE 364: Now, Laurie flattered himself that he _had_ borne it remarkably well,
LINE 365: making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live
LINE 366: it down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the
LINE 367: first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first
LINE 368: failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if
LINE 369: suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream, and found it impossible to go to
LINE 370: sleep again. Presently he sat up, and asked slowly,--
LINE 371: "Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?"
LINE 372: "Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you do
LINE 373: something splendid, and _make_ her love you?"
LINE 374: "I did my best, but it was no use."
LINE 375: "Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have
LINE 376: done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail
LINE 377: after spending so much time and money, when every one knew you _could_
LINE 378: do well."
LINE 379: "I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me," began Laurie,
LINE 380: leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.
LINE 381: "No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and
LINE 382: proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set about
LINE 383: another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self again,
LINE 384: and forget your trouble."
LINE 385: "That's impossible."
LINE 386: "Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much she
LINE 387: knows about such things.' I don't pretend to be wise, but I _am_
LINE 388: observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm
LINE 389: interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies; and,
LINE 390: though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love
LINE 391: Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's
LINE 392: wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one
LINE 393: you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake up and
LINE 394: be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."
LINE 395: Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on
LINE 396: his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had
LINE 397: been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,
LINE 398: merely saying,--
LINE 399: "How do you like that?"
LINE 400: He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it
LINE 401: was capitally done,--the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless
LINE 402: face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the
LINE 403: little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.
LINE 404: "How well you draw!" he said, with genuine surprise and pleasure at her
LINE 405: skill, adding, with a half-laugh,--
LINE 406: "Yes, that's me."
LINE 407: "As you are: this is as you were;" and Amy laid another sketch beside
LINE 408: the one he held.
LINE 409: It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it
LINE 410: which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a
LINE 411: sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough
LINE 412: sketch of Laurie taming a horse; hat and coat were off, and every line
LINE 413: of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude, was full
LINE 414: of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching
LINE 415: his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing
LINE 416: the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had
LINE 417: mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect
LINE 418: attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of
LINE 419: strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy, that contrasted sharply with
LINE 420: the supine grace of the "_Dolce far niente_" sketch. Laurie said
LINE 421: nothing; but, as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush
LINE 422: up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little
LINE 423: lesson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without waiting for
LINE 424: him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way,--
LINE 425: [Illustration: A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse]
LINE 426: "Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all
LINE 427: looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and
LINE 428: I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the
LINE 429: other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you."
LINE 430: "Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate
LINE 431: you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon Paradise' that five
LINE 432: o'clock is the dinner-hour at your hotel?"
LINE 433: Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow,
LINE 434: and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures
LINE 435: should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,
LINE 436: but it _was_ an affectation now, for the rousing had been more
LINE 437: efficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his
LINE 438: manner, and said to herself,--
LINE 439: "Now I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad; if it makes
LINE 440: him hate me, I'm sorry; but it's true, and I can't take back a word of
LINE 441: it."
LINE 442: They laughed and chatted all the way home; and little Baptiste, up
LINE 443: behind, thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits.
LINE 444: But both felt ill at ease; the friendly frankness was disturbed, the
LINE 445: sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gayety, there
LINE 446: was a secret discontent in the heart of each.
LINE 447: "Shall we see you this evening, _mon frère_?" asked Amy as they parted
LINE 448: at her aunt's door.
LINE 449: "Unfortunately I have an engagement. _Au revoir, mademoiselle_," and
LINE 450: Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became
LINE 451: him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and
LINE 452: warmly,--
LINE 453: "No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd
LINE 454: rather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental
LINE 455: salutations in France."
LINE 456: "Good-by, dear," and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,
LINE 457: Laurie left her, after a hand-shake almost painful in its heartiness.
LINE 458: Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made
LINE 459: her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:--
LINE 460: "MY DEAR MENTOR,--
LINE 461: "Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself,
LINE 462: for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of
LINE 463: boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a
LINE 464: blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited
LINE 465: by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.
LINE 466: "Yours gratefully, TELEMACHUS."
LINE 467: "Good boy! I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving smile; the
LINE 468: next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,
LINE 469: with an involuntary sigh,--
LINE 470: "Yes, I _am_ glad, but how I shall miss him!"
