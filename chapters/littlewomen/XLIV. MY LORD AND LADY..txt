LINE 1: "Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The
LINE 2: luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery, trying
LINE 3: to find some things I want," said Laurie, coming in the next day to find
LINE 4: Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made "the baby"
LINE 5: again.
LINE 6: "Certainly. Go, dear; I forget that you have any home but this," and
LINE 7: Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding-ring, as if
LINE 8: asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.
LINE 9: "I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it; but I can't get
LINE 10: on without my little woman any more than a--"
LINE 11: "Weathercock can without wind," suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile;
LINE 12: Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.
LINE 13: "Exactly; for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only
LINE 14: an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an easterly
LINE 15: spell since I was married; don't know anything about the north, but am
LINE 16: altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?"
LINE 17: "Lovely weather so far; I don't know how long it will last, but I'm not
LINE 18: afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear,
LINE 19: and I'll find your bootjack; I suppose that's what you are rummaging
LINE 20: after among my things. Men are _so_ helpless, mother," said Amy, with a
LINE 21: matronly air, which delighted her husband.
LINE 22: "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?" asked
LINE 23: Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.
LINE 24: "We have our plans; we don't mean to say much about them yet, because we
LINE 25: are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into
LINE 26: business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to
LINE 27: him that I'm not spoilt. I need something of the sort to keep me steady.
LINE 28: I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man."
LINE 29: "And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at
LINE 30: Laurie's decision, and the energy with which he spoke.
LINE 31: "After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall
LINE 32: astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant
LINE 33: society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall
LINE 34: exert over the world at large. That's about it, isn't it, Madame
LINE 35: RÃ©camier?" asked Laurie, with a quizzical look at Amy.
LINE 36: "Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by
LINE 37: calling me names before their faces," answered Amy, resolving that there
LINE 38: should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a _salon_ as a
LINE 39: queen of society.
LINE 40: "How happy those children seem together!" observed Mr. March, finding it
LINE 41: difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had
LINE 42: gone.
LINE 43: "Yes, and I think it will last," added Mrs. March, with the restful
LINE 44: expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.
LINE 45: "I know it will. Happy Amy!" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as
LINE 46: Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.
LINE 47: Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the
LINE 48: bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, who was flitting about,
LINE 49: arranging her new art treasures,--
LINE 50: "Mrs. Laurence."
LINE 51: "My lord!"
LINE 52: "That man intends to marry our Jo!"
LINE 53: "I hope so; don't you, dear?"
LINE 54: "Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that
LINE 55: expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal
LINE 56: richer."
LINE 57: "Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love
LINE 58: one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.
LINE 59: Women _never_ should marry for money--" Amy caught herself up short as
LINE 60: the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with
LINE 61: malicious gravity,--
LINE 62: "Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend
LINE 63: to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your
LINE 64: duty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a
LINE 65: good-for-nothing like me."
LINE 66: "O my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I
LINE 67: said 'Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes
LINE 68: wish you _were_ poor that I might show how much I love you;" and Amy,
LINE 69: who was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave
LINE 70: convincing proofs of the truth of her words.
LINE 71: "You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be
LINE 72: once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd
LINE 73: gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your
LINE 74: living by rowing on the lake."
LINE 75: "Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a
LINE 76: richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I
LINE 77: have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to
LINE 78: think it is their only salvation; but you had better lessons, and,
LINE 79: though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the
LINE 80: daughter was true to the mother's teaching. I told mamma so yesterday,
LINE 81: and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a
LINE 82: million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral
LINE 83: remarks, Mrs. Laurence;" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an absent
LINE 84: look, though fixed upon his face.
LINE 85: "Yes, I am, and admiring the dimple in your chin at the same time. I
LINE 86: don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my
LINE 87: handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is
LINE 88: _such_ a comfort to me;" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature
LINE 89: with artistic satisfaction.
LINE 90: Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that
LINE 91: suited him better, as he plainly showed, though he did laugh at his
LINE 92: wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly,--
LINE 93: "May I ask you a question, dear?"
LINE 94: "Of course you may."
LINE 95: "Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"
LINE 96: "Oh, that's the trouble, is it? I thought there was something in the
LINE 97: dimple that didn't suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the
LINE 98: happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding with a
LINE 99: heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?"
LINE 100: Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied; her last little jealous fear
LINE 101: vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and
LINE 102: confidence.
LINE 103: "I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't
LINE 104: we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in
LINE 105: Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said Laurie, when they
LINE 106: began to pace up and down the long drawing-room, arm-in-arm, as they
LINE 107: were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.
LINE 108: [Illustration: They began to pace up and down]
LINE 109: "Jo would find us out, and spoil it all; she is very proud of him, just
LINE 110: as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful
LINE 111: thing."
LINE 112: "Bless her dear heart! she won't think so when she has a literary
LINE 113: husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We
LINE 114: won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in
LINE 115: spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she
LINE 116: believes in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her in
LINE 117: that way."
LINE 118: "How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was
LINE 119: always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely; and, thanks
LINE 120: to you, the dream has come true."
LINE 121: "Ah! we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of poverty
LINE 122: that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of,
LINE 123: but poor gentlefolks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people
LINE 124: don't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping
LINE 125: them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not
LINE 126: offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a
LINE 127: blarneying beggar; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it is
LINE 128: harder."
LINE 129: "Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other member of the
LINE 130: domestic admiration society.
LINE 131: "Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I was
LINE 132: going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many
LINE 133: talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real
LINE 134: hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some
LINE 135: of them, working like heroes, poor and friendless, but so full of
LINE 136: courage, patience, and ambition, that I was ashamed of myself, and
LINE 137: longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it's a
LINE 138: satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be
LINE 139: allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of
LINE 140: fuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven't, it's a pleasure to
LINE 141: comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it
LINE 142: out."
LINE 143: "Yes, indeed; and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer in
LINE 144: silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a
LINE 145: princess of me, as the king does the beggar-maid in the old story.
LINE 146: Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth,
LINE 147: health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help
LINE 148: at the right minute. People have been very kind to me; and whenever I
LINE 149: see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand
LINE 150: and help them, as I was helped."
LINE 151: "And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie, resolving,
LINE 152: with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for
LINE 153: the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. "Rich
LINE 154: people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their
LINE 155: money accumulate for others to waste. It's not half so sensible to leave
LINE 156: legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and
LINE 157: enjoy making one's fellow-creatures happy with it. We'll have a good
LINE 158: time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving
LINE 159: other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about
LINE 160: emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?"
LINE 161: "With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping, as you
LINE 162: ride gallantly through the world, to share your cloak with the beggar."
LINE 163: "It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"
LINE 164: So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,
LINE 165: feeling that their pleasant home was more home-like because they hoped
LINE 166: to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more
LINE 167: uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough
LINE 168: ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely
LINE 169: knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest
LINE 170: than they.
