LINE 1: Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No
LINE 2: stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much
LINE 3: disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because
LINE 4: it was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's
LINE 5: promise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little
LINE 6: crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful
LINE 7: old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true
LINE 8: guide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a
LINE 9: "Merry Christmas," and bade her see what was under her pillow. A
LINE 10: green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few
LINE 11: words written by their mother, which made their one present very
LINE 12: precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find
LINE 13: their little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat
LINE 14: looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the
LINE 15: coming day.
LINE 16: In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,
LINE 17: which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her
LINE 18: very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.
LINE 19: "Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to
LINE 20: the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, "mother wants us to
LINE 21: read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used
LINE 22: to be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war
LINE 23: trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you
LINE 24: please; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little
LINE 25: every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help
LINE 26: me through the day."
LINE 27: Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round
LINE 28: her, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression
LINE 29: so seldom seen on her restless face.
LINE 30: "How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the
LINE 31: hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,"
LINE 32: whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'
LINE 33: example.
LINE 34: "I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy; and then the rooms were very still
LINE 35: while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to
LINE 36: touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.
LINE 37: "Where is mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for
LINE 38: their gifts, half an hour later.
LINE 39: "Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went
LINE 40: straight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for
LINE 41: givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin'," replied Hannah, who
LINE 42: had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them
LINE 43: all more as a friend than a servant.
LINE 44: "She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything
LINE 45: ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a
LINE 46: basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.
LINE 47: "Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?" she added, as the little flask
LINE 48: did not appear.
LINE 49: "She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on
LINE 50: it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the
LINE 51: first stiffness off the new army-slippers.
LINE 52: "How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed
LINE 53: them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth, looking proudly
LINE 54: at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.
LINE 55: "Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.
LINE 56: March.' How funny!" cried Jo, taking up one.
LINE 57: "Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's
LINE 58: initials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,"
LINE 59: said Beth, looking troubled.
LINE 60: "It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for
LINE 61: no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know," said
LINE 62: Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.
LINE 63: "There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door slammed,
LINE 64: and steps sounded in the hall.
LINE 65: Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters
LINE 66: all waiting for her.
LINE 67: "Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?" asked Meg,
LINE 68: surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so
LINE 69: early.
LINE 70: "Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time
LINE 71: came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave
LINE 72: _all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any
LINE 73: more."
LINE 74: As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
LINE 75: one; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget
LINE 76: herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her "a
LINE 77: trump," while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to
LINE 78: ornament the stately bottle.
LINE 79: "You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about
LINE 80: being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
LINE 81: minute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now."
LINE 82: Another bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
LINE 83: girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
LINE 84: "Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read
LINE 85: some, and mean to every day," they cried, in chorus.
LINE 86: "Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope
LINE 87: you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far
LINE 88: away from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six
LINE 89: children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have
LINE 90: no fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to
LINE 91: tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give
LINE 92: them your breakfast as a Christmas present?"
LINE 93: They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a
LINE 94: minute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--
LINE 95: "I'm so glad you came before we began!"
LINE 96: "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?" asked
LINE 97: Beth, eagerly.
LINE 98: "_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins," added Amy, heroically giving
LINE 99: up the articles she most liked.
LINE 100: Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one
LINE 101: big plate.
LINE 102: "I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. "You
LINE 103: shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and
LINE 104: milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time."
LINE 105: They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was
LINE 106: early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and
LINE 107: no one laughed at the queer party.
LINE 108: [Illustration: The procession set out]
LINE 109: A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,
LINE 110: ragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,
LINE 111: hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.
LINE 112: How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!
LINE 113: "Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!" said the poor woman,
LINE 114: crying for joy.
LINE 115: "Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them laughing.
LINE 116: In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work
LINE 117: there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the
LINE 118: broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother
LINE 119: tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she
LINE 120: dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The
LINE 121: girls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and
LINE 122: fed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to
LINE 123: understand the funny broken English.
LINE 124: "Das ist gut!" "Die Engel-kinder!" cried the poor things, as they ate,
LINE 125: and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.
LINE 126: The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it
LINE 127: very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a "Sancho" ever
LINE 128: since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't
LINE 129: get any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think
LINE 130: there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry
LINE 131: little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves
LINE 132: with bread and milk on Christmas morning.
LINE 133: "That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it," said
LINE 134: Meg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs
LINE 135: collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.
LINE 136: Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in
LINE 137: the few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white
LINE 138: chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave
LINE 139: quite an elegant air to the table.
LINE 140: "She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for
LINE 141: Marmee!" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to
LINE 142: the seat of honor.
LINE 143: Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted
LINE 144: escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;
LINE 145: and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the
LINE 146: little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new
LINE 147: handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's
LINE 148: cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were
LINE 149: pronounced a "perfect fit."
LINE 150: There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the
LINE 151: simple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at
LINE 152: the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to
LINE 153: work.
LINE 154: The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of
LINE 155: the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being
LINE 156: still too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to
LINE 157: afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their
LINE 158: wits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made
LINE 159: whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their
LINE 160: productions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned
LINE 161: butter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,
LINE 162: glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered
LINE 163: with the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids
LINE 164: of tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being
LINE 165: turned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent
LINE 166: revels.
LINE 167: No gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's
LINE 168: content, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots
LINE 169: given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,
LINE 170: an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some
LINE 171: picture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The
LINE 172: smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors
LINE 173: to take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit
LINE 174: for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,
LINE 175: whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.
LINE 176: It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and
LINE 177: employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or
LINE 178: spent in less profitable society.
LINE 179: On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the
LINE 180: dress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a
LINE 181: most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling
LINE 182: and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an
LINE 183: occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the
LINE 184: excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew
LINE 185: apart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.
LINE 186: "A gloomy wood," according to the one play-bill, was represented by a
LINE 187: few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the
LINE 188: distance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus
LINE 189: for walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot
LINE 190: on it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the
LINE 191: glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued
LINE 192: from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed
LINE 193: for the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with
LINE 194: a clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious
LINE 195: cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he
LINE 196: struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his
LINE 197: hatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to
LINE 198: kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an
LINE 199: occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,
LINE 200: and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with
LINE 201: the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and
LINE 202: ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding "What ho, minion! I need
LINE 203: thee!"
LINE 204: [Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]
LINE 205: Out came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and
LINE 206: black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded
LINE 207: a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in
LINE 208: a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the
LINE 209: spirit who would bring the love philter:--
LINE 210: "Hither, hither, from thy home,
LINE 211: Airy sprite, I bid thee come!
LINE 212: Born of roses, fed on dew,
LINE 213: Charms and potions canst thou brew?
LINE 214: Bring me here, with elfin speed,
LINE 215: The fragrant philter which I need;
LINE 216: Make it sweet and swift and strong,
LINE 217: Spirit, answer now my song!"
LINE 218: [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]
LINE 219: A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave
LINE 220: appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden
LINE 221: hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--
LINE 222: "Hither I come,
LINE 223: From my airy home,
LINE 224: Afar in the silver moon.
LINE 225: Take the magic spell,
LINE 226: And use it well,
LINE 227: Or its power will vanish soon!"
LINE 228: And, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit
LINE 229: vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a
LINE 230: lovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having
LINE 231: croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a
LINE 232: mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his
LINE 233: boots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had
LINE 234: killed a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and
LINE 235: intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain
LINE 236: fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits
LINE 237: of the play.
LINE 238: A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when
LINE 239: it became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got
LINE 240: up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to
LINE 241: the ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,
LINE 242: and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver
LINE 243: dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,
LINE 244: red cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.
LINE 245: Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.
LINE 246: Zara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came
LINE 247: the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five
LINE 248: steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she
LINE 249: crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was
LINE 250: about to leap gracefully down, when, "Alas! alas for Zara!" she forgot
LINE 251: her train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,
LINE 252: fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!
LINE 253: A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the
LINE 254: wreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, "I told you so! I told you
LINE 255: so!" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed
LINE 256: in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--
LINE 257: "Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!"--and, ordering Roderigo up,
LINE 258: banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly
LINE 259: shaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old
LINE 260: gentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she
LINE 261: also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons
LINE 262: of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them
LINE 263: away, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech
LINE 264: he ought to have made.
LINE 265: Act third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to
LINE 266: free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees
LINE 267: him put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little
LINE 268: servant "Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall
LINE 269: come anon." The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and
LINE 270: Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,
LINE 271: the "minion," carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds
LINE 272: the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long
LINE 273: warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching
LINE 274: and stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has
LINE 275: done in a song of exquisite power and melody.
LINE 276: This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought
LINE 277: that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred
LINE 278: the effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and
LINE 279: with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was
LINE 280: considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put
LINE 281: together.
LINE 282: Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing
LINE 283: himself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as
LINE 284: the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,
LINE 285: informing him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if
LINE 286: he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of
LINE 287: rapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his
LINE 288: lady-love.
LINE 289: Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He
LINE 290: wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a
LINE 291: touching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands
LINE 292: her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and
LINE 293: gesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to
LINE 294: bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a
LINE 295: letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The
LINE 296: latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young
LINE 297: pair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The
LINE 298: bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the
LINE 299: stage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely
LINE 300: softens the "stern sire": he consents without a murmur, all join in a
LINE 301: joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive
LINE 302: Don Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.
LINE 303: [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing]
LINE 304: Tumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the
LINE 305: cot-bed, on which the "dress-circle" was built, suddenly shut up, and
LINE 306: extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to
LINE 307: the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless
LINE 308: with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,
LINE 309: with "Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to
LINE 310: supper."
LINE 311: This was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,
LINE 312: they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to
LINE 313: get up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was
LINE 314: unheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was
LINE 315: ice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and
LINE 316: fruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,
LINE 317: four great bouquets of hot-house flowers!
LINE 318: It quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and
LINE 319: then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.
LINE 320: "Is it fairies?" asked Amy,
LINE 321: "It's Santa Claus," said Beth.
LINE 322: "Mother did it"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard
LINE 323: and white eyebrows.
LINE 324: "Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper," cried Jo, with a
LINE 325: sudden inspiration.
LINE 326: "All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.
LINE 327: "The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into
LINE 328: his head? We don't know him!" exclaimed Meg.
LINE 329: "Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an
LINE 330: odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;
LINE 331: and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would
LINE 332: allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending
LINE 333: them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you
LINE 334: have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk
LINE 335: breakfast."
LINE 336: "That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,
LINE 337: and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us;
LINE 338: but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when
LINE 339: we pass," said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt
LINE 340: out of sight, with "Ohs!" and "Ahs!" of satisfaction.
LINE 341: "You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?"
LINE 342: asked one of the girls. "My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's
LINE 343: very proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his
LINE 344: grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and
LINE 345: makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't
LINE 346: come. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls."
LINE 347: "Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the
LINE 348: fence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so
LINE 349: on,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some
LINE 350: day; for he needs fun, I'm sure he does," said Jo decidedly.
LINE 351: [Illustration: We talked over the fence]
LINE 352: "I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I've no
LINE 353: objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought
LINE 354: the flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure
LINE 355: what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,
LINE 356: hearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own."
LINE 357: "It's a mercy you didn't, mother!" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.
LINE 358: "But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps
LINE 359: he'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?"
LINE 360: "I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!" And Meg
LINE 361: examined her flowers with great interest.
LINE 362: "They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me," said Mrs.
LINE 363: March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.
LINE 364: Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, "I wish I could send my
LINE 365: bunch to father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we
LINE 366: are."
LINE 367: [Illustration: Tail-piece]
LINE 368: [Illustration: Eating apples and crying over the "Heir of Redclyffe"]
