LINE 1: It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in
LINE 2: another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when
LINE 3: the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved
LINE 4: presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo
LINE 5: found her promise very hard to keep. How could she "comfort father and
LINE 6: mother," when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her
LINE 7: sister; how could she "make the house cheerful," when all its light and
LINE 8: warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home
LINE 9: for the new; and where in all the world could she "find some useful,
LINE 10: happy work to do," that would take the place of the loving service which
LINE 11: had been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her
LINE 12: duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust
LINE 13: that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life
LINE 14: get harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all
LINE 15: sunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than
LINE 16: Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble,
LINE 17: and hard work.
LINE 18: Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came
LINE 19: over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,
LINE 20: devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never
LINE 21: seemed to grow any easier. "I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life
LINE 22: like this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if
LINE 23: somebody don't come and help me," she said to herself, when her first
LINE 24: efforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind
LINE 25: which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.
LINE 26: But some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good
LINE 27: angels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple
LINE 28: spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,
LINE 29: thinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed
LINE 30: made her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, "O Beth,
LINE 31: come back! come back!" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in
LINE 32: vain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her
LINE 33: sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with
LINE 34: words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
LINE 35: that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken
LINE 36: whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went
LINE 37: hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to
LINE 38: heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,
LINE 39: which chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden
LINE 40: seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more
LINE 41: endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.
LINE 42: When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found
LINE 43: help; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray
LINE 44: head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very
LINE 45: humbly,--
LINE 46: "Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for
LINE 47: I'm all wrong."
LINE 48: "My dear, nothing can comfort me like this," he answered, with a falter
LINE 49: in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and
LINE 50: did not fear to ask it.
LINE 51: [Illustration: Jo and her father]
LINE 52: Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her
LINE 53: troubles,--the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that
LINE 54: discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all
LINE 55: the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire
LINE 56: confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation
LINE 57: in the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only
LINE 58: as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve
LINE 59: each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,
LINE 60: thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called "the church of
LINE 61: one member," and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered
LINE 62: cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had
LINE 63: taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach
LINE 64: another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its
LINE 65: beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.
LINE 66: Other helps had Jo,--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would
LINE 67: not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to
LINE 68: see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as
LINE 69: they once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of
LINE 70: her housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old
LINE 71: brush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself
LINE 72: humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and
LINE 73: giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and
LINE 74: cosey, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she
LINE 75: didn't know it, till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the
LINE 76: hand,--
LINE 77: "You thoughtful creter, you're determined we sha'n't miss that dear lamb
LINE 78: ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the Lord will
LINE 79: bless you for't, see ef He don't."
LINE 80: As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister
LINE 81: Meg was; how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly
LINE 82: impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and
LINE 83: children, and how much they were all doing for each other.
LINE 84: "Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom
LINE 85: out half as well as you have, if I tried it?" said Jo, as she
LINE 86: constructed a kite for Demi, in the topsy-turvy nursery.
LINE 87: "It's just what you need to bring out the tender, womanly half of your
LINE 88: nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut-burr, prickly outside, but
LINE 89: silky-soft within, and a sweet kernel, if one can only get at it. Love
LINE 90: will make you show your heart some day, and then the rough burr will
LINE 91: fall off."
LINE 92: "Frost opens chestnut-burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring
LINE 93: them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,"
LINE 94: returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would
LINE 95: ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.
LINE 96: Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but
LINE 97: she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her
LINE 98: power; and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
LINE 99: Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.
LINE 100: Grief is the best opener for some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for
LINE 101: the bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's
LINE 102: impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the
LINE 103: burr, and find the kernel sound and sweet. If she had suspected this,
LINE 104: she would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever;
LINE 105: fortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when the time came,
LINE 106: down she dropped.
LINE 107: Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral story-book, she ought at
LINE 108: this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the
LINE 109: world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in
LINE 110: her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine; she was only a struggling
LINE 111: human girl, like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature,
LINE 112: being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It's
LINE 113: highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once,
LINE 114: and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,
LINE 115: before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so
LINE 116: far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did
LINE 117: not; but to do it cheerfully--ah, that was another thing! She had often
LINE 118: said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard; and now
LINE 119: she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her
LINE 120: life to father and mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they
LINE 121: had to her? And, if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor
LINE 122: of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than
LINE 123: to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for
LINE 124: others?
LINE 125: Providence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she
LINE 126: had expected, but better, because self had no part in it: now, could she
LINE 127: do it? She decided that she would try; and, in her first attempt, she
LINE 128: found the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she
LINE 129: took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the
LINE 130: refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed
LINE 131: the hill called Difficulty.
LINE 132: "Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy," said her
LINE 133: mother, once, when the desponding fit overshadowed Jo.
LINE 134: "I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things."
LINE 135: "We do; write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.
LINE 136: Try it, dear; I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much."
LINE 137: "Don't believe I can;" but Jo got out her desk, and began to overhaul
LINE 138: her half-finished manuscripts.
LINE 139: An hour afterward her mother peeped in, and there she was, scratching
LINE 140: away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which
LINE 141: caused Mrs. March to smile, and slip away, well pleased with the success
LINE 142: of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into
LINE 143: that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it; for,
LINE 144: when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much
LINE 145: against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and, to her utter
LINE 146: surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from
LINE 147: several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the
LINE 148: little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends
LINE 149: admired it. For a small thing it was a great success; and Jo was more
LINE 150: astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.
LINE 151: "I don't understand it. What _can_ there be in a simple little story
LINE 152: like that, to make people praise it so?" she said, quite bewildered.
LINE 153: "There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret; humor and pathos make it
LINE 154: alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thought
LINE 155: of fame or money, and put your heart into it, my daughter; you have had
LINE 156: the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we
LINE 157: are in your success."
LINE 158: "If there _is_ anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine; I
LINE 159: owe it all to you and mother and to Beth," said Jo, more touched by her
LINE 160: father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.
LINE 161: So, taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent
LINE 162: them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very
LINE 163: charitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly
LINE 164: welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful
LINE 165: children whom good fortune overtakes.
LINE 166: When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo
LINE 167: would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set
LINE 168: at rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly,
LINE 169: and was full of hopes and plans for "the children" before she read the
LINE 170: letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the
LINE 171: other in lover-like fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to
LINE 172: think of, for no one had any objection to make.
LINE 173: "You like it, mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written
LINE 174: sheets, and looked at one another.
LINE 175: "Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused
LINE 176: Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the
LINE 177: 'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her
LINE 178: letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day."
LINE 179: "How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to
LINE 180: me."
LINE 181: "Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have
LINE 182: girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest
LINE 183: you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled."
LINE 184: "I'm not the scatter-brain I was; you may trust me, I'm sober and
LINE 185: sensible enough for any one's _confidante_ now."
LINE 186: "So you are, dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it
LINE 187: might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else."
LINE 188: "Now, mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,
LINE 189: after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?"
LINE 190: "I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he
LINE 191: came back, and asked again, you might, perhaps, feel like giving another
LINE 192: answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely,
LINE 193: and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart;
LINE 194: so I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now."
LINE 195: "No, mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to love
LINE 196: him. But you are right in one thing: I _am_ lonely, and perhaps if Teddy
LINE 197: had tried again, I might have said 'Yes,' not because I love him any
LINE 198: more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away."
LINE 199: "I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are
LINE 200: plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother,
LINE 201: sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all
LINE 202: comes to give you your reward."
LINE 203: "Mothers are the _best_ lovers in the world; but I don't mind whispering
LINE 204: to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the
LINE 205: more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the
LINE 206: more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many; mine is
LINE 207: so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented
LINE 208: with my family. I don't understand it."
LINE 209: "I do;" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the
LINE 210: leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.
LINE 211: "It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me; he isn't
LINE 212: sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he
LINE 213: says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem
LINE 214: to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender
LINE 215: he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of
LINE 216: noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's
LINE 217: mine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now
LINE 218: with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may,
LINE 219: and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all
LINE 220: my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets
LINE 221: us be together. O mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world
LINE 222: could be, when two people love and live for one another!"
LINE 223: "And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work
LINE 224: miracles. How very, very happy they must be!" And Jo laid the rustling
LINE 225: sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a
LINE 226: lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he
LINE 227: finds himself alone in the work-a-day world again.
LINE 228: By and by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not
LINE 229: walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,
LINE 230: not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one
LINE 231: sister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true;
LINE 232: she knew that, and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for
LINE 233: affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for
LINE 234: some one to "love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them
LINE 235: be together."
LINE 236: Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended, stood four little
LINE 237: wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each
LINE 238: filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo
LINE 239: glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the
LINE 240: edge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of
LINE 241: old exercise-books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over,
LINE 242: and re-lived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled
LINE 243: at first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a
LINE 244: little message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to
LINE 245: tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the
LINE 246: friendly words, as if they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot
LINE 247: in her heart.
LINE 248: "Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely
LINE 249: come."
LINE 250: "Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my
LINE 251: dear old Fritz, I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now
LINE 252: how I should love to see him, for every one seems going away from me,
LINE 253: and I'm all alone."
LINE 254: And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be
LINE 255: fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag-bag, and cried, as
LINE 256: if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.
LINE 257: [Illustration: Jo laid her head on a comfortable rag-bag and cried]
LINE 258: Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? or was it the waking
LINE 259: up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer?
LINE 260: Who shall say?
LINE 261: [Illustration: A substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her]
