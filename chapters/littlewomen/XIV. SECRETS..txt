LINE 1: Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow
LINE 2: chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun
LINE 3: lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,
LINE 4: writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,
LINE 5: while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied
LINE 6: by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of
LINE 7: his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the
LINE 8: last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and
LINE 9: threw down her pen, exclaiming,--
LINE 10: "There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till
LINE 11: I can do better."
LINE 12: Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,
LINE 13: making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,
LINE 14: which looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red
LINE 15: ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,
LINE 16: which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here
LINE 17: was an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her
LINE 18: papers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being
LINE 19: likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of
LINE 20: such books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin
LINE 21: receptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her
LINE 22: pocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her
LINE 23: pens and taste her ink.
LINE 24: She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to
LINE 25: the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung
LINE 26: herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
LINE 27: Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled
LINE 28: away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.
LINE 29: If any one had been watching her, he would have thought her movements
LINE 30: decidedly peculiar; for, on alighting, she went off at a great pace till
LINE 31: she reached a certain number in a certain busy street; having found the
LINE 32: place with some difficulty, she went into the door-way, looked up the
LINE 33: dirty stairs, and, after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived
LINE 34: into the street, and walked away as rapidly as she came. This
LINE 35: man≈ìuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a
LINE 36: black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building
LINE 37: opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,
LINE 38: pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if
LINE 39: she were going to have all her teeth out.
LINE 40: There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,
LINE 41: and, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly
LINE 42: opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young
LINE 43: gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself
LINE 44: in the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--
LINE 45: "It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some
LINE 46: one to help her home."
LINE 47: In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the
LINE 48: general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying
LINE 49: ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked
LINE 50: anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking
LINE 51: with an air of sympathy,--
LINE 52: "Did you have a bad time?"
LINE 53: "Not very."
LINE 54: "You got through quickly."
LINE 55: "Yes, thank goodness!"
LINE 56: "Why did you go alone?"
LINE 57: "Didn't want any one to know."
LINE 58: "You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?"
LINE 59: Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to
LINE 60: laugh, as if mightily amused at something.
LINE 61: "There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week."
LINE 62: "What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo," said
LINE 63: Laurie, looking mystified.
LINE 64: "So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?"
LINE 65: "Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a
LINE 66: gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."
LINE 67: "I'm glad of that."
LINE 68: "Why?"
LINE 69: "You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and
LINE 70: we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."
LINE 71: Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several
LINE 72: passers-by smile in spite of themselves.
LINE 73: "I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will
LINE 74: straighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only
LINE 75: reason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?"
LINE 76: "No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you
LINE 77: never go to such places. Do you?"
LINE 78: "Not often."
LINE 79: "I wish you wouldn't."
LINE 80: "It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless you
LINE 81: have good players; so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have a
LINE 82: game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."
LINE 83: "Oh dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,
LINE 84: and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did
LINE 85: hope you'd stay respectable, and be a satisfaction to your friends,"
LINE 86: said Jo, shaking her head.
LINE 87: "Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without
LINE 88: losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking nettled.
LINE 89: "That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned and his
LINE 90: set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him at our
LINE 91: house, though he wants to come; and if you grow like him she won't be
LINE 92: willing to have us frolic together as we do now."
LINE 93: "Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.
LINE 94: "No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in
LINE 95: bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."
LINE 96: "Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet; I'm not a fashionable
LINE 97: party, and don't mean to be; but I do like harmless larks now and then,
LINE 98: don't you?"
LINE 99: "Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you? or
LINE 100: there will be an end of all our good times."
LINE 101: "I'll be a double-distilled saint."
LINE 102: "I can't bear saints: just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and
LINE 103: we'll never desert you. I don't know what I _should_ do if you acted
LINE 104: like Mr. King's son; he had plenty of money, but didn't know how to
LINE 105: spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his
LINE 106: father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid."
LINE 107: "You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged."
LINE 108: "No, I don't--oh, _dear_, no!--but I hear people talking about money
LINE 109: being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor; I shouldn't
LINE 110: worry then."
LINE 111: "Do you worry about me, Jo?"
LINE 112: "A little, when you look moody or discontented, as you sometimes do; for
LINE 113: you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm afraid
LINE 114: it would be hard to stop you."
LINE 115: Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she
LINE 116: had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips still
LINE 117: smiled as if at her warnings.
LINE 118: "Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?" he asked
LINE 119: presently.
LINE 120: "Of course not; why?"
LINE 121: "Because if you are, I'll take a 'bus; if you are not, I'd like to walk
LINE 122: with you, and tell you something very interesting."
LINE 123: "I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely."
LINE 124: "Very well, then; come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must
LINE 125: tell me yours."
LINE 126: "I haven't got any," began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that
LINE 127: she had.
LINE 128: "You know you have,--you can't hide anything; so up and 'fess, or I
LINE 129: won't tell," cried Laurie.
LINE 130: "Is your secret a nice one?"
LINE 131: "Oh, isn't it! all about people you know, and such fun! You ought to
LINE 132: hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you
LINE 133: begin."
LINE 134: "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?"
LINE 135: "Not a word."
LINE 136: "And you won't tease me in private?"
LINE 137: "I never tease."
LINE 138: "Yes, you do; you get everything you want out of people. I don't know
LINE 139: how you do it, but you are a born wheedler."
LINE 140: "Thank you; fire away."
LINE 141: "Well, I've left two stories with a newspaper man, and he's to give his
LINE 142: answer next week," whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.
LINE 143: "Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!" cried
LINE 144: Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight
LINE 145: of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children; for
LINE 146: they were out of the city now.
LINE 147: [Illustration: Hurrah for Miss March]
LINE 148: "Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say; but I couldn't rest till I
LINE 149: had tried, and I said nothing about it, because I didn't want any one
LINE 150: else to be disappointed."
LINE 151: "It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare,
LINE 152: compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be
LINE 153: fun to see them in print; and sha'n't we feel proud of our authoress?"
LINE 154: Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in; and a
LINE 155: friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.
LINE 156: "Where's _your_ secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you
LINE 157: again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed
LINE 158: up at a word of encouragement.
LINE 159: "I may get into a scrape for telling; but I didn't promise not to, so I
LINE 160: will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit
LINE 161: of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is."
LINE 162: "Is that all?" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and
LINE 163: twinkled, with a face full of mysterious intelligence.
LINE 164: "It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you
LINE 165: where it is."
LINE 166: "Tell, then."
LINE 167: Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a
LINE 168: comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both
LINE 169: surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, "How do you
LINE 170: know?"
LINE 171: "Saw it."
LINE 172: "Where?"
LINE 173: "Pocket."
LINE 174: "All this time?"
LINE 175: "Yes; isn't that romantic?"
LINE 176: "No, it's horrid."
LINE 177: "Don't you like it?"
LINE 178: "Of course I don't. It's ridiculous; it won't be allowed. My patience!
LINE 179: what would Meg say?"
LINE 180: "You are not to tell any one; mind that."
LINE 181: "I didn't promise."
LINE 182: "That was understood, and I trusted you."
LINE 183: "Well, I won't for the present, any way; but I'm disgusted, and wish you
LINE 184: hadn't told me."
LINE 185: "I thought you'd be pleased."
LINE 186: "At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you."
LINE 187: "You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away."
LINE 188: "I'd like to see any one try it," cried Jo fiercely.
LINE 189: "So should I!" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.
LINE 190: "I don't think secrets agree with me; I feel rumpled up in my mind since
LINE 191: you told me that," said Jo, rather ungratefully.
LINE 192: "Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right," suggested
LINE 193: Laurie.
LINE 194: No one was in sight; the smooth road sloped invitingly before her; and
LINE 195: finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat
LINE 196: and comb behind her, and scattering hair-pins as she ran. Laurie reached
LINE 197: the goal first, and was quite satisfied with the success of his
LINE 198: treatment; for his Atalanta came panting up, with flying hair, bright
LINE 199: eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.
LINE 200: [Illustration: Jo darted away]
LINE 201: "I wish I was a horse; then I could run for miles in this splendid air,
LINE 202: and not lose my breath. It was capital; but see what a guy it's made me.
LINE 203: Go, pick up my things, like a cherub as you are," said Jo, dropping down
LINE 204: under a maple-tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.
LINE 205: Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled
LINE 206: up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But
LINE 207: some one did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly
LINE 208: ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.
LINE 209: "What in the world are you doing here?" she asked, regarding her
LINE 210: dishevelled sister with well-bred surprise.
LINE 211: "Getting leaves," meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had
LINE 212: just swept up.
LINE 213: "And hair-pins," added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.
LINE 214: "They grow on this road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats."
LINE 215: "You have been running, Jo; how could you? When _will_ you stop such
LINE 216: romping ways?" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs, and
LINE 217: smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.
LINE 218: "Never till I'm stiff and old, and have to use a crutch. Don't try to
LINE 219: make me grow up before my time, Meg: it's hard enough to have you change
LINE 220: all of a sudden; let me be a little girl as long as I can."
LINE 221: As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips;
LINE 222: for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman,
LINE 223: and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come
LINE 224: some time, and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face, and
LINE 225: drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, "Where have you been
LINE 226: calling, all so fine?"
LINE 227: "At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle
LINE 228: Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the
LINE 229: winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!"
LINE 230: "Do you envy her, Meg?" said Laurie.
LINE 231: "I'm afraid I do."
LINE 232: "I'm glad of it!" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.
LINE 233: "Why?" asked Meg, looking surprised.
LINE 234: "Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a
LINE 235: poor man," said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to
LINE 236: mind what she said.
LINE 237: "I shall never '_go_ and marry' any one," observed Meg, walking on with
LINE 238: great dignity, while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping
LINE 239: stones, and "behaving like children," as Meg said to herself, though she
LINE 240: might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress
LINE 241: on.
LINE 242: For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite
LINE 243: bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang; was rude to
LINE 244: Mr. Brooke whenever they met; would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone
LINE 245: face, occasionally jumping up to shake, and then to kiss her, in a very
LINE 246: mysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one
LINE 247: another, and talking about "Spread Eagles," till the girls declared they
LINE 248: had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the
LINE 249: window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the
LINE 250: sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden, and finally capturing
LINE 251: her in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see; but shrieks
LINE 252: of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great
LINE 253: flapping of newspapers.
LINE 254: "What shall we do with that girl? She never _will_ behave like a young
LINE 255: lady," sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.
LINE 256: "I hope she won't; she is so funny and dear as she is," said Beth, who
LINE 257: had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets
LINE 258: with any one but her.
LINE 259: "It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_," added Amy,
LINE 260: who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a
LINE 261: very becoming way,--two agreeable things, which made her feel unusually
LINE 262: elegant and ladylike.
LINE 263: In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected
LINE 264: to read.
LINE 265: [Illustration: Jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read]
LINE 266: "Have you anything interesting there?" asked Meg, with condescension.
LINE 267: "Nothing but a story; won't amount to much, I guess," returned Jo,
LINE 268: carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.
LINE 269: "You'd better read it aloud; that will amuse us and keep you out of
LINE 270: mischief," said Amy, in her most grown-up tone.
LINE 271: "What's the name?" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the
LINE 272: sheet.
LINE 273: "The Rival Painters."
LINE 274: "That sounds well; read it," said Meg.
LINE 275: With a loud "Hem!" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The
LINE 276: girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat
LINE 277: pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.
LINE 278: "I like that about the splendid picture," was Amy's approving remark, as
LINE 279: Jo paused.
LINE 280: "I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite
LINE 281: names; isn't that queer?" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the "lovering
LINE 282: part" was tragical.
LINE 283: "Who wrote it?" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.
LINE 284: The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed
LINE 285: countenance, and, with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement,
LINE 286: replied in a loud voice, "Your sister."
LINE 287: "You?" cried Meg, dropping her work.
LINE 288: "It's very good," said Amy critically.
LINE 289: "I knew it! I knew it! O my Jo, I _am_ so proud!" and Beth ran to hug
LINE 290: her sister, and exult over this splendid success.
LINE 291: Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! how Meg wouldn't
LINE 292: believe it till she saw the words, "Miss Josephine March," actually
LINE 293: printed in the paper; how graciously Amy criticised the artistic parts
LINE 294: of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately
LINE 295: couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead; how Beth got
LINE 296: excited, and skipped and sung with joy; how Hannah came in to exclaim
LINE 297: "Sakes alive, well I never!" in great astonishment at "that Jo's
LINE 298: doin's;" how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it; how Jo laughed, with
LINE 299: tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and
LINE 300: done with it; and how the "Spread Eagle" might be said to flap his wings
LINE 301: triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to
LINE 302: hand.
LINE 303: "Tell us all about it." "When did it come?" "How much did you get for
LINE 304: it?" "What _will_ father say?" "Won't Laurie laugh?" cried the family,
LINE 305: all in one breath, as they clustered about Jo; for these foolish,
LINE 306: affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.
LINE 307: "Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything," said Jo,
LINE 308: wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her "Evelina" than she
LINE 309: did over her "Rival Painters." Having told how she disposed of her
LINE 310: tales, Jo added, "And when I went to get my answer, the man said he
LINE 311: liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his
LINE 312: paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said; and when
LINE 313: the beginners improved, any one would pay. So I let him have the two
LINE 314: stories, and to-day this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it,
LINE 315: and insisted on seeing it, so I let him; and he said it was good, and I
LINE 316: shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I _am_ so
LINE 317: happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls."
LINE 318: Jo's breath gave out here; and, wrapping her head in the paper, she
LINE 319: bedewed her little story with a few natural tears; for to be
LINE 320: independent, and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest
LINE 321: wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that
LINE 322: happy end.
