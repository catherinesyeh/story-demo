LINE 1: Like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The
LINE 2: invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning
LINE 3: early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all
LINE 4: day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats, at first, and, in time,
LINE 5: with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her once active
LINE 6: limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the
LINE 7: house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white
LINE 8: hands cooking delicate messes for "the dear;" while Amy, a loyal slave
LINE 9: of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her
LINE 10: treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.
LINE 11: As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,
LINE 12: and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible
LINE 13: or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry
LINE 14: Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had
LINE 15: bonfires, sky-rockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.
LINE 16: After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered
LINE 17: effectually quenched, and went about with forlorn faces, which were
LINE 18: rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.
LINE 19: Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid
LINE 20: Christmas Day. Hannah "felt in her bones" that it was going to be an
LINE 21: unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for
LINE 22: everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To
LINE 23: begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth
LINE 24: felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's
LINE 25: gift,--a soft crimson merino wrapper,--was borne in triumph to the
LINE 26: window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had
LINE 27: done their best to be worthy of the name, for, like elves, they had
LINE 28: worked by night, and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden
LINE 29: stood a stately snow-maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of
LINE 30: fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in the other, a
LINE 31: perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas
LINE 32: carol issuing from her lips, on a pink paper streamer:--
LINE 33: "THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH.
LINE 34: "God bless you, dear Queen Bess!
LINE 35: May nothing you dismay,
LINE 36: But health and peace and happiness
LINE 37: Be yours, this Christmas Day.
LINE 38: "Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,
LINE 39: And flowers for her nose;
LINE 40: Here's music for her pianee,
LINE 41: An Afghan for her toes.
LINE 42: "A portrait of Joanna, see,
LINE 43: By Raphael No. 2,
LINE 44: Who labored with great industry
LINE 45: To make it fair and true.
LINE 46: "Accept a ribbon red, I beg,
LINE 47: For Madam Purrer's tail;
LINE 48: And ice-cream made by lovely Peg,--
LINE 49: A Mont Blanc in a pail.
LINE 50: "Their dearest love my makers laid
LINE 51: Within my breast of snow:
LINE 52: Accept it, and the Alpine maid,
LINE 53: From Laurie and from Jo."
LINE 54: [Illustration: The Jungfrau]
LINE 55: How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in
LINE 56: the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them!
LINE 57: "I'm so full of happiness, that, if father was only here, I couldn't
LINE 58: hold one drop more," said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo
LINE 59: carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to
LINE 60: refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the "Jungfrau" had
LINE 61: sent her.
LINE 62: "So am I," added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the
LINE 63: long-desired Undine and Sintram.
LINE 64: "I'm sure I am," echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the
LINE 65: Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her, in a pretty frame.
LINE 66: "Of course I am!" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first
LINE 67: silk dress; for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.
LINE 68: "How can _I_ be otherwise?" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went
LINE 69: from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed
LINE 70: the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which
LINE 71: the girls had just fastened on her breast.
LINE 72: Now and then, in this work-a-day world, things do happen in the
LINE 73: delightful story-book fashion, and what a comfort that is. Half an hour
LINE 74: after every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one
LINE 75: drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door, and popped his
LINE 76: head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and
LINE 77: uttered an Indian war-whoop; for his face was so full of suppressed
LINE 78: excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful, that every one jumped
LINE 79: up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, "Here's another
LINE 80: Christmas present for the March family."
LINE 81: Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away
LINE 82: somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,
LINE 83: leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and
LINE 84: couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede; and for several
LINE 85: minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things
LINE 86: were done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the
LINE 87: embrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly
LINE 88: fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china-closet; Mr.
LINE 89: Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently
LINE 90: explained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never
LINE 91: stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most
LINE 92: touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held
LINE 93: up her hand with a warning, "Hush! remember Beth!"
LINE 94: But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper
LINE 95: appeared on the threshold,--joy put strength into the feeble limbs,--and
LINE 96: Beth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just
LINE 97: after that; for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness
LINE 98: of the past, and leaving only the sweetness of the present.
LINE 99: It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight
LINE 100: again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat
LINE 101: turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the
LINE 102: kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for
LINE 103: his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly
LINE 104: remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he
LINE 105: precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,
LINE 106: which they did, by both sitting in one big chair, and talking hard.
LINE 107: Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the
LINE 108: fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage
LINE 109: of it; how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most
LINE 110: estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just
LINE 111: there, and, after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,
LINE 112: looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you
LINE 113: to imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head, and asked,
LINE 114: rather abruptly, if he wouldn't have something to eat. Jo saw and
LINE 115: understood the look; and she stalked grimly away to get wine and
LINE 116: beef-tea, muttering to herself, as she slammed the door, "I hate
LINE 117: estimable young men with brown eyes!"
LINE 118: There never _was_ such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat
LINE 119: turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned,
LINE 120: and decorated; so was the plum-pudding, which quite melted in one's
LINE 121: mouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy revelled like a fly in a
LINE 122: honey-pot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,
LINE 123: "For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't
LINE 124: roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'
LINE 125: of it in a cloth."
LINE 126: Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,--at whom
LINE 127: Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy-chairs
LINE 128: stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her
LINE 129: father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank
LINE 130: healths, told stories, sung songs, "reminisced," as the old folks say,
LINE 131: and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh-ride had been planned, but the
LINE 132: girls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and,
LINE 133: as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.
LINE 134: "Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected
LINE 135: to have. Do you remember?" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had
LINE 136: followed a long conversation about many things.
LINE 137: "Rather a pleasant year on the whole!" said Meg, smiling at the fire,
LINE 138: and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.
LINE 139: "I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy, watching the light
LINE 140: shine on her ring, with thoughtful eyes.
LINE 141: "I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered Beth, who
LINE 142: sat on her father's knee.
LINE 143: "Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially
LINE 144: the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely; and I think the
LINE 145: burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon," said Mr. March,
LINE 146: looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered
LINE 147: round him.
LINE 148: "How do you know? Did mother tell you?" asked Jo.
LINE 149: "Not much; straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several
LINE 150: discoveries to-day."
LINE 151: "Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg, who sat beside him.
LINE 152: "Here is one;" and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair,
LINE 153: he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or
LINE 154: three little hard spots on the palm. "I remember a time when this hand
LINE 155: was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very
LINE 156: pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now,--for in these seeming
LINE 157: blemishes I read a little history. A burnt-offering has been made of
LINE 158: vanity; this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters;
LINE 159: and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long
LINE 160: time, so much good-will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value
LINE 161: the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or
LINE 162: fashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious
LINE 163: little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away."
LINE 164: If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it
LINE 165: in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he
LINE 166: gave her.
LINE 167: "What about Jo? Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,
LINE 168: and been so very, very good to me," said Beth, in her father's ear.
LINE 169: He laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an
LINE 170: unusually mild expression in her brown face.
LINE 171: "In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year
LINE 172: ago," said Mr. March. "I see a young lady who pins her collar straight,
LINE 173: laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on
LINE 174: the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale, just now,
LINE 175: with watching and anxiety; but I like to look at it, for it has grown
LINE 176: gentler, and her voice is lower; she doesn't bounce, but moves quietly,
LINE 177: and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which
LINE 178: delights me. I rather miss my wild girl; but if I get a strong, helpful,
LINE 179: tender-hearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't
LINE 180: know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in
LINE 181: all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought
LINE 182: with the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me."
LINE 183: Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy
LINE 184: in the firelight, as she received her father's praise, feeling that she
LINE 185: did deserve a portion of it.
LINE 186: "Now Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.
LINE 187: "There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will
LINE 188: slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be," began
LINE 189: their father cheerfully; but recollecting how nearly he _had_ lost her,
LINE 190: he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,
LINE 191: "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God."
LINE 192: After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket
LINE 193: at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair,--
LINE 194: "I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her
LINE 195: mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place to-night, and has waited
LINE 196: on every one with patience and good-humor. I also observe that she does
LINE 197: not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very
LINE 198: pretty ring which she wears; so I conclude that she has learned to think
LINE 199: of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and
LINE 200: mould her character as carefully as she moulds her little clay figures.
LINE 201: I am glad of this; for though I should be very proud of a graceful
LINE 202: statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter,
LINE 203: with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."
LINE 204: "What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her
LINE 205: father and told about her ring.
LINE 206: "I read in 'Pilgrim's Progress' to-day, how, after many troubles,
LINE 207: Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow, where lilies
LINE 208: bloomed all the year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,
LINE 209: before they went on to their journey's end," answered Beth; adding, as
LINE 210: she slipped out of her father's arms, and went slowly to the instrument,
LINE 211: "It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to
LINE 212: sing the song of the shepherd-boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the
LINE 213: music for father, because he likes the verses."
LINE 214: So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and,
LINE 215: in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sung to her own
LINE 216: accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for
LINE 217: her:--
LINE 218: "He that is down need fear no fall,
LINE 219: He that is low no pride;
LINE 220: He that is humble ever shall
LINE 221: Have God to be his guide.
LINE 222: "I am content with what I have,
LINE 223: Little be it or much;
LINE 224: And, Lord! contentment still I crave,
LINE 225: Because Thou savest such.
LINE 226: "Fulness to them a burden is,
LINE 227: That go on pilgrimage;
LINE 228: Here little, and hereafter bliss,
LINE 229: Is best from age to age!"
