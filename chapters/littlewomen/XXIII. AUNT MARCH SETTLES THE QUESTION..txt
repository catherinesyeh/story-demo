LINE 1: [Illustration: Popping in her head now and then]
LINE 2: Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about
LINE 3: Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and
LINE 4: listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by
LINE 5: kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the
LINE 6: other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then, "to
LINE 7: peek at the dear man," nothing seemed needed to complete their
LINE 8: happiness. But something _was_ needed, and the elder ones felt it,
LINE 9: though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another
LINE 10: with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden
LINE 11: fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's
LINE 12: umbrella, which had been left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy,
LINE 13: and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was
LINE 14: mentioned; Amy said "Every one seemed waiting for something, and
LINE 15: couldn't settle down, which was queer, since father was safe at home,"
LINE 16: and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as
LINE 17: usual.
LINE 18: [Illustration: "He sat in the big chair by Beth's sofa with the other
LINE 19: three close by."--Page 277.]
LINE 20: Laurie went by in the afternoon, and, seeing Meg at the window, seemed
LINE 21: suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down upon one
LINE 22: knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands
LINE 23: imploringly, as if begging some boon; and when Meg told him to behave
LINE 24: himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,
LINE 25: and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.
LINE 26: "What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing, and trying to look
LINE 27: unconscious.
LINE 28: "He's showing you how your John will go on by and by. Touching, isn't
LINE 29: it?" answered Jo scornfully.
LINE 30: "Don't say _my John_, it isn't proper or true;" but Meg's voice lingered
LINE 31: over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please don't plague
LINE 32: me, Jo; I've told you I don't care _much_ about him, and there isn't to
LINE 33: be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before."
LINE 34: "We can't, for something _has_ been said, and Laurie's mischief has
LINE 35: spoilt you for me. I see it, and so does mother; you are not like your
LINE 36: old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to
LINE 37: plague you, and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all
LINE 38: settled. I hate to wait; so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and
LINE 39: have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.
LINE 40: "_I_ can't say or do anything till he speaks, and he won't, because
LINE 41: father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work, with a
LINE 42: queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with
LINE 43: her father on that point.
LINE 44: "If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,
LINE 45: or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No."
LINE 46: "I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say,
LINE 47: for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no
LINE 48: knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared."
LINE 49: Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had
LINE 50: unconsciously assumed, and which was as becoming as the pretty color
LINE 51: varying in her cheeks.
LINE 52: "Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more respectfully.
LINE 53: "Not at all; you are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,
LINE 54: and my experience will be useful to you by and by, perhaps, in your own
LINE 55: affairs of this sort."
LINE 56: "Don't mean to have any; it's fun to watch other people philander, but I
LINE 57: should feel like a fool doing it myself," said Jo, looking alarmed at
LINE 58: the thought.
LINE 59: "I think not, if you liked any one very much, and he liked you." Meg
LINE 60: spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane, where she had often
LINE 61: seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.
LINE 62: "I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man," said Jo,
LINE 63: rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.
LINE 64: "Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.
LINE 65: Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with father that I am too young
LINE 66: to enter into any engagement at present; so please say no more, but let
LINE 67: us be friends as we were.'"
LINE 68: "Hum! that's stiff and cool enough. I don't believe you'll ever say it,
LINE 69: and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the
LINE 70: rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his
LINE 71: feelings."
LINE 72: "No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out
LINE 73: of the room with dignity."
LINE 74: Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified
LINE 75: exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat, and begin to
LINE 76: sew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given
LINE 77: time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and, when some one gave
LINE 78: a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect, which was anything but
LINE 79: hospitable.
LINE 80: "Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella,--that is, to see how your
LINE 81: father finds himself to-day," said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused
LINE 82: as his eye went from one tell-tale face to the other.
LINE 83: "It's very well, he's in the rack, I'll get him, and tell it you are
LINE 84: here," and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in
LINE 85: her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her
LINE 86: speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to
LINE 87: sidle towards the door, murmuring,--
LINE 88: "Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her."
LINE 89: "Don't go; are you afraid of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke looked so
LINE 90: hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She
LINE 91: blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called
LINE 92: her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet
LINE 93: it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her
LINE 94: ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said
LINE 95: gratefully,--
LINE 96: "How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father? I only wish I
LINE 97: could thank you for it."
LINE 98: [Illustration: Shall I tell you how?]
LINE 99: "Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in
LINE 100: both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown
LINE 101: eyes, that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away
LINE 102: and to stop and listen.
LINE 103: "Oh no, please don't--I'd rather not," she said, trying to withdraw her
LINE 104: hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.
LINE 105: "I won't trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little,
LINE 106: Meg. I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke tenderly.
LINE 107: This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it;
LINE 108: she forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, "I don't
LINE 109: know," so softly, that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish
LINE 110: little reply.
LINE 111: He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as
LINE 112: if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said, in his
LINE 113: most persuasive tone, "Will you try and find out? I want to know _so_
LINE 114: much; for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am
LINE 115: to have my reward in the end or not."
LINE 116: "I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet
LINE 117: rather enjoying it.
LINE 118: "I'll wait; and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would
LINE 119: it be a very hard lesson, dear?"
LINE 120: "Not if I chose to learn it, but--"
LINE 121: "Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than
LINE 122: German," broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that
LINE 123: she had no way of hiding her face, as he bent to look into it.
LINE 124: His tone was properly beseeching; but, stealing a shy look at him, Meg
LINE 125: saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the
LINE 126: satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled
LINE 127: her; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and
LINE 128: the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little
LINE 129: women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt
LINE 130: excited and strange, and, not knowing what else to do, followed a
LINE 131: capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, "I
LINE 132: _don't_ choose. Please go away and let me be!"
LINE 133: Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling
LINE 134: about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it
LINE 135: rather bewildered him.
LINE 136: "Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following her as she
LINE 137: walked away.
LINE 138: "Yes, I do; I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I
LINE 139: needn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not."
LINE 140: "Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by and by? I'll wait, and say
LINE 141: nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't
LINE 142: think that of you."
LINE 143: "Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't," said Meg, taking a
LINE 144: naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.
LINE 145: He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel
LINE 146: heroes whom she admired; but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped
LINE 147: about the room, as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully,
LINE 148: so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her. What
LINE 149: would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come
LINE 150: hobbling in at this interesting minute.
LINE 151: The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew; for she had
LINE 152: met Laurie as she took her airing, and, hearing of Mr. March's arrival,
LINE 153: drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part
LINE 154: of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise
LINE 155: them. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she
LINE 156: had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.
LINE 157: "Bless me, what's all this?" cried the old lady, with a rap of her cane,
LINE 158: as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.
LINE 159: [Illustration: Bless me, what's all this?]
LINE 160: "It's father's friend. I'm _so_ surprised to see you!" stammered Meg,
LINE 161: feeling that she was in for a lecture now.
LINE 162: "That's evident," returned Aunt March, sitting down. "But what is
LINE 163: father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief
LINE 164: going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is," with another rap.
LINE 165: "We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella," began Meg,
LINE 166: wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.
LINE 167: "Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo
LINE 168: blundered into a wrong message in one of your father's letters, and I
LINE 169: made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, child?" cried Aunt
LINE 170: March, looking scandalized.
LINE 171: "Hush! he'll hear. Sha'n't I call mother?" said Meg, much troubled.
LINE 172: "Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once.
LINE 173: Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my
LINE 174: money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl," said the
LINE 175: old lady impressively.
LINE 176: Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of
LINE 177: opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us
LINE 178: have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in
LINE 179: love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would
LINE 180: probably have declared she couldn't think of it; but as she was
LINE 181: peremptorily ordered _not_ to like him, she immediately made up her mind
LINE 182: that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision
LINE 183: easy, and, being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with
LINE 184: unusual spirit.
LINE 185: "I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money
LINE 186: to any one you like," she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.
LINE 187: "Highty tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, miss? You'll be
LINE 188: sorry for it, by and by, when you've tried love in a cottage, and found
LINE 189: it a failure."
LINE 190: "It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses," retorted
LINE 191: Meg.
LINE 192: Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did
LINE 193: not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so
LINE 194: brave and independent,--so glad to defend John, and assert her right to
LINE 195: love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and,
LINE 196: after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying, as mildly as she
LINE 197: could, "Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable, and take my advice. I mean it
LINE 198: kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake
LINE 199: at the beginning. You ought to marry well, and help your family; it's
LINE 200: your duty to make a rich match, and it ought to be impressed upon you."
LINE 201: "Father and mother don't think so; they like John, though he _is_ poor."
LINE 202: "Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than two babies."
LINE 203: "I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.
LINE 204: Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. "This Rook is
LINE 205: poor, and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"
LINE 206: "No; but he has many warm friends."
LINE 207: "You can't live on friends; try it, and see how cool they'll grow. He
LINE 208: hasn't any business, has he?"
LINE 209: "Not yet; Mr. Laurence is going to help him."
LINE 210: "That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow, and not
LINE 211: to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position,
LINE 212: or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be
LINE 213: comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you
LINE 214: had more sense, Meg."
LINE 215: "I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise;
LINE 216: he's got heaps of talent; he's willing to work, and sure to get on, he's
LINE 217: so energetic and brave. Every one likes and respects him, and I'm proud
LINE 218: to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly," said
LINE 219: Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.
LINE 220: "He knows _you_ have got rich relations, child; that's the secret of his
LINE 221: liking, I suspect."
LINE 222: "Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness,
LINE 223: and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so," cried Meg
LINE 224: indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's
LINE 225: suspicions. "My John wouldn't marry for money, anymore than I would. We
LINE 226: are willing to work, and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid of being poor,
LINE 227: for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him, because he
LINE 228: loves me, and I--"
LINE 229: Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up
LINE 230: her mind; that she had told "her John" to go away, and that he might be
LINE 231: overhearing her inconsistent remarks.
LINE 232: Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her
LINE 233: pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young
LINE 234: face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.
LINE 235: "Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a wilful child, and
LINE 236: you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't stop;
LINE 237: I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father now.
LINE 238: Don't expect anything from me when you are married; your Mr. Book's
LINE 239: friends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever."
LINE 240: And, slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high
LINE 241: dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her; for, when
LINE 242: left alone, Meg stood a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.
LINE 243: Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.
LINE 244: Brooke, who said, all in one breath, "I couldn't help hearing, Meg.
LINE 245: Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you _do_
LINE 246: care for me a little bit."
LINE 247: "I didn't know how much, till she abused you," began Meg.
LINE 248: "And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?"
LINE 249: Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately
LINE 250: exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself
LINE 251: forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, "Yes, John," and hiding her
LINE 252: face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.
LINE 253: Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly down
LINE 254: stairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and, hearing no sound
LINE 255: within, nodded and smiled, with a satisfied expression, saying to
LINE 256: herself, "She has sent him away as we planned, and that affair is
LINE 257: settled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it."
LINE 258: But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the
LINE 259: threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth
LINE 260: nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy,
LINE 261: and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an
LINE 262: objectionable lover, it certainly _was_ a shock to behold the aforesaid
LINE 263: enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strong-minded sister
LINE 264: enthroned upon his knee, and wearing an expression of the most abject
LINE 265: submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower-bath had
LINE 266: suddenly fallen upon her,--for such an unexpected turning of the tables
LINE 267: actually took her breath away. At the odd sound, the lovers turned and
LINE 268: saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy; but "that man," as
LINE 269: Jo called him, actually laughed, and said coolly, as he kissed the
LINE 270: astonished new-comer, "Sister Jo, congratulate us!"
LINE 271: That was adding insult to injury,--it was altogether too much,--and,
LINE 272: making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a
LINE 273: word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming
LINE 274: tragically, as she burst into the room, "Oh, _do_ somebody go down
LINE 275: quick; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!"
LINE 276: Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed; and, casting herself upon
LINE 277: the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news
LINE 278: to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most
LINE 279: agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them; so
LINE 280: she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to
LINE 281: the rats.
LINE 282: Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon; but a great
LINE 283: deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by
LINE 284: the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans,
LINE 285: and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.
LINE 286: The tea-bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which
LINE 287: he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both
LINE 288: looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy
LINE 289: was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity. Beth
LINE 290: beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the
LINE 291: young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident
LINE 292: Aunt March was right in calling them as "unworldly as a pair of babies."
LINE 293: No one ate much, but every one looked very happy, and the old room
LINE 294: seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family
LINE 295: began there.
LINE 296: "You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?" said
LINE 297: Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she
LINE 298: was planning to take.
LINE 299: "No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It seems
LINE 300: a year ago," answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream, lifted far above
LINE 301: such common things as bread and butter.
LINE 302: "The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the
LINE 303: changes have begun," said Mrs. March. "In most families there comes, now
LINE 304: and then, a year full of events; this has been such an one, but it ends
LINE 305: well, after all."
LINE 306: "Hope the next will end better," muttered Jo, who found it very hard to
LINE 307: see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face; for Jo loved a few
LINE 308: persons very dearly, and dreaded to have their affection lost or
LINE 309: lessened in any way.
LINE 310: "I hope the third year from this _will_ end better; I mean it shall, if
LINE 311: I live to work out my plans," said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if
LINE 312: everything had become possible to him now.
LINE 313: "Doesn't it seem very long to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for
LINE 314: the wedding.
LINE 315: "I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short
LINE 316: time to me," answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face, never seen
LINE 317: there before.
LINE 318: "You have only to wait; _I_ am to do the work," said John, beginning his
LINE 319: labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to
LINE 320: shake her head, and then say to herself, with an air of relief, as the
LINE 321: front door banged, "Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have a little
LINE 322: sensible conversation."
LINE 323: But Jo was mistaken; for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with
LINE 324: spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for "Mrs. John Brooke,"
LINE 325: and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been
LINE 326: brought about by his excellent management.
LINE 327: [Illustration: For Mrs. John Brooke]
LINE 328: "I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does; for when
LINE 329: he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done, though the sky
LINE 330: falls," said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his
LINE 331: congratulations.
LINE 332: "Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the
LINE 333: future, and invite you to my wedding on the spot," answered Mr. Brooke,
LINE 334: who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.
LINE 335: "I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth; for the sight of Jo's face
LINE 336: alone, on that occasion, would be worth a long journey. You don't look
LINE 337: festive, ma'am; what's the matter?" asked Laurie, following her into a
LINE 338: corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.
LINE 339: "I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and
LINE 340: shall not say a word against it," said Jo solemnly. "You can't know how
LINE 341: hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued, with a little quiver
LINE 342: in her voice.
LINE 343: "You don't give her up. You only go halves," said Laurie consolingly.
LINE 344: "It never can be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend," sighed
LINE 345: Jo.
LINE 346: "You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know; but I'll stand
LINE 347: by you, Jo, all the days of my life; upon my word I will!" and Laurie
LINE 348: meant what he said.
LINE 349: "I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged; you are always a great
LINE 350: comfort to me, Teddy," returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.
LINE 351: "Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right, you
LINE 352: see. Meg is happy; Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately;
LINE 353: grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her
LINE 354: own little house. We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I
LINE 355: shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad, or some
LINE 356: nice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you?"
LINE 357: "I rather think it would; but there's no knowing what may happen in
LINE 358: three years," said Jo thoughtfully.
LINE 359: "That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward, and see
LINE 360: where we shall all be then? I do," returned Laurie.
LINE 361: "I think not, for I might see something sad; and every one looks so
LINE 362: happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved," and Jo's eyes

LINE 365: Father and mother sat together, quietly re-living the first chapter of
LINE 366: the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing
LINE 367: the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light
LINE 368: of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not
LINE 369: copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who
LINE 370: held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead
LINE 371: him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low
LINE 372: seat, with the grave, quiet look which best became her; and Laurie,
LINE 373: leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly
LINE 374: head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long
LINE 375: glass which reflected them both.
LINE 376: * * * * *
LINE 377: So grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it
LINE 378: ever rises again, depends upon the reception given to the first act of
LINE 379: the domestic drama called "LITTLE WOMEN."
