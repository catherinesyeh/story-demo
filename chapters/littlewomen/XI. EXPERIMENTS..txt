LINE 1: "The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore to-morrow, and I'm
LINE 2: free. Three months' vacation,--how I shall enjoy it!" exclaimed Meg,
LINE 3: coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual
LINE 4: state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made
LINE 5: lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.
LINE 6: "Aunt March went to-day, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo. "I was
LINE 7: mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have
LINE 8: felt as if I ought to do it; but Plumfield is about as gay as a
LINE 9: churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry getting
LINE 10: the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I
LINE 11: was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and
LINE 12: sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked
LINE 13: till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for, as it
LINE 14: drove off, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josy-phine, won't you--?'
LINE 15: I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled; I did actually
LINE 16: run, and whisked round the corner, where I felt safe."
LINE 17: "Poor old Jo! she came in looking as if bears were after her," said
LINE 18: Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.
LINE 19: "Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy, tasting
LINE 20: her mixture critically.
LINE 21: "She means _vampire_, not sea-weed; but it doesn't matter; it's too warm
LINE 22: to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured Jo.
LINE 23: "What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing the subject,
LINE 24: with tact.
LINE 25: "I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from the depths of
LINE 26: the rocking-chair. "I've been routed up early all winter, and had to
LINE 27: spend my days working for other people; so now I'm going to rest and
LINE 28: revel to my heart's content."
LINE 29: "No," said Jo; "that dozy way wouldn't suit me. I've laid in a heap of
LINE 30: books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in
LINE 31: the old apple-tree, when I'm not having l------"
LINE 32: "Don't say 'larks!'" implored Amy, as a return snub for the "samphire"
LINE 33: correction.
LINE 34: "I'll say 'nightingales,' then, with Laurie; that's proper and
LINE 35: appropriate, since he's a warbler."
LINE 36: "Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time,
LINE 37: and rest, as the girls mean to," proposed Amy.
LINE 38: "Well, I will, if mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some new songs,
LINE 39: and my children need fitting up for the summer; they are dreadfully out
LINE 40: of order, and really suffering for clothes."
LINE 41: "May we, mother?" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing, in
LINE 42: what they called "Marmee's corner."
LINE 43: "You may try your experiment for a week, and see how you like it. I
LINE 44: think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as
LINE 45: bad as all work and no play."
LINE 46: "Oh, dear, no! it will be delicious, I'm sure," said Meg complacently.
LINE 47: "I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp,' says.
LINE 48: Fun forever, and no grubbing!" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the
LINE 49: lemonade went round.
LINE 50: They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the
LINE 51: rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock; her
LINE 52: solitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room seemed lonely and
LINE 53: untidy; for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's
LINE 54: books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but "Marmee's
LINE 55: corner," which looked as usual; and there Meg sat, to "rest and read,"
LINE 56: which meant yawn, and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get
LINE 57: with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river, with Laurie, and the
LINE 58: afternoon reading and crying over "The Wide, Wide World," up in the
LINE 59: apple-tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet,
LINE 60: where her family resided; but, getting tired before half done, she left
LINE 61: her establishment topsy-turvy, and went to her music, rejoicing that she
LINE 62: had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white
LINE 63: frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw, under the honeysuckles,
LINE 64: hoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no
LINE 65: one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-long-legs, who examined her work
LINE 66: with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home
LINE 67: dripping.
LINE 68: [Illustration: Amy sat down to draw]
LINE 69: At tea-time they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a
LINE 70: delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the
LINE 71: afternoon, and got a "sweet blue muslin," had discovered, after she had
LINE 72: cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her
LINE 73: slightly cross. Jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating, and got a
LINE 74: raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion
LINE 75: of her closet, and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at
LINE 76: once; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy
LINE 77: Brown's party was to be the next day; and now, like Flora McFlimsey, she
LINE 78: had "nothing to wear." But these were mere trifles; and they assured
LINE 79: their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said
LINE 80: nothing, and, with Hannah's help, did their neglected work, keeping home
LINE 81: pleasant, and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was
LINE 82: astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was
LINE 83: produced by the "resting and revelling" process. The days kept getting
LINE 84: longer and longer; the weather was unusually variable, and so were
LINE 85: tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed every one, and Satan found
LINE 86: plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury,
LINE 87: Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that
LINE 88: she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes, in her attempts to
LINE 89: furbish them up Ã  la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out, and she was
LINE 90: sick of books; got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a
LINE 91: quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished
LINE 92: she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was
LINE 93: constantly forgetting that it was to be _all play, and no work_, and
LINE 94: fell back into her old ways now and then; but something in the air
LINE 95: affected her, and, more than once, her tranquillity was much disturbed;
LINE 96: so much so, that, on one occasion, she actually shook poor dear Joanna,
LINE 97: and told her she was "a fright." Amy fared worst of all, for her
LINE 98: resources were small; and when her sisters left her to amuse and care
LINE 99: for herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self
LINE 100: a great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy-tales were childish, and
LINE 101: one couldn't draw all the time; tea-parties didn't amount to much,
LINE 102: neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. "If one could have a
LINE 103: fine house, full of nice girls, or go travelling, the summer would be
LINE 104: delightful; but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a
LINE 105: grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz," complained Miss
LINE 106: Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and _ennui_.
LINE 107: No one would own that they were tired of the experiment; but, by Friday
LINE 108: night, each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was
LINE 109: nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who
LINE 110: had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an
LINE 111: appropriate manner; so she gave Hannah a holiday, and let the girls
LINE 112: enjoy the full effect of the play system.
LINE 113: When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,
LINE 114: no breakfast in the dining-room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.
LINE 115: "Mercy on us! what _has_ happened?" cried Jo, staring about her in
LINE 116: dismay.
LINE 117: Meg ran upstairs, and soon came back again, looking relieved, but rather
LINE 118: bewildered, and a little ashamed.
LINE 119: "Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay
LINE 120: quietly in her room all day, and let us do the best we can. It's a very
LINE 121: queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself; but she
LINE 122: says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble, but take
LINE 123: care of ourselves."
LINE 124: "That's easy enough, and I like the idea; I'm aching for something to
LINE 125: do--that is, some new amusement, you know," added Jo quickly.
LINE 126: In fact it _was_ an immense relief to them all to have a little work,
LINE 127: and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's
LINE 128: saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke." There was plenty of food in the
LINE 129: larder, and, while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,
LINE 130: wondering, as they did so, why servants ever talked about hard work.
LINE 131: "I shall take some up to mother, though she said we were not to think of
LINE 132: her, for she'd take care of herself," said Meg, who presided, and felt
LINE 133: quite matronly behind the teapot.
LINE 134: So a tray was fitted out before any one began, and taken up, with the
LINE 135: cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelette
LINE 136: scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus; but Mrs. March
LINE 137: received her repast with thanks, and laughed heartily over it after Jo
LINE 138: was gone.
LINE 139: "Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid; but they
LINE 140: won't suffer, and it will do them good," she said, producing the more
LINE 141: palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of
LINE 142: the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt,--a motherly
LINE 143: little deception, for which they were grateful.
LINE 144: Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook
LINE 145: at her failures. "Never mind, I'll get the dinner, and be servant; you
LINE 146: be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders," said
LINE 147: Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.
LINE 148: This obliging offer was gladly accepted; and Margaret retired to the
LINE 149: parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the
LINE 150: sofa, and shutting the blinds, to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with
LINE 151: perfect faith in her own powers, and a friendly desire to make up the
LINE 152: quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to
LINE 153: dinner.
LINE 154: "You'd better see what you have got before you think of having company,"
LINE 155: said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.
LINE 156: "Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes; and I shall get some
LINE 157: asparagus, and a lobster, 'for a relish,' as Hannah says. We'll have
LINE 158: lettuce, and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll
LINE 159: have blanc-mange and strawberries for dessert; and coffee, too, if you
LINE 160: want to be elegant."
LINE 161: "Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but
LINE 162: gingerbread and molasses candy, fit to eat. I wash my hands of the
LINE 163: dinner-party; and, since you have asked Laurie on your own
LINE 164: responsibility, you may just take care of him."
LINE 165: "I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him, and help to the
LINE 166: pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?"
LINE 167: asked Jo, rather hurt.
LINE 168: "Yes; but I don't know much, except about bread, and a few trifles. You
LINE 169: had better ask mother's leave before you order anything," returned Meg
LINE 170: prudently.
LINE 171: "Of course I shall; I'm not a fool," and Jo went off in a huff at the
LINE 172: doubts expressed of her powers.
LINE 173: "Get what you like, and don't disturb me; I'm going out to dinner, and
LINE 174: can't worry about things at home," said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to
LINE 175: her. "I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation
LINE 176: to-day, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself."
LINE 177: The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably, and
LINE 178: reading, early in the morning, made Jo feel as if some natural
LINE 179: phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic
LINE 180: eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.
LINE 181: "Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself, going down
LINE 182: stairs. "There's Beth crying; that's a sure sign that something is wrong
LINE 183: with this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her."
LINE 184: Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to
LINE 185: find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage, with
LINE 186: his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for
LINE 187: want of which he had died.
LINE 188: "It's all my fault--I forgot him--there isn't a seed or a drop left. O
LINE 189: Pip! O Pip! how could I be so cruel to you?" cried Beth, taking the poor
LINE 190: thing in her hands, and trying to restore him.
LINE 191: [Illustration: O Pip! O Pip!]
LINE 192: Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him
LINE 193: stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino-box for a coffin.
LINE 194: "Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive," said Amy
LINE 195: hopefully.
LINE 196: "He's been starved, and he sha'n't be baked, now he's dead. I'll make
LINE 197: him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden; and I'll never have
LINE 198: another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one," murmured
LINE 199: Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.
LINE 200: "The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don't
LINE 201: cry, Bethy; it's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has
LINE 202: had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box;
LINE 203: and, after the dinner-party, we'll have a nice little funeral," said Jo,
LINE 204: beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.
LINE 205: Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which
LINE 206: was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron,
LINE 207: she fell to work, and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when
LINE 208: she discovered that the fire was out.
LINE 209: "Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove-door open,
LINE 210: and poking vigorously among the cinders.
LINE 211: Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the
LINE 212: water heated. The walk revived her spirits; and, flattering herself that
LINE 213: she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very
LINE 214: young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid
LINE 215: strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived, and
LINE 216: the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had
LINE 217: worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and
LINE 218: forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when
LINE 219: the door flew open, and a floury, crocky, flushed, and dishevelled
LINE 220: figure appeared, demanding tartly,--
LINE 221: "I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?"
LINE 222: Sallie began to laugh; but Meg nodded, and lifted her eyebrows as high
LINE 223: as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish, and put the
LINE 224: sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out,
LINE 225: after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word
LINE 226: of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding-sheet, while the dear
LINE 227: departed lay in state in the domino-box. A strange sense of helplessness
LINE 228: fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner; and
LINE 229: despair seized them, when, a few minutes later, Miss Crocker appeared,
LINE 230: and said she'd come to dinner. Now, this lady was a thin, yellow
LINE 231: spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything,
LINE 232: and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught
LINE 233: to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor, and had few
LINE 234: friends. So Meg gave her the easy-chair, and tried to entertain her,
LINE 235: while she asked questions, criticised everything, and told stories of
LINE 236: the people whom she knew.
LINE 237: Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which
LINE 238: Jo underwent that morning; and the dinner she served up became a
LINE 239: standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,
LINE 240: and discovered that something more than energy and good-will is
LINE 241: necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour, and was
LINE 242: grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.
LINE 243: The bread burnt black; for the salad-dressing so aggravated her, that
LINE 244: she let everything else go till she had convinced herself that she could
LINE 245: not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but
LINE 246: she hammered and poked, till it was unshelled, and its meagre
LINE 247: proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce-leaves. The potatoes had to
LINE 248: be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at
LINE 249: last. The blanc-mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as
LINE 250: they looked, having been skilfully "deaconed."
LINE 251: "Well, they can eat beef, and bread and butter, if they are hungry; only
LINE 252: it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,"
LINE 253: thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and
LINE 254: stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread for
LINE 255: Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose
LINE 256: curious eyes would mark all failures, and whose tattling tongue would
LINE 257: report them far and wide.
LINE 258: Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after
LINE 259: another was tasted and left; while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,
LINE 260: Miss Crocker pursed up her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all
LINE 261: his might, to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong
LINE 262: point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of
LINE 263: rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew
LINE 264: a long breath, as the pretty glass plates went round, and every one
LINE 265: looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream.
LINE 266: Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water
LINE 267: hastily. Jo, who had refused, thinking there might not be enough, for
LINE 268: they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he
LINE 269: was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his
LINE 270: mouth, and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of
LINE 271: delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her
LINE 272: napkin, and left the table precipitately.
LINE 273: [Illustration: Miss Crocker made a wry face]
LINE 274: "Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo trembling.
LINE 275: "Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg, with a
LINE 276: tragic gesture.
LINE 277: Jo uttered a groan, and fell back in her chair; remembering that she had
LINE 278: given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes
LINE 279: on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the
LINE 280: refrigerator. She turned scarlet, and was on the verge of crying, when
LINE 281: she met Laurie's eyes, which _would_ look merry in spite of his heroic
LINE 282: efforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she
LINE 283: laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did every one else, even
LINE 284: "Croaker," as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner
LINE 285: ended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.
LINE 286: "I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober
LINE 287: ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose; and Miss Crocker made
LINE 288: ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's
LINE 289: dinner-table.
LINE 290: They did sober themselves, for Beth's sake; Laurie dug a grave under the
LINE 291: ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears, by his
LINE 292: tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of
LINE 293: violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,
LINE 294: composed by Jo, while she struggled with the dinner:--
LINE 295: "Here lies Pip March,
LINE 296: Who died the 7th of June;
LINE 297: Loved and lamented sore,
LINE 298: And not forgotten soon."
LINE 299: At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome
LINE 300: with emotion and lobster; but there was no place of repose, for the beds
LINE 301: were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up
LINE 302: pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the
LINE 303: remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon, and left them so
LINE 304: tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.
LINE 305: Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour
LINE 306: cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came
LINE 307: home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the
LINE 308: afternoon; and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of
LINE 309: one part of the experiment.
LINE 310: Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a
LINE 311: scramble to get ready to see them; then tea must be got, errands done;
LINE 312: and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute.
LINE 313: As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered in the porch
LINE 314: where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or
LINE 315: sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.
LINE 316: "What a dreadful day this has been!" begun Jo, usually the first to
LINE 317: speak.
LINE 318: "It has seemed shorter than usual, but _so_ uncomfortable," said Meg.
LINE 319: "Not a bit like home," added Amy.
LINE 320: "It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth, glancing,
LINE 321: with full eyes, at the empty cage above her head.
LINE 322: "Here's mother, dear, and you shall have another bird to-morrow, if you
LINE 323: want it."
LINE 324: As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as
LINE 325: if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.
LINE 326: "Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another
LINE 327: week of it?" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her, and the rest turned
LINE 328: toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.
LINE 329: "I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.
LINE 330: "Nor I," echoed the others.
LINE 331: "You think, then, that it is better to have a few duties, and live a
LINE 332: little for others, do you?"
LINE 333: "Lounging and larking doesn't pay," observed Jo, shaking her head. "I'm
LINE 334: tired of it, and mean to go to work at something right off."
LINE 335: "Suppose you learn plain cooking; that's a useful accomplishment, which
LINE 336: no woman should be without," said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the
LINE 337: recollection of Jo's dinner-party; for she had met Miss Crocker, and
LINE 338: heard her account of it.
LINE 339: "Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd get
LINE 340: on?" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.
LINE 341: "Yes; I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing
LINE 342: her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on
LINE 343: pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable; so I
LINE 344: thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when every
LINE 345: one thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help
LINE 346: one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it
LINE 347: comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely
LINE 348: to us all?"
LINE 349: "We do, mother, we do!" cried the girls.
LINE 350: "Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though
LINE 351: they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn
LINE 352: to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it
LINE 353: keeps us from _ennui_ and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and
LINE 354: gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or
LINE 355: fashion."
LINE 356: "We'll work like bees, and love it too; see if we don't!" said Jo. "I'll
LINE 357: learn plain cooking for my holiday task; and the next dinner-party I
LINE 358: have shall be a success."
LINE 359: "I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,
LINE 360: Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing; that will be
LINE 361: better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as
LINE 362: they are," said Meg.
LINE 363: "I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music
