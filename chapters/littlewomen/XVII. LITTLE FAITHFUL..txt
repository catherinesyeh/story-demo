LINE 1: For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the
LINE 2: neighborhood. It was really amazing, for every one seemed in a heavenly
LINE 3: frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their
LINE 4: first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their
LINE 5: praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into the old ways.
LINE 6: They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to
LINE 7: grow easier; and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that
LINE 8: Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.
LINE 9: Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and
LINE 10: was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't
LINE 11: like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and
LINE 12: after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa
LINE 13: to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and
LINE 14: art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went
LINE 15: daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much
LINE 16: time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the
LINE 17: Washington despatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight
LINE 18: relapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were
LINE 19: faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were
LINE 20: forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone
LINE 21: a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears
LINE 22: for father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the
LINE 23: folds of a certain dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed
LINE 24: her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up
LINE 25: after a sober fit, but every one felt how sweet and helpful Beth was,
LINE 26: and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small
LINE 27: affairs.
LINE 28: All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character; and,
LINE 29: when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well, and
LINE 30: deserved praise. So they did; but their mistake was in ceasing to do
LINE 31: well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.
LINE 32: "Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels; you know mother told us not
LINE 33: to forget them," said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.
LINE 34: "I'm too tired to go this afternoon," replied Meg, rocking comfortably
LINE 35: as she sewed.
LINE 36: "Can't you, Jo?" asked Beth.
LINE 37: "Too stormy for me with my cold."
LINE 38: "I thought it was almost well."
LINE 39: "It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to
LINE 40: go to the Hummels'," said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of
LINE 41: her inconsistency.
LINE 42: "Why don't you go yourself?" asked Meg.
LINE 43: "I _have_ been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to
LINE 44: do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it;
LINE 45: but it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go."
LINE 46: Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go to-morrow.
LINE 47: "Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth; the air
LINE 48: will do you good," said Jo, adding apologetically, "I'd go, but I want
LINE 49: to finish my writing."
LINE 50: "My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought may be some of you would go,"
LINE 51: said Beth.
LINE 52: "Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us," suggested Meg.
LINE 53: "Well, I'll rest a little and wait for her."
LINE 54: So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the
LINE 55: Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed: Amy did not come; Meg went to
LINE 56: her room to try on a new dress; Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah
LINE 57: was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her
LINE 58: hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and
LINE 59: went out into the chilly air, with a heavy head, and a grieved look in
LINE 60: her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her
LINE 61: creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour
LINE 62: after Jo went to "mother's closet" for something, and there found Beth
LINE 63: sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes, and a
LINE 64: camphor-bottle in her hand.
LINE 65: "Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?" cried Jo, as Beth put out her
LINE 66: hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly,--
LINE 67: "You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?"
LINE 68: "Years ago, when Meg did. Why?"
LINE 69: "Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"
LINE 70: "What baby?"
LINE 71: "Mrs. Hummel's; it died in my lap before she got home," cried Beth, with
LINE 72: a sob.
LINE 73: "My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone," said Jo,
LINE 74: taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big chair,
LINE 75: with a remorseful face.
LINE 76: "It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute that it was
LINE 77: sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took
LINE 78: baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden it gave a
LINE 79: little cry, and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its
LINE 80: feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was
LINE 81: dead."
LINE 82: [Illustration: It didn't stir, and I knew it was dead]
LINE 83: "Don't cry, dear! What did you do?"
LINE 84: "I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He
LINE 85: said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have got sore
LINE 86: throats. 'Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before,' he said
LINE 87: crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby
LINE 88: herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the
LINE 89: others, and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was
LINE 90: kinder; but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round,
LINE 91: all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away,
LINE 92: or I'd have the fever."
LINE 93: "No, you won't!" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. "O
LINE 94: Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What _shall_
LINE 95: we do?"
LINE 96: "Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in
LINE 97: mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and
LINE 98: queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel
LINE 99: better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead, and
LINE 100: trying to look well.
LINE 101: "If mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and
LINE 102: feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a page, looked
LINE 103: at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely;
LINE 104: "You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the
LINE 105: others who are going to have it; so I'm afraid _you_ are going to have
LINE 106: it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness."
LINE 107: "Don't let Amy come; she never had it, and I should hate to give it to
LINE 108: her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth, anxiously.
LINE 109: "I guess not; don't care if I do; serve me right, selfish pig, to let
LINE 110: you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as she went to
LINE 111: consult Hannah.
LINE 112: The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,
LINE 113: assuring Jo that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet
LINE 114: fever, and, if rightly treated, nobody died,--all of which Jo believed,
LINE 115: and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.
LINE 116: "Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had examined
LINE 117: and questioned Beth; "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at
LINE 118: you, dear, and see that we start right; then we'll send Amy off to Aunt
LINE 119: March's, for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you
LINE 120: girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two."
LINE 121: "I shall stay, of course; I'm oldest," began Meg, looking anxious and
LINE 122: self-reproachful.
LINE 123: "_I_ shall, because it's my fault she is sick; I told mother I'd do the
LINE 124: errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.
LINE 125: "Which will you have, Beth? there ain't no need of but one," said
LINE 126: Hannah.
LINE 127: "Jo, please;" and Beth leaned her head against her sister, with a
LINE 128: contented look, which effectually settled that point.
LINE 129: "I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather
LINE 130: relieved, on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.
LINE 131: Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather
LINE 132: have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and
LINE 133: commanded: all in vain. Amy protested that she would _not_ go; and Meg
LINE 134: left her in despair, to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came
LINE 135: back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head
LINE 136: in the sofa-cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled; but
LINE 137: Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,
LINE 138: whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat
LINE 139: down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, "Now be a
LINE 140: sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what
LINE 141: a jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take
LINE 142: you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
LINE 143: Won't that be better than moping here?"
LINE 144: [Illustration: He sat down beside her]
LINE 145: "I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy, in an
LINE 146: injured voice.
LINE 147: "Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be
LINE 148: sick, do you?"
LINE 149: "No, I'm sure I don't; but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with
LINE 150: Beth all the time."
LINE 151: "That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may
LINE 152: escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say; or, if
LINE 153: it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you
LINE 154: to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss."
LINE 155: "But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy, looking
LINE 156: rather frightened.
LINE 157: "It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,
LINE 158: and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as
LINE 159: sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do."
LINE 160: "Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"
LINE 161: "On my honor as a gentleman."
LINE 162: "And come every single day?"
LINE 163: "See if I don't."
LINE 164: "And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"
LINE 165: "The identical minute."
LINE 166: "And go to the theatre, truly?"
LINE 167: "A dozen theatres, if we may."
LINE 168: "Well--I guess--I will," said Amy slowly.
LINE 169: "Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in," said Laurie, with an
LINE 170: approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the "giving in."
LINE 171: Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been
LINE 172: wrought; and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised
LINE 173: to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.
LINE 174: "How is the little dear?" asked Laurie; for Beth was his especial pet,
LINE 175: and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.
LINE 176: "She is lying down on mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death
LINE 177: troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah _says_ she
LINE 178: thinks so; but she _looks_ worried, and that makes me fidgety," answered
LINE 179: Meg.
LINE 180: "What a trying world it is!" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful
LINE 181: sort of way. "No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes
LINE 182: another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when mother's
LINE 183: gone; so I'm all at sea."
LINE 184: "Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle
LINE 185: your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do
LINE 186: anything?" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of
LINE 187: his friend's one beauty.
LINE 188: "That is what troubles me," said Meg. "I think we ought to tell her if
LINE 189: Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for mother can't leave
LINE 190: father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long, and
LINE 191: Hannah knows just what to do, and mother said we were to mind her, so I
LINE 192: suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me."
LINE 193: "Hum, well, I can't say; suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor
LINE 194: has been."
LINE 195: "We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once," commanded Meg; "we can't
LINE 196: decide anything till he has been."
LINE 197: "Stay where you are, Jo; I'm errand-boy to this establishment," said
LINE 198: Laurie, taking up his cap.
LINE 199: "I'm afraid you are busy," began Meg.
LINE 200: "No, I've done my lessons for the day."
LINE 201: "Do you study in vacation time?" asked Jo.
LINE 202: "I follow the good example my neighbors set me," was Laurie's answer, as
LINE 203: he swung himself out of the room.
LINE 204: "I have great hopes of my boy," observed Jo, watching him fly over the
LINE 205: fence with an approving smile.
LINE 206: "He does very well--for a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,
LINE 207: for the subject did not interest her.
LINE 208: Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but thought she
LINE 209: would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy
LINE 210: was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger,
LINE 211: she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.
LINE 212: Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.
LINE 213: "What do you want now?" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,
LINE 214: while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out,--
LINE 215: [Illustration: What do you want now?]
LINE 216: "Go away. No boys allowed here."
LINE 217: Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.
LINE 218: "No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among
LINE 219: poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,
LINE 220: which I've no doubt she will be,--looks like it now. Don't cry, child,
LINE 221: it worries me to hear people sniff."
LINE 222: Amy _was_ on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's
LINE 223: tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak, and call out,--
LINE 224: "Bless my boots!" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.
LINE 225: "What do you hear from your mother?" asked the old lady gruffly.
LINE 226: "Father is much better," replied Jo, trying to keep sober.
LINE 227: "Oh, is he? Well, that won't last long, I fancy; March never had any
LINE 228: stamina," was the cheerful reply.
LINE 229: "Ha, ha! never say die, take a pinch of snuff, good by, good by!"
LINE 230: squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap
LINE 231: as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.
LINE 232: "Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! and, Jo, you'd better go
LINE 233: at once; it isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a rattle-pated
LINE 234: boy like--"
LINE 235: "Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!" cried Polly, tumbling
LINE 236: off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the "rattle-pated" boy,
LINE 237: who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.
LINE 238: "I don't think I _can_ bear it, but I'll try," thought Amy, as she was
LINE 239: left alone with Aunt March.
LINE 240: "Get along, you fright!" screamed Polly; and at that rude speech Amy
LINE 241: could not restrain a sniff.
