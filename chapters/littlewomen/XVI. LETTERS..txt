LINE 1: In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp, and read their chapter
LINE 2: with an earnestness never felt before; for now the shadow of a real
LINE 3: trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort; and,
LINE 4: as they dressed, they agreed to say good-by cheerfully and hopefully,
LINE 5: and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or
LINE 6: complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went
LINE 7: down,--so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.
LINE 8: Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face
LINE 9: looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her night-cap on.
LINE 10: The big trunk stood ready in the hall, mother's cloak and bonnet lay on
LINE 11: the sofa, and mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and
LINE 12: worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to
LINE 13: keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself; Jo
LINE 14: was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once; and
LINE 15: the little girls' wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a
LINE 16: new experience to them.
LINE 17: Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near, and they sat waiting
LINE 18: for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied
LINE 19: about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of
LINE 20: her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up
LINE 21: her travelling bag,--
LINE 22: "Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection.
LINE 23: Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as
LINE 24: if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you
LINE 25: should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone,
LINE 26: or think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to
LINE 27: forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace.
LINE 28: Hope and keep busy; and whatever happens, remember that you never can be
LINE 29: fatherless."
LINE 30: "Yes, mother."
LINE 31: "Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in
LINE 32: any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get despondent
LINE 33: or do rash things; write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to
LINE 34: help and cheer us all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be
LINE 35: faithful to the little home duties; and you, Amy, help all you can, be
LINE 36: obedient, and keep happy safe at home."
LINE 37: "We will, mother! we will!"
LINE 38: The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.
LINE 39: That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well: no one cried, no
LINE 40: one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very
LINE 41: heavy as they sent loving messages to father, remembering, as they
LINE 42: spoke, that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their
LINE 43: mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands
LINE 44: cheerfully when she drove away.
LINE 45: Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke
LINE 46: looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him
LINE 47: "Mr. Greatheart" on the spot.
LINE 48: "Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!" whispered Mrs. March,
LINE 49: as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the
LINE 50: carriage.
LINE 51: As she rolled away, the sun came out, and, looking back, she saw it
LINE 52: shining on the group at the gate, like a good omen. They saw it also,
LINE 53: and smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld, as she
LINE 54: turned the corner, was the four bright faces, and behind them, like a
LINE 55: body-guard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.
LINE 56: [Illustration: She rolled away]
LINE 57: "How kind every one is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh proof of
LINE 58: it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.
LINE 59: "I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so
LINE 60: infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling; and so the long
LINE 61: journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful
LINE 62: words.
LINE 63: "I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their neighbors
LINE 64: went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.
LINE 65: "It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg forlornly.
LINE 66: Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile
LINE 67: of nicely-mended hose which lay on mother's table, showing that even in
LINE 68: her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a
LINE 69: little thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and, in spite of
LINE 70: their brave resolutions, they all broke down, and cried bitterly.
LINE 71: Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and, when the
LINE 72: shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a
LINE 73: coffee-pot.
LINE 74: "Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret.
LINE 75: Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work,
LINE 76: and be a credit to the family."
LINE 77: Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that
LINE 78: morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant
LINE 79: invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee-pot. They drew up to the
LINE 80: table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes
LINE 81: were all right again.
LINE 82: "'Hope and keep busy;' that's the motto for us, so let's see who will
LINE 83: remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she
LINE 84: lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.
LINE 85: "I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend
LINE 86: to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red.
LINE 87: "No need of that; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well," put in Amy,
LINE 88: with an important air.
LINE 89: "Hannah will tell us what to do; and we'll have everything nice when you
LINE 90: come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish-tub without delay.
LINE 91: "I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating sugar,
LINE 92: pensively.
LINE 93: The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg
LINE 94: shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a
LINE 95: sugar-bowl.
LINE 96: The sight of the turn-overs made Jo sober again; and when the two went
LINE 97: out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window
LINE 98: where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone; but
LINE 99: Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was,
LINE 100: nodding away at them like a rosy-faced mandarin.
LINE 101: "That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face.
LINE 102: "Good-by, Meggy; I hope the Kings won't train to-day. Don't fret about
LINE 103: father, dear," she added, as they parted.
LINE 104: "And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair _is_ becoming, and it
LINE 105: looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to smile at the
LINE 106: curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.
LINE 107: "That's my only comfort;" and, touching her hat _Ã  la_ Laurie, away went
LINE 108: Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.
LINE 109: News from their father comforted the girls very much; for, though
LINE 110: dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had
LINE 111: already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and, as the
LINE 112: head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the despatches, which grew
LINE 113: more and more cheering as the week passed. At first, every one was eager
LINE 114: to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box
LINE 115: by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their
LINE 116: Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained
LINE 117: characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and
LINE 118: read them:--
LINE 119: "MY DEAREST MOTHER,--
LINE 120: "It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made
LINE 121: us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and
LINE 122: crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate
LINE 123: that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long,
LINE 124: since he is so useful to you and father. The girls are all as
LINE 125: good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing
LINE 126: all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if
LINE 127: I didn't know that her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is
LINE 128: as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what
LINE 129: you told her. She grieves about father, and looks sober except
LINE 130: when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I
LINE 131: take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am
LINE 132: teaching her to make button-holes and mend her stockings. She
LINE 133: tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her
LINE 134: improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a
LINE 135: motherly old hen, as Jo says; and Laurie is very kind and
LINE 136: neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue
LINE 137: sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah
LINE 138: is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and always calls
LINE 139: me Miss 'Margaret,' which is quite proper, you know, and treats
LINE 140: me with respect. We are all well and busy; but we long, day
LINE 141: and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to father,
LINE 142: and believe me, ever your own
LINE 143: "MEG."
LINE 144: This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to
LINE 145: the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,
LINE 146: ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed
LINE 147: letters:--
LINE 148: "MY PRECIOUS MARMEE,--
LINE 149: "Three cheers for dear father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph
LINE 150: right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed
LINE 151: up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for
LINE 152: being so good to us; but I could only cry, and say, 'I'm glad!
LINE 153: I'm glad!' Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? for I
LINE 154: felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and
LINE 155: now I can enjoy them, for every one is so desperately good,
LINE 156: it's like living in a nest of turtle-doves. You'd laugh to see
LINE 157: Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier
LINE 158: every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are
LINE 159: regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be
LINE 160: anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a
LINE 161: quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little
LINE 162: thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I
LINE 163: ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till
LINE 164: I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't, and got mad. It lasted
LINE 165: all day; I felt bad, and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are
LINE 166: both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon; but I thought he'd come
LINE 167: to it, for I _was_ in the right. He didn't come; and just at
LINE 168: night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.
LINE 169: I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun
LINE 170: set on _my_ anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I
LINE 171: met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both
LINE 172: laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and
LINE 173: comfortable again.
LINE 174: "I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and,
LINE 175: as father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse
LINE 176: him. Give him the lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself
LINE 177: a dozen times for your

LINE 179: "A SONG FROM THE SUDS.
LINE 180: "Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,
LINE 181: While the white foam rises high;
LINE 182: And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,
LINE 183: And fasten the clothes to dry;
LINE 184: Then out in the free fresh air they swing,
LINE 185: Under the sunny sky.
LINE 186: "I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls
LINE 187: The stains of the week away,
LINE 188: And let water and air by their magic make
LINE 189: Ourselves as pure as they;
LINE 190: Then on the earth there would be indeed
LINE 191: A glorious washing-day!
LINE 192: "Along the path of a useful life,
LINE 193: Will heart's-ease ever bloom;
LINE 194: The busy mind has no time to think
LINE 195: Of sorrow or care or gloom;
LINE 196: And anxious thoughts may be swept away,
LINE 197: As we bravely wield a broom.
LINE 198: "I am glad a task to me is given,
LINE 199: To labor at day by day;
LINE 200: For it brings me health and strength and hope,
LINE 201: And I cheerfully learn to say,--
LINE 202: 'Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,
LINE 203: But, Hand, you shall work alway!'"
LINE 204: "DEAR MOTHER,--
LINE 205: "There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed
LINE 206: pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for
LINE 207: father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all day,
LINE 208: and sing myself to sleep with father's tune. I can't sing 'Land
LINE 209: of the Leal' now; it makes me cry. Every one is very kind, and
LINE 210: we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of
LINE 211: the page, so I must stop. I didn't forget to cover the holders,
LINE 212: and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.
LINE 213: "Kiss dear father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon
LINE 214: to your loving

LINE 219: the girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words
LINE 220: and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me
LINE 221: and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo
LINE 222: says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as
LINE 223: respeckful as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he
LINE 224: calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me
LINE 225: very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The
LINE 226: sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new
LINE 227: ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than
LINE 228: the dress. I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well
LINE 229: but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and
LINE 230: have buckwheats every day. Can't she? Didn't I make that
LINE 231: interrigation point nice? Meg says my punchtuation and spelling
LINE 232: are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so many
LINE 233: things to do, I can't stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to

LINE 238: "I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is
LINE 239: clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a
LINE 240: proper good housekeeper; she hes the liking for it, and gits
LINE 241: the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin
LINE 242: ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never
LINE 243: know where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of
LINE 244: clothes on Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was
LINE 245: wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should
LINE 246: a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a
LINE 247: sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She
LINE 248: tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her
LINE 249: years; likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful.
LINE 250: We have got on very economical so fur; I don't let the girls
LINE 251: hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em
LINE 252: on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well about frettin, wearin
LINE 253: her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full
LINE 254: of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent;
LINE 255: but he heartens up the girls, and so I let em hev full swing.
LINE 256: The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin,
LINE 257: but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is
LINE 258: riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and
