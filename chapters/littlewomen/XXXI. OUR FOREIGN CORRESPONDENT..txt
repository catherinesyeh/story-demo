LINE 1: "LONDON.
LINE 2: "DEAREST PEOPLE,--
LINE 3: "Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,
LINE 4: Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place, but uncle stopped here
LINE 5: years ago, and won't go anywhere else; however, we don't mean to
LINE 6: stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell
LINE 7: you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits
LINE 8: out of my note-book, for I've done nothing but sketch and
LINE 9: scribble since I started.
LINE 10: "I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but
LINE 11: after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day,
LINE 12: with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Every one was very
LINE 13: kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo; gentlemen
LINE 14: really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait
LINE 15: upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to make
LINE 16: them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I'm
LINE 17: afraid.
LINE 18: [Illustration: "Every one was very kind, especially the
LINE 19: officers."--Page 378.]
LINE 20: "Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let
LINE 21: alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and
LINE 22: enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid
LINE 23: air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast
LINE 24: horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could
LINE 25: have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she
LINE 26: would have gone up and sat on the main-top jib, or whatever the
LINE 27: high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and
LINE 28: tooted on the captain's speaking-trumpet, she'd have been in
LINE 29: such a state of rapture.
LINE 30: "It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and
LINE 31: found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here
LINE 32: and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's
LINE 33: country-seats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It
LINE 34: was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see
LINE 35: it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore _so_
LINE 36: picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.
LINE 37: "At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us,--Mr.
LINE 38: Lennox,--and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,
LINE 39: he sighed and sung, with a look at me,--
LINE 40: 'Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?
LINE 41: She lives on the banks of Killarney;
LINE 42: From the glance of her eye,
LINE 43: Shun danger and fly,
LINE 44: For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.'
LINE 45: Wasn't that nonsensical?
LINE 46: "We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy
LINE 47: place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a
LINE 48: pair of dog-skin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an
LINE 49: umbrella, and got shaved _Ã  la_ mutton-chop, the first thing.
LINE 50: Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton; but
LINE 51: the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little
LINE 52: bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a
LINE 53: grin, 'There yer har, sir. I've give 'em the latest Yankee
LINE 54: shine.' It amused uncle immensely. Oh, I _must_ tell you what
LINE 55: that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with
LINE 56: us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my
LINE 57: room was a lovely one, with 'Robert Lennox's compliments,' on
LINE 58: the card. Wasn't that fun, girls? I like travelling.
LINE 59: "I never _shall_ get to London if I don't hurry. The trip was
LINE 60: like riding through a long picture-gallery, full of lovely
LINE 61: landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight; with thatched roofs,
LINE 62: ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy
LINE 63: children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than
LINE 64: ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a
LINE 65: contented cluck, as if they never got nervous, like Yankee
LINE 66: biddies. Such perfect color I never saw,--the grass so green,
LINE 67: sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark,--I was in a rapture
LINE 68: all the way. So was Flo; and we kept bouncing from one side to
LINE 69: the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along
LINE 70: at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to
LINE 71: sleep, but uncle read his guide-book, and wouldn't be astonished
LINE 72: at anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up,--'Oh,
LINE 73: that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!' Flo,
LINE 74: darting to my window,--'How sweet! We must go there some time,
LINE 75: won't we, papa?' Uncle, calmly admiring his boots,--'No, my
LINE 76: dear, not unless you want beer; that's a brewery.'
LINE 77: "A pause,--then Flo cried out, 'Bless me, there's a gallows and
LINE 78: a man going up.' 'Where, where?' shrieks Amy, staring out at two
LINE 79: tall posts with a cross-beam and some dangling chains. 'A
LINE 80: colliery,' remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. 'Here's a
LINE 81: lovely flock of lambs all lying down,' says Amy. 'See, papa,
LINE 82: aren't they pretty!' added Flo sentimentally. 'Geese, young
LINE 83: ladies,' returns uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo
LINE 84: settles down to enjoy 'The Flirtations of Capt. Cavendish,' and
LINE 85: I have the scenery all to myself.
LINE 86: "Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was
LINE 87: nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked,
LINE 88: and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some
LINE 89: new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.
LINE 90: A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the
LINE 91: loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is
LINE 92: perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap--nice ribbons only
LINE 93: sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in
LINE 94: Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?
LINE 95: "Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while aunt
LINE 96: and uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned
LINE 97: afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in
LINE 98: them alone. It was so droll! for when we were shut in by the
LINE 99: wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and
LINE 100: told me to stop him. But he was up outside behind somewhere, and
LINE 101: I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap
LINE 102: my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling
LINE 103: away, and whirling around corners at a break-neck pace. At last,
LINE 104: in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it
LINE 105: open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said,--
LINE 106: "'Now then, mum?'
LINE 107: "I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the
LINE 108: door, with an 'Aye, aye, mum,' the man made his horse walk, as
LINE 109: if going to a funeral. I poked again, and said, 'A little
LINE 110: faster;' then off he went, helter-skelter, as before, and we
LINE 111: resigned ourselves to our fate.
LINE 112: "To-day was fair and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are
LINE 113: more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives
LINE 114: near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the
LINE 115: Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw,
LINE 116: my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers
LINE 117: rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous
LINE 118: Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and
LINE 119: powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest
LINE 120: children I ever saw; handsome girls, looking half asleep;
LINE 121: dandies, in queer English hats and lavender kids, lounging
LINE 122: about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps
LINE 123: stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.
LINE 124: "Rotten Row means '_Route de Roi_,' or the king's way; but now
LINE 125: it's more like a riding-school than anything else. The horses
LINE 126: are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well; but
LINE 127: the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our
LINE 128: rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they
LINE 129: trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high
LINE 130: hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Every one
LINE 131: rides,--old men, stout ladies, little children,--and the young
LINE 132: folks do a deal of flirting here; I saw a pair exchange
LINE 133: rosebuds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and
LINE 134: I thought it rather a nice little idea.
LINE 135: "In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey; but don't expect me to
LINE 136: describe it, that's impossible--so I'll only say it was sublime!
LINE 137: This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an
LINE 138: appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.
LINE 139: "MIDNIGHT.
LINE 140: "It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning
LINE 141: without telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think
LINE 142: came in, as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and
LINE 143: Frank Vaughn! I was _so_ surprised, for I shouldn't have known
LINE 144: them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows, with whiskers;
LINE 145: Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for
LINE 146: he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard
LINE 147: from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their
LINE 148: house; but uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see
LINE 149: them as we can. They went to the theatre with us, and we did
LINE 150: have _such_ a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and
LINE 151: Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we
LINE 152: had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for
LINE 153: her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when
LINE 154: I spoke of Jo, and sent his 'respectful compliments to the big
LINE 155: hat.' Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we
LINE 156: had there. What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?
LINE 157: "Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I _must_
LINE 158: stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing
LINE 159: here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a
LINE 160: jumble of parks, theatres, new gowns, and gallant creatures who
LINE 161: say 'Ah!' and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English
LINE 162: lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense
LINE 163: am, as ever, your loving
LINE 164: AMY."
LINE 165: "DEAR GIRLS,-- "PARIS.
LINE 166: "In my last I told you about our London visit,--how kind the
LINE 167: Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I
LINE 168: enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum
LINE 169: more than anything else,--for at Hampton I saw Raphael's
LINE 170: cartoons, and, at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner,
LINE 171: Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The
LINE 172: day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English
LINE 173: picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I
LINE 174: could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We
LINE 175: 'did' London to our hearts' content, thanks to Fred and Frank,
LINE 176: and were sorry to go away; for, though English people are slow
LINE 177: to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they
LINE 178: cannot be outdone in hospitality, _I_ think. The Vaughns hope to
LINE 179: meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully
LINE 180: disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I are great friends,
LINE 181: and the boys very nice fellows,--especially Fred.
LINE 182: "Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again,
LINE 183: saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland.
LINE 184: Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she
LINE 185: couldn't say a word; and now we get on nicely, and are very glad
LINE 186: he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't know
LINE 187: what we should do without him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and
LINE 188: insists on talking English very loud, as if that would make
LINE 189: people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned,
LINE 190: and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good
LINE 191: deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do the
LINE 192: '_parley vooing_,' as uncle calls it.
LINE 193: "Such delightful times as we are having! sight-seeing from
LINE 194: morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay
LINE 195: _cafÃ©s_, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy
LINE 196: days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn
LINE 197: up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no
LINE 198: soul for art; but _I_ have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as
LINE 199: fast as I can. She would like the relics of great people better,
LINE 200: for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat, his
LINE 201: baby's cradle and his old toothbrush; also Marie Antoinette's
LINE 202: little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword, and
LINE 203: many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about them
LINE 204: when I come, but haven't time to write.
LINE 205: "The Palais Royale is a heavenly place,--so full of _bijouterie_
LINE 206: and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy
LINE 207: them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow
LINE 208: it. Then the Bois and the Champs ElysÃ©es are _trÃ¨s magnifique_.
LINE 209: I've seen the imperial family several times,--the emperor an
LINE 210: ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed
LINE 211: in bad taste, _I_ thought,--purple dress, green hat, and yellow
LINE 212: gloves. Little Nap. is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his
LINE 213: tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his
LINE 214: four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets, and a
LINE 215: mounted guard before and behind.
LINE 216: [Illustration: I've seen the imperial family several times]
LINE 217: "We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely,
LINE 218: though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. PÃ¨re la
LINE 219: Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small
LINE 220: rooms, and, looking in, one sees a table, with images or
LINE 221: pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in
LINE 222: when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.
LINE 223: "Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and, sitting in the
LINE 224: balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It is
LINE 225: so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there, when too
LINE 226: tired with our day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining,
LINE 227: and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever
LINE 228: knew,--except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish
LINE 229: Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men; however, the Vaughns
LINE 230: are very rich, and come of an excellent family, so I won't find
LINE 231: fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.
LINE 232: "Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland; and, as we
LINE 233: shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty
LINE 234: letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember correctly and
LINE 235: describe clearly all that I see and admire,' as father advised.
LINE 236: It is good practice for me, and, with my sketch-book, will give
LINE 237: you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.
LINE 238: "Adieu; I embrace you tenderly. VOTRE AMIE."
LINE 239: "MY DEAR MAMMA,-- "HEIDELBERG.
LINE 240: "Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell
LINE 241: you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you
LINE 242: will see.
LINE 243: "The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed
LINE 244: it with all my might. Get father's old guide-books, and read
LINE 245: about it; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At
LINE 246: Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with
LINE 247: whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was
LINE 248: a moonlight night, and, about one o'clock, Flo and I were waked
LINE 249: by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and
LINE 250: hid behind the curtains; but sly peeps showed us Fred and the
LINE 251: students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing
LINE 252: I ever saw,--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress
LINE 253: opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of
LINE 254: stone.
LINE 255: "When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them
LINE 256: scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and
LINE 257: go laughing away,--to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next
LINE 258: morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his
LINE 259: vest-pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and
LINE 260: said I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him,
LINE 261: for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.
LINE 262: I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to
LINE 263: look like it.
LINE 264: "The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where
LINE 265: Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He needs some one to
LINE 266: look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she
LINE 267: hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would
LINE 268: be well for him. Frankfort was delightful; I saw Goethe's house,
LINE 269: Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous 'Ariadne.' It was very
LINE 270: lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the
LINE 271: story better. I didn't like to ask, as every one knew it, or
LINE 272: pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it; I
LINE 273: ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything, and
LINE 274: it mortifies me.
LINE 275: "Now comes the serious part,--for it happened here, and Fred is
LINE 276: just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite
LINE 277: fond of him; I never thought of anything but a travelling
LINE 278: friendship, till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to
LINE 279: feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily
LINE 280: adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't
LINE 281: flirted, mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and
LINE 282: have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I
LINE 283: don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for
LINE 284: them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know mother
LINE 285: will shake her head, and the girls say, 'Oh, the mercenary
LINE 286: little wretch!' but I've made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me,
LINE 287: I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him,
LINE 288: and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young,
LINE 289: clever enough, and very rich,--ever so much richer than the
LINE 290: Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should
LINE 291: be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous
LINE 292: people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have
LINE 293: the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city
LINE 294: house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses,
LINE 295: but twice as comfortable, and full of solid luxury, such as
LINE 296: English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've
LINE 297: seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and
LINE 298: pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,
LINE 299: lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should
LINE 300: ask! and I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up
LINE 301: so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I
LINE 302: hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I
LINE 303: can help. One of us _must_ marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't,
LINE 304: Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything cosey all round.
LINE 305: I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of
LINE 306: that; and, though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well,
LINE 307: and, in time, I should get fond enough of him if he was very
LINE 308: fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning
LINE 309: the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible
LINE 310: to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little
LINE 311: things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side
LINE 312: of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we
LINE 313: are alone, and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to
LINE 314: me. Yesterday, at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us,
LINE 315: and then said something to his friend,--a rakish-looking
LINE 316: baron,--about '_ein wonderschÃ¶nes BlÃ¶ndchen_,' Fred looked as
LINE 317: fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely, it nearly flew
LINE 318: off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but
LINE 319: is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might
LINE 320: guess from his bonnie blue eyes.
LINE 321: "Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset,--at
LINE 322: least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there, after going
LINE 323: to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking
LINE 324: about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the
LINE 325: beautiful gardens made by the elector, long ago, for his English
LINE 326: wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine;
LINE 327: so, while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there
LINE 328: trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with
LINE 329: scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got
LINE 330: into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling
LINE 331: through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band
LINE 332: below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I
LINE 333: had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was
LINE 334: ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool,
LINE 335: and only a little excited.
LINE 336: [Illustration: Trying to sketch the gray-stone lion's head on the wall]
LINE 337: "By and by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying
LINE 338: through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I
LINE 339: forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said
LINE 340: he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was
LINE 341: very ill; so he was going at once, in the night train, and only
LINE 342: had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and
LINE 343: disappointed for myself, but only for a minute, because he
LINE 344: said, as he shook hands,--and said it in a way that I could not
LINE 345: mistake,--'I shall soon come back; you won't forget me, Amy?'
LINE 346: "I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied,
LINE 347: and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes,
LINE 348: for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know
LINE 349: he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted,
LINE 350: that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort
LINE 351: yet awhile, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a
LINE 352: foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome; and then,
LINE 353: if I don't change my mind, I'll say 'Yes, thank you,' when he
LINE 354: says 'Will you, please?'
LINE 355: "Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know
LINE 356: what was going on. Don't be anxious about me; remember I am your
LINE 357: 'prudent Amy,' and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as
LINE 358: much advice as you like; I'll use it if I can. I wish I could
LINE 359: see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust me.
LINE 360: "Ever your AMY."
