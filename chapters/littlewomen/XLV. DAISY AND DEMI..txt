LINE 1: I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March
LINE 2: family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious
LINE 3: and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of
LINE 4: discretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their
LINE 5: rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do.
LINE 6: If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by
LINE 7: adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most
LINE 8: remarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they
LINE 9: walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two
LINE 10: years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety
LINE 11: which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a "needler," and
LINE 12: actually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up
LINE 13: housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking-stove
LINE 14: with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi
LINE 15: learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of
LINE 16: teaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs,
LINE 17: thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a
LINE 18: mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother,
LINE 19: for he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a
LINE 20: chaotic condition, with his "sewin-sheen,"--a mysterious structure of
LINE 21: string, chairs, clothes-pins, and spools, for wheels to go "wound and
LINE 22: wound;" also a basket hung over the back of a big chair, in which he
LINE 23: vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine
LINE 24: devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the
LINE 25: young inventor indignantly remarked, "Why, marmar, dat's my lellywaiter,
LINE 26: and me's trying to pull her up."
LINE 27: Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well
LINE 28: together, and seldom quarrelled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi
LINE 29: tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other
LINE 30: aggressor; while Daisy made a galley-slave of herself, and adored her
LINE 31: brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny
LINE 32: little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and
LINE 33: nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be
LINE 34: kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and
LINE 35: produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small
LINE 36: virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few
LINE 37: small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair
LINE 38: weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window
LINE 39: in her little night-gown to look out, and say, no matter whether it
LINE 40: rained or shone, "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Every one was a friend,
LINE 41: and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most
LINE 42: inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful
LINE 43: worshippers.
LINE 44: [Illustration: Me loves evvybody]
LINE 45: "Me loves evvybody," she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in
LINE 46: one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish
LINE 47: the whole world.
LINE 48: As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest
LINE 49: by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had
LINE 50: helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared
LINE 51: a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had
LINE 52: entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her "Beth,"
LINE 53: and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if
LINE 54: trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could
LINE 55: see.
LINE 56: Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know
LINE 57: everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get
LINE 58: satisfactory answers to his perpetual "What for?"
LINE 59: He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his
LINE 60: grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which
LINE 61: the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised
LINE 62: satisfaction of the womenfolk.
LINE 63: [Illustration: What makes my legs go, dranpa?]
LINE 64: "What makes my legs go, dranpa?" asked the young philosopher, surveying
LINE 65: those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting
LINE 66: after a go-to-bed frolic one night.
LINE 67: "It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the yellow
LINE 68: head respectfully.
LINE 69: "What is a little mine?"
LINE 70: "It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the
LINE 71: wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."
LINE 72: "Open me; I want to see it go wound."
LINE 73: "I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you
LINE 74: up, and you go till He stops you."
LINE 75: "Does I?" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the
LINE 76: new thought. "Is I wounded up like the watch?"
LINE 77: "Yes; but I can't show you how; for it is done when we don't see."
LINE 78: Demi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the
LINE 79: watch, and then gravely remarked,--
LINE 80: "I dess Dod does it when I's asleep."
LINE 81: A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that
LINE 82: his anxious grandmother said,--
LINE 83: "My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby?
LINE 84: He's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most
LINE 85: unanswerable questions."
LINE 86: "If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive
LINE 87: true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping
LINE 88: him unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,
LINE 89: and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.
LINE 90: Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind?"
LINE 91: If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, "By the gods, Socrates, I cannot
LINE 92: tell," his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after
LINE 93: standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he
LINE 94: answered, in a tone of calm conviction, "In my little belly," the old
LINE 95: gentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in
LINE 96: metaphysics.
LINE 97: There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given
LINE 98: convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding
LINE 99: philosopher; for, often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to
LINE 100: prophesy, with ominous nods, "That child ain't long for this world," he
LINE 101: would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with
LINE 102: which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their
LINE 103: parents' souls.
LINE 104: Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them; but what mother was
LINE 105: ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the
LINE 106: tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show
LINE 107: themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?
LINE 108: "No more raisins, Demi, they'll make you sick," says mamma to the young
LINE 109: person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity
LINE 110: on plum-pudding day.
LINE 111: "Me likes to be sick."
LINE 112: "I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty-cakes."
LINE 113: He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit; and, by
LINE 114: and by, when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits mamma by a
LINE 115: shrewd bargain.
LINE 116: "Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like," says
LINE 117: Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is
LINE 118: safely bouncing in the pot.
LINE 119: "Truly, marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered
LINE 120: head.
LINE 121: "Yes, truly; anything you say," replies the short-sighted parent,
LINE 122: preparing herself to sing "The Three Little Kittens" half a dozen times
LINE 123: over, or to take her family to "Buy a penny bun," regardless of wind or
LINE 124: limb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply,--
LINE 125: "Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."
LINE 126: Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and _confidante_ of both children, and the
LINE 127: trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a
LINE 128: name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but
LINE 129: Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which
LINE 130: compliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo
LINE 131: neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their
LINE 132: little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost
LINE 133: her best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration,
LINE 134: soon discovered that Dodo liked to play with "the bear-man" better than
LINE 135: she did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he
LINE 136: hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate-drops in
LINE 137: his waistcoat-pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case
LINE 138: and freely shaken by ardent admirers.
LINE 139: Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;
LINE 140: but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the
LINE 141: "bear-man" with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small
LINE 142: affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her
LINE 143: throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.
LINE 144: Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the
LINE 145: young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this
LINE 146: counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not
LINE 147: deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however
LINE 148: likewise effective,--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law;
LINE 149: he was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked
LINE 150: particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his
LINE 151: manly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day,
LINE 152: but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked
LINE 153: for Mr. March, so I suppose _he_ was the attraction. The excellent papa
LINE 154: labored under the delusion that he was, and revelled in long discussions
LINE 155: with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing
LINE 156: grandson suddenly enlightened him.
LINE 157: Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,
LINE 158: astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay
LINE 159: Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,
LINE 160: likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own
LINE 161: short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovellers so seriously absorbed
LINE 162: that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his
LINE 163: sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face,--
LINE 164: "Father, father, here's the Professor!"
LINE 165: Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor
LINE 166: said, with undisturbed dignity,--
LINE 167: "Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing
LINE 168: our lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name."
LINE 169: "I knows him!" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took
LINE 170: the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly
LINE 171: shouted, "It's a We, dranpa, it's a We!"
LINE 172: [Illustration: Dranpa, it's a We]
LINE 173: "He's a born Weller," laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and
LINE 174: her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing
LINE 175: his satisfaction that school was over.
LINE 176: "What have you been at to-day, bübchen?" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the
LINE 177: gymnast.
LINE 178: "Me went to see little Mary."
LINE 179: "And what did you there?"
LINE 180: "I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.
LINE 181: "Prut! thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?"
LINE 182: asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon
LINE 183: his knee, exploring the waistcoat-pocket.
LINE 184: "Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. _Don't_ little
LINE 185: boys like little girls?" added Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of
LINE 186: bland satisfaction.
LINE 187: "You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?" said Jo, enjoying
LINE 188: the innocent revelations as much as the Professor.
LINE 189: "'Tisn't in mine head; it's in mine mouf," answered literal Demi,
LINE 190: putting out his tongue, with a chocolate-drop on it, thinking she
LINE 191: alluded to confectionery, not ideas.
LINE 192: "Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet,
LINE 193: mannling;" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her
LINE 194: wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw
LINE 195: the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired,--
LINE 196: "Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor?"
LINE 197: Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer "couldn't tell a lie;" so he gave the
LINE 198: somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that
LINE 199: made Mr. March put down his clothes-brush, glance at Jo's retiring face,
LINE 200: and then sink into his chair, looking as if the "precocious chick" had
LINE 201: put an idea into _his_ head that was both sweet and sour.
LINE 202: Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour
LINE 203: afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a
LINE 204: tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she
LINE 205: followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice
LINE 206: of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled
LINE 207: his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.
