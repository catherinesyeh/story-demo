LINE 1: While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at
LINE 2: Aunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her
LINE 3: life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March
LINE 4: never petted any one; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be
LINE 5: kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt
LINE 6: March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,
LINE 7: though she didn't think proper to confess it. She really did her best to
LINE 8: make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people
LINE 9: keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize
LINE 10: with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can
LINE 11: hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship
LINE 12: in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried
LINE 13: Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy
LINE 14: talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the
LINE 15: old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the
LINE 16: bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and
LINE 17: taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,--a process
LINE 18: which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the
LINE 19: web of a very strict spider.
LINE 20: [Illustration: Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot]
LINE 21: She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned
LINE 22: spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses, till they shone. Then
LINE 23: she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck
LINE 24: escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs, and much
LINE 25: carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the
LINE 26: lap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, or
LINE 27: deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big
LINE 28: chair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a
LINE 29: daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour
LINE 30: for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie came every day,
LINE 31: and wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when
LINE 32: they walked and rode, and had capital times. After dinner, she had to
LINE 33: read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually
LINE 34: did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork
LINE 35: or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward
LINE 36: rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked
LINE 37: till tea-time. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell
LINE 38: to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull
LINE 39: that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard
LINE 40: fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a
LINE 41: tear or two.
LINE 42: If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that
LINE 43: she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone
LINE 44: was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not
LINE 45: admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He
LINE 46: pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to
LINE 47: plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking
LINE 48: at him while Madam dozed; called her names before company, and behaved
LINE 49: in all respects like a reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure
LINE 50: the dog,--a fat, cross beast, who snarled and yelped at her when she
LINE 51: made his toilet, and who lay on his back, with all his legs in the air
LINE 52: and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to
LINE 53: eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the
LINE 54: old coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of
LINE 55: the young lady.
LINE 56: [Illustration: On his back, with all his legs in the air]
LINE 57: Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with "Madame," as she called her
LINE 58: mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
LINE 59: who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but
LINE 60: Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that
LINE 61: she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to
LINE 62: Mademoiselle, and amused her very much, with odd stories of her life in
LINE 63: France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. She also
LINE 64: allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and
LINE 65: pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests;
LINE 66: for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian
LINE 67: cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeon-holes, and secret places,
LINE 68: in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely
LINE 69: curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things
LINE 70: gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on
LINE 71: velvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty
LINE 72: years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came
LINE 73: out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding-day, her lover's
LINE 74: diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with
LINE 75: portraits of dead friends, and weeping willows made of hair inside; the
LINE 76: baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn; Uncle March's big
LINE 77: watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in
LINE 78: a box, all by itself, lay Aunt March's wedding-ring, too small now for
LINE 79: her fat finger, but put carefully away, like the most precious jewel of
LINE 80: them all.
LINE 81: [Illustration: I should choose this]
LINE 82: "Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?" asked Esther, who
LINE 83: always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.
LINE 84: "I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm
LINE 85: fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I
LINE 86: might," replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold
LINE 87: and ebony beads, from which hung a heavy cross of the same.
LINE 88: "I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! to me it is a
LINE 89: rosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic," said Esther,
LINE 90: eying the handsome thing wistfully.
LINE 91: "Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads
LINE 92: hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.
LINE 93: "Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one
LINE 94: used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou."
LINE 95: "You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and
LINE 96: always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could."
LINE 97: "If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but, as
LINE 98: that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day, to
LINE 99: meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame.
LINE 100: She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble."
LINE 101: "Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who, in her
LINE 102: loneliness, felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was
LINE 103: apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her
LINE 104: of it.
LINE 105: "It would be excellent and charming; and I shall gladly arrange the
LINE 106: little dressing-room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but
LINE 107: when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and
LINE 108: pray the dear God to preserve your sister."
LINE 109: Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an
LINE 110: affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy
LINE 111: liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her
LINE 112: room, hoping it would do her good.
LINE 113: "I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March
LINE 114: dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary, and shut the
LINE 115: jewel-cases one by one.
LINE 116: "To you and your sisters. I know it; Madame confides in me; I witnessed
LINE 117: her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther, smiling.
LINE 118: "How nice! but I wish she'd let us have them now. Pro-cras-ti-nation is
LINE 119: not agreeable," observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.
LINE 120: "It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first
LINE 121: one who is affianced will have the pearls--Madame has said it; and I
LINE 122: have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when
LINE 123: you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners."
LINE 124: "Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely
LINE 125: ring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt
LINE 126: March, after all;" and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face,
LINE 127: and a firm resolve to earn it.
LINE 128: From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady
LINE 129: complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the
LINE 130: closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a
LINE 131: picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no
LINE 132: great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that
LINE 133: Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very
LINE 134: valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's
LINE 135: beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of
LINE 136: the divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her
LINE 137: heart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymn-book, kept a
LINE 138: vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every
LINE 139: day to "sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to
LINE 140: preserve her sister." Esther had given her a rosary of black beads, with
LINE 141: a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful
LINE 142: as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.
LINE 143: The little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone
LINE 144: outside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold
LINE 145: by so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender
LINE 146: Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children.
LINE 147: She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having
LINE 148: been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in
LINE 149: it confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden
LINE 150: seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be
LINE 151: satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In
LINE 152: her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,
LINE 153: as Aunt March had done; so that if she _did_ fall ill and die, her
LINE 154: possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang
LINE 155: even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were
LINE 156: as precious as the old lady's jewels.
LINE 157: During one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as
LINE 158: well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms,
LINE 159: and, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt
LINE 160: relieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second
LINE 161: witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in
LINE 162: one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this
LINE 163: room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which
LINE 164: Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array
LINE 165: herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long
LINE 166: mirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a
LINE 167: rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she
LINE 168: did not hear Laurie's ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she
LINE 169: gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on
LINE 170: which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue
LINE 171: brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk
LINE 172: carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo
LINE 173: afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay
LINE 174: suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as
LINE 175: well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, "Ain't
LINE 176: we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha!
LINE 177: ha!"
LINE 178: [Illustration: Gravely promenaded to and fro]
LINE 179: Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it
LINE 180: should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received.
LINE 181: "Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult
LINE 182: you about a very serious matter," said Amy, when she had shown her
LINE 183: splendor, and driven Polly into a corner. "That bird is the trial of my
LINE 184: life," she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while
LINE 185: Laurie seated himself astride of a chair. "Yesterday, when aunt was
LINE 186: asleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to
LINE 187: squall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a
LINE 188: big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly
LINE 189: marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase,
LINE 190: saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a
LINE 191: walk, my dear.' I _couldn't_ help laughing, which made Poll swear, and
LINE 192: aunt woke up and scolded us both."
LINE 193: "Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?" asked Laurie,
LINE 194: yawning.
LINE 195: "Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and
LINE 196: scrambled up on aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! catch her! catch
LINE 197: her!' as I chased the spider.
LINE 198: "That's a lie! Oh lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.
LINE 199: "I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried Laurie,
LINE 200: shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely
LINE 201: croaked, "Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!"
LINE 202: "Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out
LINE 203: of her pocket. "I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is
LINE 204: legal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and
LINE 205: I don't want any ill-feeling over my tomb."
LINE 206: [Illustration: Amy's Will]
LINE 207: Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read
LINE 208: the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the
LINE 209: spelling:--
LINE 210: "MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.
LINE 211: "I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and
LINE 212: bequeethe all my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely
LINE 213: "To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of
LINE 214: art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.
LINE 215: "To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with
LINE 216: pockets,--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.
LINE 217: "To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get
LINE 218: it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of
LINE 219: real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of
LINE 220: her 'little girl.'
LINE 221: "To Jo I leave my breast-pin, the one mended with sealing wax,
LINE 222: also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most
LINE 223: precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burnt up her
LINE 224: story.
LINE 225: "To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little
LINE 226: bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can
LINE 227: wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also
LINE 228: leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.
LINE 229: "To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my
LINE 230: paper marshay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did
LINE 231: say it hadn't any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in
LINE 232: the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes,
LINE 233: Noter Dame is the best.
LINE 234: "To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box
LINE 235: with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his
LINE 236: pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his
LINE 237: favors to her family, specially Beth.
LINE 238: "I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk
LINE 239: apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.
LINE 240: "To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patch work
LINE 241: I leave hoping she 'will remember me, when it you see.'
LINE 242: "And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all
LINE 243: will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive every one,
LINE 244: and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.
LINE 245: "To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th
LINE 246: day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.
LINE 247: "AMY CURTIS MARCH.
LINE 248: {ESTELLE VALNOR,
LINE 249: "_Witnesses_: {
LINE 250: {THEODORE LAURENCE."
LINE 251: The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to
LINE 252: rewrite it in ink, and seal it up for her properly.
LINE 253: "What put it into your head? Did any one tell you about Beth's giving
LINE 254: away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,
LINE 255: with sealing-wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
LINE 256: She explained; and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"
LINE 257: "I'm sorry I spoke; but as I did, I'll tell you. She felt so ill one day
LINE 258: that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you,
LINE 259: and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was
LINE 260: sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of
LINE 261: us, and her best love to grandpa. _She_ never thought of a will."
LINE 262: Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a
LINE 263: great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of trouble; but she
LINE 264: only said, "Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,
LINE 265: sometimes?"
LINE 266: "Yes; 'codicils,' they call them."
LINE 267: "Put one in mine then--that I wish _all_ my curls cut off, and given
LINE 268: round to my friends. I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will
LINE 269: spoil my looks."
LINE 270: Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he
LINE 271: amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But
LINE 272: when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips,
LINE 273: "Is there really any danger about Beth?"
LINE 274: "I'm afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,
LINE 275: dear;" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which
LINE 276: was very comforting.
LINE 277: When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and, sitting in the
LINE 278: twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,
LINE 279: feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the
LINE 280: loss of her gentle little sister.
