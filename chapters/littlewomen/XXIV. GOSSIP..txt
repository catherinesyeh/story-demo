LINE 1: In order that we may start afresh, and go to Meg's wedding with free
LINE 2: minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.
LINE 3: And here let me premise, that if any of the elders think there is too
LINE 4: much "lovering" in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the
LINE 5: young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,
LINE 6: "What _can_ you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a
LINE 7: dashing young neighbor over the way?"
LINE 8: The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the
LINE 9: quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with
LINE 10: his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature
LINE 11: as by grace,--a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better
LINE 12: than learning, the charity which calls all mankind "brother," the piety
LINE 13: that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.
LINE 14: These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which
LINE 15: shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many
LINE 16: admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as
LINE 17: naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard
LINE 18: experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the
LINE 19: gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled
LINE 20: women instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him, sure of
LINE 21: finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their
LINE 22: sins to the pure-hearted old man, and were both rebuked and saved;
LINE 23: gifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of
LINE 24: nobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his
LINE 25: beliefs were beautiful and true, although "they wouldn't pay."
LINE 26: To outsiders, the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so
LINE 27: they did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books,
LINE 28: was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and
LINE 29: comforter; for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous
LINE 30: times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband
LINE 31: and father.
LINE 32: The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls
LINE 33: into their father's; and to both parents, who lived and labored so
LINE 34: faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth, and
LINE 35: bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and
LINE 36: outlives death.
LINE 37: Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we
LINE 38: saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the
LINE 39: hospitals and homes, still full of wounded "boys" and soldiers' widows,
LINE 40: decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.
LINE 41: John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent
LINE 42: home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he
LINE 43: deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love
LINE 44: are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his
LINE 45: discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business,
LINE 46: and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence
LINE 47: that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers,
LINE 48: and accepted the place of book-keeper feeling better satisfied to begin
LINE 49: with an honestly-earned salary, than by running any risks with borrowed
LINE 50: money.
LINE 51: Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in
LINE 52: character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever; for love is
LINE 53: a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt
LINE 54: some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.
LINE 55: Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help
LINE 56: contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid
LINE 57: outfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But
LINE 58: somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the
LINE 59: patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her;
LINE 60: and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small
LINE 61: plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot
LINE 62: Sallie's splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in
LINE 63: Christendom.
LINE 64: Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to
LINE 65: Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of
LINE 66: the best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would
LINE 67: have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her
LINE 68: afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted
LINE 69: herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the
LINE 70: fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again
LINE 71: the rosy, healthy creature she had been; yet always hopeful, happy, and
LINE 72: serene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, every one's friend, and an
LINE 73: angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to
LINE 74: know it.
LINE 75: As long as "The Spread Eagle" paid her a dollar a column for her
LINE 76: "rubbish," as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun
LINE 77: her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy
LINE 78: brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a
LINE 79: slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place
LINE 80: the name of March upon the roll of fame.
LINE 81: Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was
LINE 82: now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please
LINE 83: himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,
LINE 84: and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to
LINE 85: get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoilt,
LINE 86: and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had
LINE 87: not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man
LINE 88: who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over
LINE 89: him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the
LINE 90: knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him
LINE 91: with all their hearts.
LINE 92: Being only "a glorious human boy," of course he frolicked and flirted,
LINE 93: grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions
LINE 94: ordained; hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came
LINE 95: perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the
LINE 96: love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save
LINE 97: himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible
LINE 98: power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather
LINE 99: prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with
LINE 100: graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified
LINE 101: professors, and vanquished enemies. The "men of my class" were heroes in
LINE 102: the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of "our
LINE 103: fellows," and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these
LINE 104: great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.
LINE 105: Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among
LINE 106: them; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of
LINE 107: fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her
LINE 108: private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and
LINE 109: Beth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to
LINE 110: order them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very
LINE 111: difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases,
LINE 112: and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed
LINE 113: for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love
LINE 114: with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a
LINE 115: sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment
LINE 116: brings us very naturally to the "Dove-cote."
LINE 117: That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had
LINE 118: prepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was
LINE 119: highly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who "went on together like a
LINE 120: pair of turtle-doves, with first a bill and then a coo." It was a tiny
LINE 121: house, with a little garden behind, and a lawn about as big as a
LINE 122: pocket-handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,
LINE 123: shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present,
LINE 124: the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a
LINE 125: dilapidated slop-bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,
LINE 126: undecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was
LINE 127: merely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted.
LINE 128: But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault
LINE 129: from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was
LINE 130: fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in
LINE 131: whole; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit;
LINE 132: and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of
LINE 133: precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal-bin. But
LINE 134: once get used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more
LINE 135: complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the
LINE 136: furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no
LINE 137: marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little
LINE 138: parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a
LINE 139: stand of flowers in the bay-window, and, scattered all about, the pretty
LINE 140: gifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving
LINE 141: messages they brought.
LINE 142: I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty
LINE 143: because John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer
LINE 144: could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's
LINE 145: artistic hand; or that any store-room was ever better provided with good
LINE 146: wishes, merry words, and happy hopes, than that in which Jo and her
LINE 147: mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally
LINE 148: certain that the spandy-new kitchen never _could_ have looked so cosey
LINE 149: and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times
LINE 150: over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute "Mis. Brooke
LINE 151: came home." I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so
LINE 152: rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece-bags; for Beth made enough
LINE 153: to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three
LINE 154: different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal
LINE 155: china.
LINE 156: People who hire all these things done for them never know what they
LINE 157: lose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,
LINE 158: and Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest,
LINE 159: from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was
LINE 160: eloquent of home love and tender forethought.
LINE 161: What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping
LINE 162: excursions; what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter
LINE 163: arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this
LINE 164: young gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as
LINE 165: ever. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits,
LINE 166: some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a
LINE 167: bag of remarkable clothes-pins; next, a wonderful nutmeg-grater, which
LINE 168: fell to pieces at the first trial; a knife-cleaner that spoilt all the
LINE 169: knives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left
LINE 170: the dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands;
LINE 171: infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the
LINE 172: deluded buyer; and every kind of tin-ware, from a toy savings-bank for
LINE 173: odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own
LINE 174: steam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.
LINE 175: In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him
LINE 176: "Mr. Toodles." He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee
LINE 177: ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week
LINE 178: beheld some fresh absurdity.
LINE 179: Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored
LINE 180: soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table
LINE 181: for the first meal.
LINE 182: "Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you
LINE 183: should be happy here?" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went
LINE 184: through the new kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then they seemed to cling
LINE 185: together more tenderly than ever.
LINE 186: "Yes, mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and _so_ happy
LINE 187: that I can't talk about it," answered Meg, with a look that was better
LINE 188: than words.
LINE 189: "If she only had a servant or two it would be all right," said Amy,
LINE 190: coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether
LINE 191: the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantle-piece.
LINE 192: "Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try
LINE 193: her way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my
LINE 194: errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to
LINE 195: keep me from getting lazy or homesick," answered Meg tranquilly.
LINE 196: "Sallie Moffat has four," began Amy.
LINE 197: "If Meg had four the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis
LINE 198: would have to camp in the garden," broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big
LINE 199: blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door-handles.
LINE 200: "Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her
LINE 201: fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that
LINE 202: there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big
LINE 203: one. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves
LINE 204: nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first
LINE 205: married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so
LINE 206: that I might have the pleasure of mending them; for I got heartily sick
LINE 207: of doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief."
LINE 208: "Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she
LINE 209: does, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the
LINE 210: servants laugh at her," said Meg.
LINE 211: "I did, after a while; not to 'mess,' but to learn of Hannah how things
LINE 212: should be done, that my servants need _not_ laugh at me. It was play
LINE 213: then; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only
LINE 214: possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little
LINE 215: girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You
LINE 216: begin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be
LINE 217: of use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of
LINE 218: a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she
LINE 219: wishes to be well and honestly served."
LINE 220: "Yes, mother, I'm sure of that," said Meg, listening respectfully to the
LINE 221: little lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the
LINE 222: all-absorbing subject of housekeeping. "Do you know I like this room
LINE 223: most of all in my baby-house," added Meg, a minute after, as they went
LINE 224: upstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen-closet.
LINE 225: Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves, and
LINE 226: exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke; for that
LINE 227: linen-closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married "that
LINE 228: Brooke" she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in
LINE 229: a quandary, when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her
LINE 230: vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to
LINE 231: get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy
LINE 232: herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made,
LINE 233: and marked, a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as
LINE 234: _her_ present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked
LINE 235: out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family; for Aunt March tried to look
LINE 236: utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the
LINE 237: old-fashioned pearls, long promised to the first bride.
LINE 238: "That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend
LINE 239: who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for
LINE 240: company, and that satisfied her," said Mrs. March, patting the damask
LINE 241: table-cloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.
LINE 242: "I haven't a single finger-bowl, but this is a 'set out' that will last
LINE 243: me all my days, Hannah says;" and Meg looked quite contented, as well
LINE 244: she might.
LINE 245: "Toodles is coming," cried Jo from below; and they all went down to meet
LINE 246: Laurie, whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives.
LINE 247: A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt-basin
LINE 248: of a hat, and a fly-away coat, came tramping down the road at a great
LINE 249: pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate,
LINE 250: straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out, and a hearty--
LINE 251: "Here I am, mother! Yes, it's all right."
LINE 252: The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him; a
LINE 253: kindly questioning look, which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the
LINE 254: little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.
LINE 255: "For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments.
LINE 256: Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are
LINE 257: getting altogether too handsome for a single lady."
LINE 258: As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's
LINE 259: hair-ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of
LINE 260: mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and every one began
LINE 261: to talk.
LINE 262: "Where is John?" asked Meg anxiously.
LINE 263: "Stopped to get the license for to-morrow, ma'am."
LINE 264: "Which side won the last match, Teddy?" inquired Jo, who persisted in
LINE 265: feeling an interest in manly sports, despite her nineteen years.
LINE 266: "Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see."
LINE 267: "How is the lovely Miss Randal?" asked Amy, with a significant smile.
LINE 268: "More cruel than ever; don't you see how I'm pining away?" and Laurie
LINE 269: gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.
LINE 270: "What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg," said Beth, eying
LINE 271: the knobby parcel with curiosity.
LINE 272: "It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,"
LINE 273: observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of
LINE 274: the girls.
LINE 275: [Illustration: A small watchman's rattle]
LINE 276: "Any time when John is away, and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just
LINE 277: swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood
LINE 278: in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?" and Laurie gave them a sample of its
LINE 279: powers that made them cover up their ears.
LINE 280: "There's gratitude for you! and speaking of gratitude reminds me to
LINE 281: mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding-cake from
LINE 282: destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she
LINE 283: hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked
LINE 284: like a remarkably plummy one."
LINE 285: "I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie," said Meg, in a matronly
LINE 286: tone.
LINE 287: "I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six
LINE 288: feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days," responded the
LINE 289: young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.
LINE 290: "I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and
LINE 291: span new bower, so, as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an
LINE 292: adjournment," he added presently.
LINE 293: "Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to
LINE 294: settle," said Meg, bustling away.
LINE 295: "Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for
LINE 296: to-morrow," added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque
LINE 297: curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.
LINE 298: "Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I
LINE 299: can't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do;
LINE 300: it's peculiarly becoming," said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial
LINE 301: aversion in her capacious pocket, and offered him her arm to support his
LINE 302: feeble steps.
LINE 303: "Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about to-morrow," began Jo,
LINE 304: as they strolled away together. "You _must_ promise to behave well, and
LINE 305: not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."
LINE 306: "Not a prank."
LINE 307: "And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."
LINE 308: "I never do; you are the one for that."
LINE 309: "And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony; I shall
LINE 310: certainly laugh if you do."
LINE 311: "You won't see me; you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you
LINE 312: will obscure the prospect."
LINE 313: "I never cry unless for some great affliction."
LINE 314: "Such as fellows going to college, hey?" cut in Laurie, with a
LINE 315: suggestive laugh.
LINE 316: "Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company."
LINE 317: "Exactly. I say, Jo, how is grandpa this week; pretty amiable?"
LINE 318: "Very; why, have you got into a scrape, and want to know how he'll take
LINE 319: it?" asked Jo rather sharply.
LINE 320: "Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face, and say 'All
LINE 321: right,' if it wasn't?" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.
LINE 322: "No, I don't."
LINE 323: "Then don't go and be suspicious; I only want some money," said Laurie,
LINE 324: walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.
LINE 325: "You spend a great deal, Teddy."
LINE 326: "Bless you, _I_ don't spend it; it spends itself, somehow, and is gone
LINE 327: before I know it."
LINE 328: "You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and
LINE 329: can't say 'No' to any one. We heard about Henshaw, and all you did for
LINE 330: him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,"
LINE 331: said Jo warmly.
LINE 332: "Oh, he made a mountain out of a mole-hill. You wouldn't have me let
LINE 333: that fine fellow work himself to death, just for the want of a little
LINE 334: help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?"
LINE 335: "Of course not; but I don't see the use of your having seventeen
LINE 336: waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I
LINE 337: thought you'd got over the dandy period; but every now and then it
LINE 338: breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,--to
LINE 339: make your head look like a scrubbing-brush, wear a strait-jacket,
LINE 340: orange gloves, and clumping, square-toed boots. If it was cheap
LINE 341: ugliness, I'd say nothing; but it costs as much as the other, and I
LINE 342: don't get any satisfaction out of it."
LINE 343: Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that
LINE 344: the felt-basin fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded
LINE 345: him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
LINE 346: rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed
LINE 347: it into his pocket.
LINE 348: "Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all through
LINE 349: the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get myself up
LINE 350: regardless of expense, to-morrow, and be a satisfaction to my friends."
LINE 351: "I'll leave you in peace if you'll _only_ let your hair grow. I'm not
LINE 352: aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like
LINE 353: a young prize-fighter," observed Jo severely.
LINE 354: "This unassuming style promotes study; that's why we adopt it," returned
LINE 355: Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily
LINE 356: sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for
LINE 357: quarter-of-an-inch-long stubble.
LINE 358: "By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate
LINE 359: about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in
LINE 360: a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little passion in the bud,
LINE 361: hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder-brotherly tone, after
LINE 362: a minute's silence.
LINE 363: "Of course he had; we don't want any more marrying in this family for
LINE 364: years to come. Mercy on us, what _are_ the children thinking of?" and Jo
LINE 365: looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in
LINE 366: their teens.
LINE 367: "It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You are
LINE 368: a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left lamenting,"
LINE 369: said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.
LINE 370: "Don't be alarmed; I'm not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want
LINE 371: me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a
LINE 372: family."
LINE 373: "You won't give any one a chance," said Laurie, with a sidelong glance,
LINE 374: and a little more color than before in his sunburnt face. "You won't
LINE 375: show the soft side of your character; and if a fellow gets a peep at it
LINE 376: by accident, and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as
LINE 377: Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart,--throw cold water over him,--and get
LINE 378: so thorny no one dares touch or look at you."
LINE 379: "I don't like that sort of thing; I'm too busy to be worried with
LINE 380: nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't
LINE 381: say any more about it; Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we
LINE 382: talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get
LINE 383: cross, so let's change the subject;" and Jo looked quite ready to fling
LINE 384: cold water on the slightest provocation.
LINE 385: Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a
LINE 386: long low whistle, and the fearful prediction, as they parted at the
LINE 387: gate, "Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."
