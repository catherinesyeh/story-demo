LINE 1: I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the
LINE 2: mother and daughters; such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to
LINE 3: describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely
LINE 4: saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's
LINE 5: tender hope was realized; for when Beth woke from that long, healing
LINE 6: sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell _were_ the little rose
LINE 7: and mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled, and
LINE 8: nestled close into the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry
LINE 9: longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls
LINE 10: waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which
LINE 11: clung to hers even in sleep. Hannah had "dished up" an astonishing
LINE 12: breakfast for the traveller, finding it impossible to vent her
LINE 13: excitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like
LINE 14: dutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of
LINE 15: father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays
LINE 16: which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable
LINE 17: comfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out
LINE 18: with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.
LINE 19: What a strange, yet pleasant day that was! so brilliant and gay without,
LINE 20: for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow; so quiet and
LINE 21: reposeful within, for every one slept, spent with watching, and a
LINE 22: Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah
LINE 23: mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off,
LINE 24: Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten
LINE 25: boats, safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave
LINE 26: Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at,
LINE 27: touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered
LINE 28: treasure.
LINE 29: Laurie, meanwhile, posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well
LINE 30: that Aunt March actually "sniffed" herself, and never once said, "I told
LINE 31: you so." Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good
LINE 32: thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her
LINE 33: tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never
LINE 34: even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in
LINE 35: Laurie's opinion, that she behaved "like a capital little woman." Even
LINE 36: Polly seemed impressed, for he called her "good girl," blessed her
LINE 37: buttons, and begged her to "come and take a walk, dear," in his most
LINE 38: affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright
LINE 39: wintry weather; but, discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in
LINE 40: spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest
LINE 41: on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time
LINE 42: about it; and, when she returned, he was stretched out, with both arms
LINE 43: under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the
LINE 44: curtains, and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.
LINE 45: After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night,
LINE 46: and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by
LINE 47: Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good
LINE 48: many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my
LINE 49: private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her
LINE 50: mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation
LINE 51: in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone
LINE 52: together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its
LINE 53: purpose was explained to her.
LINE 54: "On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," looking from the dusty
LINE 55: rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its
LINE 56: garland of evergreen. "It is an excellent plan to have some place where
LINE 57: we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good
LINE 58: many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we
LINE 59: ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this?"
LINE 60: "Yes, mother; and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big
LINE 61: closet to put my books, and the copy of that picture which I've tried to
LINE 62: make. The woman's face is not good,--it's too beautiful for me to
LINE 63: draw,--but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to
LINE 64: think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and
LINE 65: that helps me."
LINE 66: As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ-child on his mother's knee, Mrs.
LINE 67: March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said
LINE 68: nothing, but Amy understood the look, and, after a minute's pause, she
LINE 69: added gravely,--
LINE 70: "I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the
LINE 71: ring to-day; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my
LINE 72: finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me
LINE 73: always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too
LINE 74: big. I'd like to wear them, mother; can I?"
LINE 75: "They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such
LINE 76: ornaments, Amy," said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with
LINE 77: the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard,
LINE 78: formed of two tiny, golden hands clasped together.
LINE 79: "I'll try not to be vain," said Amy. "I don't think I like it only
LINE 80: because it's so pretty; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story
LINE 81: wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."
LINE 82: "Do you mean Aunt March?" asked her mother, laughing.
LINE 83: "No, to remind me not to be selfish." Amy looked so earnest and sincere
LINE 84: about it, that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to
LINE 85: the little plan.
LINE 86: "I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties,' and
LINE 87: being selfish is the largest one in it; so I'm going to try hard to cure
LINE 88: it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason every one loves
LINE 89: her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel
LINE 90: half so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them;
LINE 91: but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm
LINE 92: going to try and be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my
LINE 93: resolutions; but if I had something always about me to remind me, I
LINE 94: guess I should do better. May I try this way?"
LINE 95: "Yes; but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your
LINE 96: ring, dear, and do your best; I think you will prosper, for the sincere
LINE 97: wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up
LINE 98: your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again."
LINE 99: That evening, while Meg was writing to her father, to report the
LINE 100: traveller's safe arrival, Jo slipped up stairs into Beth's room, and,
LINE 101: finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her
LINE 102: fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.
LINE 103: "What is it, deary?" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face
LINE 104: which invited confidence.
LINE 105: "I want to tell you something, mother."
LINE 106: "About Meg?"
LINE 107: "How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a little
LINE 108: thing, it fidgets me."
LINE 109: "Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn't
LINE 110: been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.
LINE 111: "No, I should have shut the door in his face if he had," said Jo,
LINE 112: settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. "Last summer Meg
LINE 113: left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences', and only one was returned.
LINE 114: We forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it. He
LINE 115: kept it in his waistcoat pocket, and once it fell out, and Teddy joked
LINE 116: him about it, and Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg, but didn't dare
LINE 117: say so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn't it a _dread_ful
LINE 118: state of things?"
LINE 119: "Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious
LINE 120: look.
LINE 121: "Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!" cried
LINE 122: Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. "In novels, the girls
LINE 123: show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and
LINE 124: acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort: she eats
LINE 125: and drinks and sleeps, like a sensible creature: she looks straight in
LINE 126: my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when
LINE 127: Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me
LINE 128: as he ought."
LINE 129: "Then you fancy that Meg is _not_ interested in John?"
LINE 130: "Who?" cried Jo, staring.
LINE 131: "Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now; we fell into the way of doing so at
LINE 132: the hospital, and he likes it."
LINE 133: "Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part: he's been good to father, and
LINE 134: you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean
LINE 135: thing! to go petting papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into
LINE 136: liking him;" and Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.
LINE 137: "My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened.
LINE 138: John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor
LINE 139: father that we couldn't help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open
LINE 140: and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a
LINE 141: comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our
LINE 142: leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him
LINE 143: if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse
LINE 144: to listen to him; but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so
LINE 145: young."
LINE 146: "Of course not; it would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing;
LINE 147: I felt it; and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry
LINE 148: Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."
LINE 149: This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile; but she said gravely, "Jo, I
LINE 150: confide in you, and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John
LINE 151: comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings
LINE 152: toward him."
LINE 153: "She'll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then
LINE 154: it will be all up with her. She's got such a soft heart, it will melt
LINE 155: like butter in the sun if any one looks sentimentally at her. She read
LINE 156: the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me
LINE 157: when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly
LINE 158: name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and
LINE 159: fun, and cosy times together. I see it all! they'll go lovering around
LINE 160: the house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good
LINE 161: to me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,
LINE 162: and make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and
LINE 163: everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! why weren't we
LINE 164: all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."
LINE 165: Jo leaned her chin on her knees, in a disconsolate attitude, and shook
LINE 166: her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up
LINE 167: with an air of relief.
LINE 168: "You don't like it, mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about his
LINE 169: business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we
LINE 170: always have been."
LINE 171: "I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to
LINE 172: homes of your own, in time; but I do want to keep my girls as long as I
LINE 173: can; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only
LINE 174: seventeen, and it will be some years before John can make a home for
LINE 175: her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in
LINE 176: any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one
LINE 177: another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is
LINE 178: conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My
LINE 179: pretty, tender-hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her."
LINE 180: "Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked Jo, as her mother's
LINE 181: voice faltered a little over the last words.
LINE 182: "Money is a good and useful thing, Jo; and I hope my girls will never
LINE 183: feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should
LINE 184: like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,
LINE 185: which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make
LINE 186: Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable
LINE 187: position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with
LINE 188: love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your
LINE 189: good fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can
LINE 190: be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and
LINE 191: some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see
LINE 192: Meg begin humbly, for, if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the
LINE 193: possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune."
LINE 194: "I understand, mother, and quite agree; but I'm disappointed about Meg,
LINE 195: for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by and by, and sit in the lap of
LINE 196: luxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice?" asked Jo, looking up, with a
LINE 197: brighter face.
LINE 198: "He is younger than she, you know," began Mrs. March; but Jo broke in,--
LINE 199: "Only a little; he's old for his age, and tall; and can be quite
LINE 200: grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous and
LINE 201: good, and loves us all; and _I_ say it's a pity my plan is spoilt."
LINE 202: "I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg, and altogether too
LINE 203: much of a weathercock, just now, for any one to depend on. Don't make
LINE 204: plans, Jo; but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can't
LINE 205: meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic
LINE 206: rubbish,' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship."
LINE 207: "Well, I won't; but I hate to see things going all criss-cross and
LINE 208: getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten
LINE 209: it out. I wish wearing flat-irons on our heads would keep us from
LINE 210: growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens, cats,--more's the
LINE 211: pity!"
LINE 212: "What's that about flat-irons and cats?" asked Meg, as she crept into
LINE 213: the room, with the finished letter in her hand.
LINE 214: "Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed; come, Peggy," said
LINE 215: Jo, unfolding herself, like an animated puzzle.
LINE 216: "Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to
LINE 217: John," said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter, and gave it
LINE 218: back.
LINE 219: "Do you call him 'John'?" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes
LINE 220: looking down into her mother's.
LINE 221: "Yes; he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,"
LINE 222: replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.
LINE 223: "I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good-night, mother, dear. It is so
LINE 224: inexpressibly comfortable to have you here," was Meg's quiet answer.
LINE 225: The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one; and, as she went
LINE 226: away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, "She
LINE 227: does not love John yet, but will soon learn to."
