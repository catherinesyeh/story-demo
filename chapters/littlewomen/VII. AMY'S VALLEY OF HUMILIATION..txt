LINE 1: [Illustration: The Cyclops]
LINE 2: "That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy, one day, as Laurie
LINE 3: clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.
LINE 4: "How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? and very handsome
LINE 5: ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about
LINE 6: her friend.
LINE 7: "I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need fire
LINE 8: up when I admire his riding."
LINE 9: "Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she called him
LINE 10: a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.
LINE 11: "You needn't be so rude; it's only a 'lapse of lingy,' as Mr. Davis
LINE 12: says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. "I just wish I had a
LINE 13: little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she added, as if to
LINE 14: herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.
LINE 15: "Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's
LINE 16: second blunder.
LINE 17: "I need it so much; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to
LINE 18: have the rag-money for a month."
LINE 19: "In debt, Amy? What do you mean?" and Meg looked sober.
LINE 20: "Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you
LINE 21: know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged
LINE 22: at the shop."
LINE 23: "Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking
LINE 24: bits of rubber to make balls;" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,
LINE 25: Amy looked so grave and important.
LINE 26: "Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to
LINE 27: be thought mean, you must do it, too. It's nothing but limes now, for
LINE 28: every one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading
LINE 29: them off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at
LINE 30: recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she's mad
LINE 31: with her, she eats one before her face, and don't offer even a suck.
LINE 32: They treat by turns; and I've had ever so many, but haven't returned
LINE 33: them; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know."
LINE 34: "How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?" asked Meg, taking
LINE 35: out her purse.
LINE 36: "A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat
LINE 37: for you. Don't you like limes?"
LINE 38: "Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long
LINE 39: as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."
LINE 40: "Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I'll have a
LINE 41: grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate
LINE 42: about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering
LINE 43: for one."
LINE 44: Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the
LINE 45: temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper
LINE 46: parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.
LINE 47: During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four
LINE 48: delicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,
LINE 49: circulated through her "set," and the attentions of her friends became
LINE 50: quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the
LINE 51: spot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and
LINE 52: Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her
LINE 53: limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish
LINE 54: answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's
LINE 55: cutting remarks about "some persons whose noses were not too flat to
LINE 56: smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud
LINE 57: to ask for them;" and she instantly crushed "that Snow girl's" hopes by
LINE 58: the withering telegram, "You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for
LINE 59: you won't get any."
LINE 60: A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and
LINE 61: Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe
LINE 62: rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the
LINE 63: airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a
LINE 64: fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.
LINE 65: No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed
LINE 66: himself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,
LINE 67: informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her
LINE 68: desk.
LINE 69: Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly
LINE 70: vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the
LINE 71: law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after
LINE 72: a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and
LINE 73: newspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden
LINE 74: distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that
LINE 75: one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys
LINE 76: are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are
LINE 77: infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical
LINE 78: tempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis
LINE 79: knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so
LINE 80: he was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and
LINE 81: examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most
LINE 82: unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had
LINE 83: evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east
LINE 84: wind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done
LINE 85: him the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the
LINE 86: expressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, "he was as
LINE 87: nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear." The word "limes" was like
LINE 88: fire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with
LINE 89: an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.
LINE 90: "Young ladies, attention, if you please!"
LINE 91: At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,
LINE 92: gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.
LINE 93: "Miss March, come to the desk."
LINE 94: Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed
LINE 95: her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.
LINE 96: "Bring with you the limes you have in your desk," was the unexpected
LINE 97: command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.
LINE 98: "Don't take all," whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence
LINE 99: of mind.
LINE 100: Amy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.
LINE 101: Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when
LINE 102: that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis
LINE 103: particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust
LINE 104: added to his wrath.
LINE 105: "Is that all?"
LINE 106: "Not quite," stammered Amy.
LINE 107: "Bring the rest immediately."
LINE 108: With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.
LINE 109: "You are sure there are no more?"
LINE 110: "I never lie, sir."
LINE 111: "So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them
LINE 112: out of the window."
LINE 113: There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the
LINE 114: last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.
LINE 115: Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;
LINE 116: and as each doomed couple--looking oh! so plump and juicy--fell from her
LINE 117: reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the
LINE 118: girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the
LINE 119: little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was too
LINE 120: much; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable
LINE 121: Davis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.
LINE 122: As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous "Hem!"
LINE 123: and said, in his most impressive manner,--
LINE 124: "Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry
LINE 125: this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I
LINE 126: _never_ break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand."
LINE 127: Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring
LINE 128: look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.
LINE 129: She was rather a favorite with "old Davis," as, of course, he was
LINE 130: called, and it's my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word
LINE 131: if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in
LINE 132: a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,
LINE 133: and sealed the culprit's fate.
LINE 134: "Your hand, Miss March!" was the only answer her mute appeal received;
LINE 135: and, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her
LINE 136: head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her
LINE 137: little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no
LINE 138: difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck;
LINE 139: and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her
LINE 140: down.
LINE 141: [Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]
LINE 142: "You will now stand on the platform till recess," said Mr. Davis,
LINE 143: resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.
LINE 144: That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and
LINE 145: see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few
LINE 146: enemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,
LINE 147: seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop
LINE 148: down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of
LINE 149: wrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking
LINE 150: the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what
LINE 151: now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that
LINE 152: the girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before
LINE 153: them.
LINE 154: During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little
LINE 155: girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it
LINE 156: might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard
LINE 157: experience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been
LINE 158: governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her
LINE 159: before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten
LINE 160: in the sting of the thought,--
LINE 161: "I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!"
LINE 162: The fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and
LINE 163: the word "Recess!" had never seemed so welcome to her before.
LINE 164: "You can go, Miss March," said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,
LINE 165: uncomfortable.
LINE 166: He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,
LINE 167: without a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her
LINE 168: things, and left the place "forever," as she passionately declared to
LINE 169: herself. She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older
LINE 170: girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at
LINE 171: once. Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted
LINE 172: her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the
LINE 173: insulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved
LINE 174: kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully
LINE 175: proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her
LINE 176: fist at the "villain," and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him
LINE 177: under her pestle.
LINE 178: No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the
LINE 179: sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in
LINE 180: the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo
LINE 181: appeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and
LINE 182: delivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy's property, and
LINE 183: departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as
LINE 184: if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.
LINE 185: "Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a
LINE 186: little every day, with Beth," said Mrs. March, that evening. "I don't
LINE 187: approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.
LINE 188: Davis's manner of teaching, and don't think the girls you associate with
LINE 189: are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I
LINE 190: send you anywhere else."
LINE 191: "That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old
LINE 192: school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes," sighed
LINE 193: Amy, with the air of a martyr.
LINE 194: "I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved
LINE 195: some punishment for disobedience," was the severe reply, which rather
LINE 196: disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.
LINE 197: "Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?"
LINE 198: cried Amy.
LINE 199: "I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault," replied her
LINE 200: mother; "but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a milder
LINE 201: method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite
LINE 202: time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and
LINE 203: virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the
LINE 204: finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness
LINE 205: will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing
LINE 206: and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power
LINE 207: is modesty."
LINE 208: "So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. "I
LINE 209: knew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she
LINE 210: didn't know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when
LINE 211: she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her."
LINE 212: "I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I'm so
LINE 213: stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.
LINE 214: "You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,"
LINE 215: answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his
LINE 216: merry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face
LINE 217: in the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.
LINE 218: [Illustration: You do know her]
LINE 219: Jo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who
LINE 220: could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So
LINE 221: Laurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly
LINE 222: lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his
LINE 223: character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,
LINE 224: said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--
LINE 225: "Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"
LINE 226: "Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will
LINE 227: make a fine man, if not spoilt by petting," replied her mother.
LINE 228: "And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.
LINE 229: "Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so
LINE 230: much."
LINE 231: "I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to
LINE 232: show off, or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.
LINE 233: "These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and
LINE 234: conversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display
LINE 235: them," said Mrs. March.
LINE 236: "Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and
LINE 237: ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added Jo; and the
LINE 238: lecture ended in a laugh.
LINE 239: [Illustration: Girls, where are you going?]
