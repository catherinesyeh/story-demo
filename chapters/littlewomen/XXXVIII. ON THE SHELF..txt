LINE 1: In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,
LINE 2: when "_Vive la libert√©_" becomes their motto. In America, as every one
LINE 3: knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their
LINE 4: freedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate
LINE 5: with the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as
LINE 6: close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they
LINE 7: like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the
LINE 8: wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a
LINE 9: very pretty woman the other day, "I'm as handsome as ever, but no one
LINE 10: takes any notice of me because I'm married."
LINE 11: Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience
LINE 12: this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world
LINE 13: primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and
LINE 14: beloved than ever.
LINE 15: As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very
LINE 16: strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter
LINE 17: exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded
LINE 18: over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender
LINE 19: mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen
LINE 20: department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely
LINE 21: attentions he had been accustomed to receive; but, as he adored his
LINE 22: babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing,
LINE 23: with masculine ignorance, that peace would soon be restored. But three
LINE 24: months passed, and there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and
LINE 25: nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was
LINE 26: neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life "aisy," kept him on short
LINE 27: commons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small
LINE 28: commissions for the captive mamma; if he came gayly in at night, eager
LINE 29: to embrace his family, he was quenched by a "Hush! they are just asleep
LINE 30: after worrying all day." If he proposed a little amusement at home, "No,
LINE 31: it would disturb the babies." If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he
LINE 32: was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided "Leave my children
LINE 33: for pleasure, never!" His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions
LINE 34: of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the
LINE 35: night; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the
LINE 36: presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp
LINE 37: sounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening,
LINE 38: Demi's colic got into the shipping-list, and Daisy's fall affected the
LINE 39: price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.
LINE 40: The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of
LINE 41: his wife; home was merely a nursery, and the perpetual "hushing" made
LINE 42: him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts
LINE 43: of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no
LINE 44: signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles
LINE 45: do,--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone
LINE 46: to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over
LINE 47: for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his
LINE 48: own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a
LINE 49: lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she
LINE 50: performed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright
LINE 51: and attractive, the chess-board ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay
LINE 52: gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.
LINE 53: John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely;
LINE 54: but as it was, he gratefully took the next best thing, and enjoyed his
LINE 55: neighbor's society.
LINE 56: Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a
LINE 57: relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the
LINE 58: parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But by and
LINE 59: by, when the teething worry was over, and the idols went to sleep at
LINE 60: proper hours, leaving mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and
LINE 61: find her work-basket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in
LINE 62: his old dressing-gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender.
LINE 63: She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did
LINE 64: not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the
LINE 65: many evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn
LINE 66: out with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind
LINE 67: which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares
LINE 68: oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much
LINE 69: devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as
LINE 70: if they were all nerve and no muscle.
LINE 71: "Yes," she would say, looking in the glass, "I'm getting old and ugly;
LINE 72: John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife
LINE 73: and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the
LINE 74: babies love me; they don't care if I am thin and pale, and haven't time
LINE 75: to crimp my hair; they are my comfort, and some day John will see what
LINE 76: I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?"
LINE 77: To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a
LINE 78: crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which
LINE 79: soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as
LINE 80: politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss
LINE 81: interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.
LINE 82: Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one
LINE 83: day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping
LINE 84: spirits had not escaped her observation.
LINE 85: "I wouldn't tell any one except you, mother; but I really do need
LINE 86: advice, for, if John goes on so much longer I might as well be widowed,"
LINE 87: replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib, with an injured
LINE 88: air.
LINE 89: "Goes on how, my dear?" asked her mother anxiously.
LINE 90: "He's away all day, and at night, when I want to see him, he is
LINE 91: continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should have
LINE 92: the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even
LINE 93: the best of them."
LINE 94: "So are women; don't blame John till you see where you are wrong
LINE 95: yourself."
LINE 96: "But it can't be right for him to neglect me."
LINE 97: "Don't you neglect him?"
LINE 98: "Why, mother, I thought you'd take my part!"
LINE 99: "So I do, as far as sympathizing goes; but I think the fault is yours,
LINE 100: Meg."
LINE 101: "I don't see how."
LINE 102: "Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you
LINE 103: made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure
LINE 104: time?"
LINE 105: "No; but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."
LINE 106: "I think you could, dear; and I think you ought. May I speak quite
LINE 107: freely, and will you remember that it's mother who blames as well as
LINE 108: mother who sympathizes?"
LINE 109: "Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel
LINE 110: as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for
LINE 111: everything."
LINE 112: Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and, with a little
LINE 113: interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly
LINE 114: together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than
LINE 115: ever.
LINE 116: "You have only made the mistake that most young wives make,--forgotten
LINE 117: your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural
LINE 118: and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before
LINE 119: you take to different ways; for children should draw you nearer than
LINE 120: ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing
LINE 121: to do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not
LINE 122: spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time."
LINE 123: "I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous; and
LINE 124: I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him,
LINE 125: and I don't know how to tell him without words."
LINE 126: "Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for
LINE 127: his little home; but it isn't home without you, and you are always in
LINE 128: the nursery."
LINE 129: "Oughtn't I to be there?"
LINE 130: "Not all the time; too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you
LINE 131: are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well
LINE 132: as to the babies; don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out
LINE 133: of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as
LINE 134: well as yours, and the children need him; let him feel that he has his
LINE 135: part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be
LINE 136: better for you all."
LINE 137: "You really think so, mother?"
LINE 138: "I know it, Meg, for I've tried it; and I seldom give advice unless I've
LINE 139: proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just
LINE 140: as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself
LINE 141: wholly to you. Poor father took to his books, after I had refused all
LINE 142: offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled
LINE 143: along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoilt
LINE 144: her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell
LINE 145: sick myself. Then father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything,
LINE 146: and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been
LINE 147: able to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home
LINE 148: happiness: he does not let business wean him from the little cares and
LINE 149: duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy
LINE 150: my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but
LINE 151: at home we work together, always."
LINE 152: "It is so, mother; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children
LINE 153: what you have been to yours. Show me how; I'll do anything you say."
LINE 154: "You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I'd let
LINE 155: John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs
LINE 156: training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have often
LINE 157: proposed, let Hannah come and help you; she is a capital nurse, and you
LINE 158: may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. You
LINE 159: need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his
LINE 160: wife again. Go out more; keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the
LINE 161: sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair
LINE 162: weather. Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes,--talk
LINE 163: with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in
LINE 164: that way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman,
LINE 165: but understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part
LINE 166: in the world's work, for it all affects you and yours."
LINE 167: "John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask
LINE 168: questions about politics and things."
LINE 169: "I don't believe he would; love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom
LINE 170: could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn't
LINE 171: find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers."
LINE 172: "I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I _have_ neglected him sadly, but I
LINE 173: thought I was right, and he never said anything."
LINE 174: "He tried not to be selfish, but he _has_ felt rather forlorn, I fancy.
LINE 175: This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow
LINE 176: apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together; for the
LINE 177: first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it;
LINE 178: and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years
LINE 179: of the little lives given them to train. Don't let John be a stranger to
LINE 180: the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this
LINE 181: world of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you
LINE 182: will learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear,
LINE 183: good-by; think over mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good,
LINE 184: and God bless you all!"
LINE 185: Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the
LINE 186: first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course
LINE 187: the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they
LINE 188: found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted.
LINE 189: Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but papa was not so easily
LINE 190: subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt
LINE 191: at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a
LINE 192: trifle of his sire's firmness of character,--we won't call it
LINE 193: obstinacy,--and when he made up his little mind to have or to do
LINE 194: anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change
LINE 195: that pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be
LINE 196: taught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was
LINE 197: too soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when
LINE 198: he undertook to "wrastle" with "parpar," he always got the worst of it;
LINE 199: yet, like the Englishman, Baby respected the man who conquered him, and
LINE 200: loved the father whose grave "No, no," was more impressive than all
LINE 201: mamma's love-pats.
LINE 202: A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social
LINE 203: evening with John; so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in
LINE 204: order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that
LINE 205: nothing should interfere with her experiment. But, unfortunately, Demi's
LINE 206: most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he
LINE 207: decided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sung and rocked, told stories
LINE 208: and tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain,
LINE 209: the big eyes wouldn't shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,
LINE 210: like the chubby little bunch of good-nature she was, naughty Demi lay
LINE 211: staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression
LINE 212: of countenance.
LINE 213: "Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while mamma runs down and gives
LINE 214: poor papa his tea?" asked Meg, as the hall-door softly closed, and the
LINE 215: well-known step went tiptoeing into the dining-room.
LINE 216: "Me has tea!" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.
LINE 217: "No; but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go
LINE 218: bye-by like Daisy. Will you, lovey?"
LINE 219: "Iss!" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the
LINE 220: desired day.
LINE 221: Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away, and ran
LINE 222: down to greet her husband with a smiling face, and the little blue bow
LINE 223: in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once, and
LINE 224: said, with pleased surprise,--
LINE 225: "Why, little mother, how gay we are to-night. Do you expect company?"
LINE 226: "Only you, dear."
LINE 227: "Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?"
LINE 228: "No; I'm tired of being a dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always
LINE 229: make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are; so why
LINE 230: shouldn't I when I have the time?"
LINE 231: "I do it out of respect to you, my dear," said old-fashioned John.
LINE 232: "Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again,
LINE 233: as she nodded to him over the teapot.
LINE 234: "Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes
LINE 235: right. I drink your health, dear." And John sipped his tea with an air
LINE 236: of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration, however; for, as
LINE 237: he put down his cup, the door-handle rattled mysteriously, and a little
LINE 238: voice was heard, saying impatiently,--
LINE 239: "Opy doy; me's tummin!"
LINE 240: "It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is,
LINE 241: downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas," said
LINE 242: Meg, answering the call.
LINE 243: [Illustration: Mornin' now]
LINE 244: "Mornin' now," announced Demi, in a joyful tone, as he entered, with his
LINE 245: long night-gown gracefully festooned over his arm, and every curl
LINE 246: bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eying the "cakies" with
LINE 247: loving glances.
LINE 248: "No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor
LINE 249: mamma; then you can have the little cake with sugar on it."
LINE 250: "Me loves parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal
LINE 251: knee, and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to
LINE 252: Meg,--
LINE 253: "If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do
LINE 254: it, or he will never learn to mind you."
LINE 255: "Yes, of course. Come, Demi;" and Meg led her son away, feeling a
LINE 256: strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,
LINE 257: laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as
LINE 258: soon as they reached the nursery.
LINE 259: Nor was he disappointed; for that short-sighted woman actually gave him
LINE 260: a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more
LINE 261: promenades till morning.
LINE 262: "Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and
LINE 263: regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.
LINE 264: Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when
LINE 265: the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by
LINE 266: boldly demanding,--
LINE 267: "More sudar, marmar."
LINE 268: "Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against the engaging
LINE 269: little sinner. "We shall never know any peace till that child learns to
LINE 270: go to bed properly. You have made a slave of yourself long enough; give
LINE 271: him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed
LINE 272: and leave him, Meg."
LINE 273: "He won't stay there; he never does, unless I sit by him."
LINE 274: "I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as mamma
LINE 275: bids you."
LINE 276: "S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted
LINE 277: "cakie," and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.
LINE 278: "You must never say that to papa; I shall carry you if you don't go
LINE 279: yourself."
LINE 280: "Go 'way; me don't love parpar;" and Demi retired to his mother's skirts
LINE 281: for protection.
LINE 282: But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the
LINE 283: enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John," which struck the culprit with
LINE 284: dismay; for when mamma deserted him, then the judgment-day was at hand.
LINE 285: Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong
LINE 286: hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but
LINE 287: openly defied papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the way
LINE 288: upstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on
LINE 289: the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by
LINE 290: the tail of his little toga, and put back again, which lively
LINE 291: performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out, when he
LINE 292: devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise
LINE 293: usually conquered Meg; but John sat as unmoved as the post which is
LINE 294: popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no
LINE 295: story; even the light was put out, and only the red glow of the fire
LINE 296: enlivened the "big dark" which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than
LINE 297: fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for
LINE 298: "marmar," as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his
LINE 299: tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive wail
LINE 300: which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's heart, and she ran up
LINE 301: to say beseechingly,--
LINE 302: "Let me stay with him; he'll be good, now, John."
LINE 303: "No, my dear, I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him; and he
LINE 304: must, if I stay here all night."
LINE 305: "But he'll cry himself sick," pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for
LINE 306: deserting her boy.
LINE 307: "No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off, and then the matter
LINE 308: is settled; for he will understand that he has got to mind. Don't
LINE 309: interfere; I'll manage him."
LINE 310: "He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness."
LINE 311: "He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoilt by indulgence. Go
LINE 312: down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."
LINE 313: When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never
LINE 314: regretted her docility.
LINE 315: "Please let me kiss him once, John?"
LINE 316: "Certainly. Demi, say 'good-night' to mamma, and let her go and rest,
LINE 317: for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."
LINE 318: Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory; for after it
LINE 319: was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom
LINE 320: of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.
LINE 321: "Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll cover him
LINE 322: up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest," thought John, creeping to
LINE 323: the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.
LINE 324: But he wasn't; for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes
LINE 325: opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying,
LINE 326: with a penitent hiccough, "Me's dood, now."
LINE 327: Sitting on the stairs, outside, Meg wondered at the long silence which
LINE 328: followed the uproar; and, after imagining all sorts of impossible
LINE 329: accidents, she slipped into the room, to set her fears at rest. Demi lay
LINE 330: fast asleep; not in his usual spread-eagle attitude, but in a subdued
LINE 331: bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and holding his
LINE 332: father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and
LINE 333: had gone to sleep a sadder and a wiser baby. So held, John had waited
LINE 334: with womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold; and, while
LINE 335: waiting, had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than
LINE 336: with his whole day's work.
LINE 337: As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to
LINE 338: herself, and then slipped away again, saying, in a satisfied tone,--
LINE 339: "I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies: he _does_
LINE 340: know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi _is_ getting
LINE 341: too much for me."
LINE 342: When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful
LINE 343: wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet,
LINE 344: and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election,
LINE 345: if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some
LINE 346: kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was
LINE 347: such a transparent little person, she couldn't keep a secret to save her
LINE 348: life, and therefore the clew would soon appear. He read a long debate
LINE 349: with the most amiable readiness, and then explained it in his most lucid
LINE 350: manner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent
LINE 351: questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the
LINE 352: nation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she
LINE 353: decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the mission
LINE 354: of politicians seemed to be calling each other names; but she kept these
LINE 355: feminine ideas to herself, and when John paused, shook her head, and
LINE 356: said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity,--
LINE 357: "Well, I really don't see what we are coming to."
LINE 358: John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty
LINE 359: little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with
LINE 360: the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.
LINE 361: "She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like
LINE 362: millinery for hers, that's only fair," thought John the Just, adding
LINE 363: aloud,--
LINE 364: "That's very pretty; is it what you call a breakfast-cap?"
LINE 365: [Illustration: My dear man, it's a bonnet]
LINE 366: "My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theatre
LINE 367: bonnet."
LINE 368: "I beg your pardon; it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of
LINE 369: the fly-away things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?"
LINE 370: "These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so;" and
LINE 371: Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet, and regarding him with an air
LINE 372: of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.
LINE 373: "It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks
LINE 374: young and happy again," and John kissed the smiling face, to the great
LINE 375: detriment of the rosebud under the chin.
LINE 376: "I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new
LINE 377: concerts some night; I really need some music to put me in tune. Will
LINE 378: you, please?"
LINE 379: "Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You
LINE 380: have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall
LINE 381: enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little mother?"
LINE 382: "Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous
LINE 383: and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and less
LINE 384: care; so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to
LINE 385: things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to
LINE 386: keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my
LINE 387: time. It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake
LINE 388: as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately, and
LINE 389: I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can. You don't object, I
LINE 390: hope?"
LINE 391: Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little
LINE 392: bonnet had from utter ruin; all that we have any business to know, is
LINE 393: that John did _not_ appear to object, judging from the changes which
LINE 394: gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all
LINE 395: Paradise by any means, but every one was better for the division of
LINE 396: labor system; the children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate,
LINE 397: steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg
LINE 398: recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome
LINE 399: exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her
LINE 400: sensible husband. Home grew home-like again, and John had no wish to
LINE 401: leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The Scotts came to the Brookes'
LINE 402: now, and every one found the little house a cheerful place, full of
LINE 403: happiness, content, and family love. Even gay Sallie Moffatt liked to go
LINE 404: there. "It is always so quiet and pleasant here; it does me good, Meg,"
LINE 405: she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to
LINE 406: discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of
LINE 407: splendid loneliness; for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies
LINE 408: there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for
LINE 409: her.
LINE 410: This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had
LINE 411: found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to
LINE 412: use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home-love and mutual
LINE 413: helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.
LINE 414: This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent
LINE 415: to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding
LINE 416: loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,
LINE 417: undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age; walking side by side, through fair
LINE 418: and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of
LINE 419: the good old Saxon word, the "house-band," and learning, as Meg learned,
LINE 420: that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of
LINE 421: ruling it, not as a queen, but a wise wife and mother.
