LINE 1: Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that
LINE 2: year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with the
LINE 3: grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends
LINE 4: said. They were all there, his grandfather,--oh, so proud!--Mr. and Mrs.
LINE 5: March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the
LINE 6: sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win
LINE 7: from the world by any after-triumphs.
LINE 8: "I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early
LINE 9: to-morrow; you'll come and meet me as usual, girls?" Laurie said, as he
LINE 10: put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.
LINE 11: He said "girls," but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up
LINE 12: the old custom; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful
LINE 13: boy anything, and answered warmly,--
LINE 14: "I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing '_Hail
LINE 15: the conquering hero comes_,' on a jews-harp."
LINE 16: Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think, in a sudden panic,
LINE 17: "Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?"
LINE 18: Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and
LINE 19: having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were
LINE 20: going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her
LINE 21: answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy
LINE 22: wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings. A call
LINE 23: at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn,
LINE 24: still further fortified her for the _tête-à-tête_, but when she saw a
LINE 25: stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn
LINE 26: about and run away.
LINE 27: "Where's the jews-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within
LINE 28: speaking distance.
LINE 29: "I forgot it;" and Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be
LINE 30: called lover-like.
LINE 31: She always used to take his arm on these occasions; now she did not, and
LINE 32: he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about
LINE 33: all sorts of far-away subjects, till they turned from the road into the
LINE 34: little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more
LINE 35: slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and, now and then, a
LINE 36: dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the
LINE 37: wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily,--
LINE 38: "Now you must have a good long holiday!"
LINE 39: "I intend to."
LINE 40: Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him
LINE 41: looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded
LINE 42: moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring,--
LINE 43: "No, Teddy, please don't!"
LINE 44: "I will, and you _must_ hear me. It's no use, Jo; we've got to have it
LINE 45: out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he answered, getting
LINE 46: flushed and excited all at once.
LINE 47: "Say what you like, then; I'll listen," said Jo, with a desperate sort
LINE 48: of patience.
LINE 49: Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to "have it
LINE 50: out," if he died in the attempt; so he plunged into the subject with
LINE 51: characteristic impetuosity, saying in a voice that _would_ get choky now
LINE 52: and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady,--
LINE 53: "I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo; couldn't help it, you've
LINE 54: been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me; now
LINE 55: I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I _can't_ go on
LINE 56: so any longer."
LINE 57: "I wanted to save you this; I thought you'd understand--" began Jo,
LINE 58: finding it a great deal harder than she expected.
LINE 59: "I know you did; but girls are so queer you never know what they mean.
LINE 60: They say No when they mean Yes, and drive a man out of his wits just for
LINE 61: the fun of it," returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an
LINE 62: undeniable fact.
LINE 63: "_I_ don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away
LINE 64: to keep you from it if I could."
LINE 65: "I thought so; it was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all
LINE 66: the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and
LINE 67: everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I hoped
LINE 68: you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough--" here there was a choke
LINE 69: that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he
LINE 70: cleared his "confounded throat."
LINE 71: "Yes, you are; you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful
LINE 72: to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't see why I can't love you
LINE 73: as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it
LINE 74: would be a lie to say I do when I don't."
LINE 75: "Really, truly, Jo?"
LINE 76: He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with
LINE 77: a look that she did not soon forget.
LINE 78: "Really, truly, dear."
LINE 79: They were in the grove now, close by the stile; and when the last words
LINE 80: fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as
LINE 81: if to go on, but for once in his life that fence was too much for him;
LINE 82: so he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that
LINE 83: Jo was frightened.
LINE 84: [Illustration: He laid his head down on the mossy post]
LINE 85: "O Teddy, I'm so sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it
LINE 86: would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard. I can't help it;
LINE 87: you know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people
LINE 88: if they don't," cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly
LINE 89: patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so
LINE 90: long ago.
LINE 91: "They do sometimes," said a muffled voice from the post.
LINE 92: "I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try
LINE 93: it," was the decided answer.
LINE 94: There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by
LINE 95: the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said
LINE 96: very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile,--
LINE 97: "Laurie, I want to tell you something."
LINE 98: He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out, in
LINE 99: a fierce tone--
LINE 100: "_Don't_ tell me that, Jo; I can't bear it now!"
LINE 101: "Tell what?" she asked, wondering at his violence.
LINE 102: "That you love that old man."
LINE 103: "What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.
LINE 104: "That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you
LINE 105: love him, I know I shall do something desperate;" and he looked as if he
LINE 106: would keep his word, as he clenched his hands, with a wrathful spark in
LINE 107: his eyes.
LINE 108: Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself, and said warmly, for she,
LINE 109: too, was getting excited with all this,--
LINE 110: "Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind,
LINE 111: and the best friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a
LINE 112: passion; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my
LINE 113: Professor. I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else."
LINE 114: "But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?"
LINE 115: "You'll love some one else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this
LINE 116: trouble."
LINE 117: "I _can't_ love any one else; and I'll never forget you, Jo, never!
LINE 118: never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.
LINE 119: "What _shall_ I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more
LINE 120: unmanageable than she expected. "You haven't heard what I wanted to tell
LINE 121: you. Sit down and listen; for indeed I want to do right and make you
LINE 122: happy," she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which
LINE 123: proved that she knew nothing about love.
LINE 124: Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on
LINE 125: the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,
LINE 126: and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was
LINE 127: not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part; for how
LINE 128: _could_ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes
LINE 129: full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or
LINE 130: two her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head
LINE 131: away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to
LINE 132: grow for her sake,--how touching that was, to be sure!--
LINE 133: "I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other,
LINE 134: because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very
LINE 135: miserable, if we were so foolish as to--" Jo paused a little over the
LINE 136: last word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression,--
LINE 137: "Marry,--no, we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect
LINE 138: saint, for you could make me anything you like."
LINE 139: "No, I can't. I've tried it and failed, and I won't risk our happiness
LINE 140: by such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall; so
LINE 141: we'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything
LINE 142: rash."
LINE 143: "Yes, we will if we get the chance," muttered Laurie rebelliously.
LINE 144: "Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case," implored
LINE 145: Jo, almost at her wit's end.
LINE 146: "I won't be reasonable; I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible
LINE 147: view;' it won't help me, and it only makes you harder. I don't believe
LINE 148: you've got any heart."
LINE 149: "I wish I hadn't!"
LINE 150: There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen,
LINE 151: Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he
LINE 152: said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously
LINE 153: wheedlesome before,--
LINE 154: "Don't disappoint us, dear! Every one expects it. Grandpa has set his
LINE 155: heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say
LINE 156: you will, and let's be happy. Do, do!"
LINE 157: Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of
LINE 158: mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that
LINE 159: she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but
LINE 160: she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.
LINE 161: "I can't say 'Yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm
LINE 162: right, by and by, and thank me for it"--she began solemnly.
LINE 163: "I'll be hanged if I do!" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning
LINE 164: with indignation at the bare idea.
LINE 165: "Yes, you will!" persisted Jo; "you'll get over this after a while, and
LINE 166: find some lovely, accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine
LINE 167: mistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and
LINE 168: odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel,--we
LINE 169: can't help it even now, you see,--and I shouldn't like elegant society
LINE 170: and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on
LINE 171: without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and
LINE 172: everything would be horrid!"
LINE 173: "Anything more?" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to
LINE 174: this prophetic burst.
LINE 175: "Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy
LINE 176: as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up
LINE 177: for any mortal man."
LINE 178: "I know better!" broke in Laurie. "You think so now; but there'll come a
LINE 179: time when you _will_ care for somebody, and you'll love him
LINE 180: tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way,
LINE 181: and I shall have to stand by and see it;" and the despairing lover cast
LINE 182: his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical,
LINE 183: if his face had not been so tragical.
LINE 184: "Yes, I _will_ live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love
LINE 185: him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!" cried Jo,
LINE 186: losing patience with poor Teddy. "I've done my best, but you _won't_ be
LINE 187: reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't
LINE 188: give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but
LINE 189: I'll never marry you; and the sooner you believe it, the better for both
LINE 190: of us,--so now!"
LINE 191: That speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as
LINE 192: if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply
LINE 193: away, saying, in a desperate sort of tone,--
LINE 194: "You'll be sorry some day, Jo."
LINE 195: "Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened her.
LINE 196: "To the devil!" was the consoling answer.
LINE 197: For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank,
LINE 198: toward the river; but it takes much folly, sin, or misery to send a
LINE 199: young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort
LINE 200: who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a
LINE 201: melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and
LINE 202: coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time
LINE 203: up the river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and
LINE 204: unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip
LINE 205: the trouble which he carried in his heart.
LINE 206: "That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent
LINE 207: state of mind, that I sha'n't dare to see him," she said; adding, as she
LINE 208: went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,
LINE 209: and buried it under the leaves,--
LINE 210: "Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.
LINE 211: I wish he'd love Beth; perhaps he may, in time, but I begin to think I
LINE 212: was mistaken about her. Oh dear! how can girls like to have lovers and
LINE 213: refuse them. I think it's dreadful."
LINE 214: Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight
LINE 215: to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke
LINE 216: down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old
LINE 217: gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He
LINE 218: found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,
LINE 219: and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo
LINE 220: that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly, and resolved to
LINE 221: carry his boy out of harm's way; for Young Impetuosity's parting words
LINE 222: to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.
LINE 223: When Laurie came home, dead tired, but quite composed, his grandfather
LINE 224: met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very
LINE 225: successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the
LINE 226: twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the
LINE 227: old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to
LINE 228: listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed
LINE 229: love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his
LINE 230: piano, and began to play. The windows were open; and Jo, walking in the
LINE 231: garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for
LINE 232: he played the "Sonata Pathétique," and played it as he never did before.
LINE 233: "That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry; give
LINE 234: us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was
LINE 235: full of sympathy, which he longed to show, but knew not how.
LINE 236: Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several
LINE 237: minutes, and would have got through bravely, if, in a momentary lull,
LINE 238: Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling,--
LINE 239: "Jo, dear, come in; I want you."
LINE 240: Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he
LINE 241: listened, he lost his place; the music ended with a broken chord, and
LINE 242: the musician sat silent in the dark.
LINE 243: "I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his
LINE 244: way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and
LINE 245: said, as gently as a woman,--
LINE 246: "I know, my boy, I know."
LINE 247: No answer for an instant; then Laurie asked sharply,--
LINE 248: "Who told you?"
LINE 249: "Jo herself."
LINE 250: "Then there's an end of it!" and he shook off his grandfather's hands
LINE 251: with an impatient motion; for, though grateful for the sympathy, his
LINE 252: man's pride could not bear a man's pity.
LINE 253: "Not quite; I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of
LINE 254: it," returned Mr. Laurence, with unusual mildness. "You won't care to
LINE 255: stay at home just now, perhaps?"
LINE 256: "I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her,
LINE 257: and I shall stay and do it as long as I like," interrupted Laurie, in a
LINE 258: defiant tone.
LINE 259: "Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the
LINE 260: girl can't help it; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away
LINE 261: for a time. Where will you go?"
LINE 262: "Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me;" and Laurie got up, with a
LINE 263: reckless laugh, that grated on his grandfather's ear.
LINE 264: "Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not
LINE 265: go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"
LINE 266: "I can't."
LINE 267: "But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got
LINE 268: through college."
LINE 269: "Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!" and Laurie walked fast through the
LINE 270: room, with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.
LINE 271: "I don't ask you to go alone; there's some one ready and glad to go with
LINE 272: you, anywhere in the world."
LINE 273: "Who, sir?" stopping to listen.
LINE 274: "Myself."
LINE 275: Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying
LINE 276: huskily,--
LINE 277: "I'm a selfish brute; but--you know--grandfather--"
LINE 278: "Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before, once
LINE 279: in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just
LINE 280: sit quietly down, and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried
LINE 281: out at once," said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if
LINE 282: fearful that he would break away, as his father had done before him.
LINE 283: "Well, sir, what is it?" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest
LINE 284: in face or voice.
LINE 285: "There is business in London that needs looking after; I meant you
LINE 286: should attend to it; but I can do it better myself, and things here will
LINE 287: get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost
LINE 288: everything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off
LINE 289: at any time."
LINE 290: "But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age," began
LINE 291: Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go
LINE 292: alone, if he went at all.
LINE 293: The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to
LINE 294: prevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that
LINE 295: it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a
LINE 296: natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind
LINE 297: him, he said stoutly,--
LINE 298: "Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it
LINE 299: will do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for travelling nowadays
LINE 300: is almost as easy as sitting in a chair."
LINE 301: A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,
LINE 302: or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--
LINE 303: "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden; I go because I think you'd
LINE 304: feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend to gad about with
LINE 305: you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my
LINE 306: own way. I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit
LINE 307: them; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you
LINE 308: will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's
LINE 309: content."
LINE 310: Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken, and the
LINE 311: world a howling wilderness; but at the sound of certain words which the
LINE 312: old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken
LINE 313: heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly
LINE 314: appeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a
LINE 315: spiritless tone,--
LINE 316: "Just as you like, sir; it doesn't matter where I go or what I do."
LINE 317: "It does to me, remember that, my lad; I give you entire liberty, but I
LINE 318: trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie."
LINE 319: "Anything you like, sir."
LINE 320: "Good," thought the old gentleman. "You don't care now, but there'll
LINE 321: come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm much
LINE 322: mistaken."
LINE 323: Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was
LINE 324: hot; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,
LINE 325: they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore
LINE 326: himself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody,
LINE 327: irritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress,
LINE 328: and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,
LINE 329: but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical
LINE 330: face that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy
LINE 331: sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his
LINE 332: unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to
LINE 333: attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a
LINE 334: relief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very
LINE 335: uncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the "poor, dear fellow was
LINE 336: going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy." Of course, he
LINE 337: smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad
LINE 338: superiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was
LINE 339: unalterable.
LINE 340: When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain
LINE 341: inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This
LINE 342: gayety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did,
LINE 343: for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with
LINE 344: a whisper full of motherly solicitude; then, feeling that he was going
LINE 345: very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the
LINE 346: afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a
LINE 347: minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look
LINE 348: round, came back, put his arms about her, as she stood on the step above
LINE 349: him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both
LINE 350: eloquent and pathetic.
LINE 351: "O Jo, can't you?"
LINE 352: [Illustration: O Jo, can't you?]
LINE 353: "Teddy, dear, I wish I could!"
LINE 354: That was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself
LINE 355: up, said "It's all right, never mind," and went away without another
LINE 356: word. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo _did_ mind; for while the
LINE 357: curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if
LINE 358: she had stabbed her dearest friend; and when he left her without a look
LINE 359: behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.
LINE 360: [Illustration: Tail-piece]
