LINE 1: [Illustration: Beth did have the fever]
LINE 2: Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than any one but Hannah and
LINE 3: the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.
LINE 4: Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her
LINE 5: own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the
LINE 6: excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,
LINE 7: and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote
LINE 8: letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not
LINE 9: think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind
LINE 10: Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of "Mrs. March bein' told, and worried
LINE 11: just for sech a trifle." Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night; not a
LINE 12: hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly
LINE 13: as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during
LINE 14: the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on
LINE 15: the coverlet, as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a
LINE 16: throat so swollen that there was no music left; a time when she did not
LINE 17: know the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names,
LINE 18: and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg
LINE 19: begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she "would
LINE 20: think of it, though there was no danger _yet_." A letter from Washington
LINE 21: added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not
LINE 22: think of coming home for a long while.
LINE 23: How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how
LINE 24: heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while
LINE 25: the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that
LINE 26: Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how
LINE 27: rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could
LINE 28: buy,--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of
LINE 29: life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that
LINE 30: suffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice
LINE 31: sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of
LINE 32: Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all
LINE 33: hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition, to
LINE 34: live for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those simple
LINE 35: virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more
LINE 36: than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to
LINE 37: be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service
LINE 38: would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how
LINE 39: many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie
LINE 40: haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the
LINE 41: grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young
LINE 42: neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Every one
LINE 43: missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she
LINE 44: did; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to
LINE 45: get a shroud for Minna; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and
LINE 46: good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how
LINE 47: many friends shy little Beth had made.
LINE 48: Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in
LINE 49: her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn _protégé_. She longed for
LINE 50: her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick;
LINE 51: and, in her quiet hours, she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent
LINE 52: loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write
LINE 53: soon; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that
LINE 54: father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these
LINE 55: intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing
LINE 56: to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy
LINE 57: sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,
LINE 58: Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to
LINE 59: send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.
LINE 60: The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind
LINE 61: blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death.
LINE 62: When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot
LINE 63: hand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low
LINE 64: tone, to Hannah,--
LINE 65: "If Mrs. March _can_ leave her husband, she'd better be sent for."
LINE 66: Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously; Meg
LINE 67: dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs
LINE 68: at the sound of those words; and Jo, after standing with a pale face for
LINE 69: a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and, throwing on
LINE 70: her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and, while
LINE 71: noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying
LINE 72: that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy
LINE 73: weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of
LINE 74: misery that Laurie asked quickly,--
LINE 75: "What is it? is Beth worse?"
LINE 76: "I've sent for mother," said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a
LINE 77: tragical expression.
LINE 78: "Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?" asked
LINE 79: Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair, and took off the rebellious
LINE 80: boots, seeing how her hands shook.
LINE 81: "No, the doctor told us to."
LINE 82: "O Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a startled face.
LINE 83: "Yes, it is; she doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the
LINE 84: flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine-leaves on the wall; she
LINE 85: doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it; mother
LINE 86: and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find Him."
LINE 87: As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her
LINE 88: hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie
LINE 89: took it in his, whispering, as well as he could, with a lump in his
LINE 90: throat,--
LINE 91: "I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"
LINE 92: She could not speak, but she did "hold on," and the warm grasp of the
LINE 93: friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her
LINE 94: nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.
LINE 95: Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting
LINE 96: words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as
LINE 97: her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done; far
LINE 98: more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken
LINE 99: sympathy, and, in the silence, learned the sweet solace which affection
LINE 100: administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her,
LINE 101: and looked up with a grateful face.
LINE 102: [Illustration: Gently stroking her head as her mother used to do]
LINE 103: "Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now; I don't feel so forlorn, and will try
LINE 104: to bear it if it comes."
LINE 105: "Keep hoping for the best; that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will
LINE 106: be here, and then everything will be right."
LINE 107: "I'm so glad father is better; now she won't feel so bad about leaving
LINE 108: him. Oh, me! it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I
LINE 109: got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo, spreading her wet
LINE 110: handkerchief over her knees to dry.
LINE 111: "Doesn't Meg pull fair?" asked Laurie, looking indignant.
LINE 112: "Oh, yes; she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do; and she won't
LINE 113: miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I _can't_ give her up. I
LINE 114: can't! I can't!"
LINE 115: Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried
LINE 116: despairingly; for she had kept up bravely till now, and never shed a
LINE 117: tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he
LINE 118: had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It
LINE 119: might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.
LINE 120: Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I don't think she
LINE 121: will die; she's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe
LINE 122: God will take her away yet."
LINE 123: "The good and dear people always do die," groaned Jo, but she stopped
LINE 124: crying, for her friend's words cheered her up, in spite of her own
LINE 125: doubts and fears.
LINE 126: "Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a
LINE 127: bit; I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."
LINE 128: Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down
LINE 129: on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the
LINE 130: table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the
LINE 131: submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo; and, when
LINE 132: Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile,
LINE 133: and said bravely, "I drink--Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor,
LINE 134: Teddy, and _such_ a comfortable friend; how can I ever pay you?" she
LINE 135: added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her
LINE 136: troubled mind.
LINE 137: "I'll send in my bill, by and by; and to-night I'll give you something
LINE 138: that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,"
LINE 139: said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at
LINE 140: something.
LINE 141: "What is it?" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute, in her wonder.
LINE 142: "I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come
LINE 143: at once, and she'll be here to-night, and everything will be all right.
LINE 144: Aren't you glad I did it?"
LINE 145: Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for
LINE 146: he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or
LINE 147: harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment
LINE 148: he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his
LINE 149: neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, "O Laurie! O mother! I _am_ so
LINE 150: glad!" She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled
LINE 151: and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden
LINE 152: news. Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of
LINE 153: mind; he patted her back soothingly, and, finding that she was
LINE 154: recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo
LINE 155: round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away,
LINE 156: saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't! I didn't mean to; it was dreadful of
LINE 157: me; but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I
LINE 158: couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me
LINE 159: wine again; it makes me act so."
LINE 160: "I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. "Why, you see I
LINE 161: got fidgety, and so did grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the
LINE 162: authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive
LINE 163: us if Beth--well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to
LINE 164: say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office
LINE 165: yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off
LINE 166: when I proposed a telegram. I never _can_ bear to be 'lorded over;' so
LINE 167: that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and
LINE 168: the late train is in at two, A.M. I shall go for her; and you've only
LINE 169: got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet, till that blessed
LINE 170: lady gets here."
LINE 171: "Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?"
LINE 172: "Fly at me again; I rather like it," said Laurie, looking
LINE 173: mischievous,--a thing he had not done for a fortnight.
LINE 174: "No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't
LINE 175: tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless you,
LINE 176: Teddy, bless you!"
LINE 177: Jo had backed into a corner; and, as she finished her speech, she
LINE 178: vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a
LINE 179: dresser, and told the assembled cats that she was "happy, oh, _so_
LINE 180: happy!" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made rather a neat
LINE 181: thing of it.
LINE 182: "That's the interferingest chap I ever see; but I forgive him, and do
LINE 183: hope Mrs. March is coming on right away," said Hannah, with an air of
LINE 184: relief, when Jo told the good news.
LINE 185: Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set
LINE 186: the sick-room in order, and Hannah "knocked up a couple of pies in case
LINE 187: of company unexpected." A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the
LINE 188: house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.
LINE 189: Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change; Beth's bird began to
LINE 190: chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the
LINE 191: window; the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness; and every time
LINE 192: the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one
LINE 193: another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear! mother's
LINE 194: coming!" Every one rejoiced but Beth; she lay in that heavy stupor,
LINE 195: alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous
LINE 196: sight,--the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so
LINE 197: weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty,
LINE 198: well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she
LINE 199: lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips so
LINE 200: parched they could hardly shape the word; all day Jo and Meg hovered
LINE 201: over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and mother; and
LINE 202: all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged
LINE 203: slowly by. But night came at last; and every time the clock struck, the
LINE 204: sisters, still sitting on either side the bed, looked at each other with
LINE 205: brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been
LINE 206: in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take
LINE 207: place about midnight, at which time he would return.
LINE 208: Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot, and fell
LINE 209: fast asleep; Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that
LINE 210: he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's anxious
LINE 211: countenance as she entered; Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest,
LINE 212: but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black
LINE 213: eyes beautifully soft and clear.
LINE 214: The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they
LINE 215: kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes
LINE 216: to us in hours like those.
LINE 217: "If God spares Beth I never will complain again," whispered Meg
LINE 218: earnestly.
LINE 219: "If God spares Beth I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,"
LINE 220: answered Jo, with equal fervor.
LINE 221: "I wish I had no heart, it aches so," sighed Meg, after a pause.
LINE 222: "If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get
LINE 223: through it," added her sister despondently.
LINE 224: Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching
LINE 225: Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was
LINE 226: still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep
LINE 227: hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale
LINE 228: shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and
LINE 229: nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.
LINE 230: Another hour,--still no one came; and anxious fears of delay in the
LINE 231: storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at
LINE 232: Washington, haunted the poor girls.
LINE 233: It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary
LINE 234: the world looked in its winding-sheet of snow, heard a movement by the
LINE 235: bed, and, turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's
LINE 236: easy-chair, with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo,
LINE 237: as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me."
LINE 238: She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great
LINE 239: change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain
LINE 240: were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in
LINE 241: its utter repose, that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning
LINE 242: low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with
LINE 243: her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, "Good-by, my Beth;
LINE 244: good-by!"
LINE 245: As if waked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the
LINE 246: bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then,
LINE 247: throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,
LINE 248: exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's turned; she's sleepin'
LINE 249: nat'ral; her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my
LINE 250: goodness me!"
LINE 251: Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to
LINE 252: confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite
LINE 253: heavenly when he smiled, and said, with a fatherly look at them, "Yes,
LINE 254: my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the
LINE 255: house quiet; let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her--"
LINE 256: What they were to give, neither heard; for both crept into the dark
LINE 257: hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with
LINE 258: hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled
LINE 259: by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her
LINE 260: cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing
LINE 261: quietly, as if just fallen asleep.
LINE 262: "If mother would only come now!" said Jo, as the winter night began to
LINE 263: wane.
LINE 264: "See," said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, "I thought
LINE 265: this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand to-morrow if she--went
LINE 266: away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put
LINE 267: it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she
LINE 268: sees will be the little rose, and mother's face."
LINE 269: Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed
LINE 270: so lovely, as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out
LINE 271: in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.
LINE 272: "It looks like a fairy world," said Meg, smiling to herself, as she
LINE 273: stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.
LINE 274: "Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.
LINE 275: Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,
LINE 276: and then Laurie's voice saying, in a joyful whisper, "Girls, she's come!
LINE 277: she's come!"
LINE 278: [Illustration: Amy's Will]
