LINE 1: "NEW YORK, November.
LINE 2: "DEAR MARMEE AND BETH,--
LINE 3: "I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to
LINE 4: tell, though I'm not a fine young lady travelling on the
LINE 5: continent. When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a
LINE 6: trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an
LINE 7: Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,
LINE 8: hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping
LINE 9: gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their
LINE 10: mouths to roar.
LINE 11: "Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared
LINE 12: up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.
LINE 13: "Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even
LINE 14: in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little
LINE 15: sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice
LINE 16: table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I
LINE 17: like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many
LINE 18: stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,
LINE 19: where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.
LINE 20: Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty
LINE 21: children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after
LINE 22: telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall
LINE 23: make a model governess.
LINE 24: "I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the
LINE 25: great table, and for the present I do, for I _am_ bashful,
LINE 26: though no one will believe it.
LINE 27: "'Now, my dear, make yourself at home,' said Mrs. K. in her
LINE 28: motherly way; 'I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you
LINE 29: may suppose with such a family; but a great anxiety will be off
LINE 30: my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are
LINE 31: always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I
LINE 32: can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you
LINE 33: feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if
LINE 34: anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the
LINE 35: tea-bell; I must run and change my cap;' and off she bustled,
LINE 36: leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.
LINE 37: "As I went downstairs, soon after, I saw something I liked. The
LINE 38: flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting
LINE 39: at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber
LINE 40: up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod
LINE 41: of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at
LINE 42: a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a
LINE 43: foreign accent,--
LINE 44: "'It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such
LINE 45: heaviness.'
LINE 46: "Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for, as father says,
LINE 47: trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that
LINE 48: evening, she laughed, and said,--
LINE 49: "'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things
LINE 50: of that sort.'
LINE 51: "Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but
LINE 52: poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and
LINE 53: two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according
LINE 54: to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very
LINE 55: romantic story, but it interested me; and I was glad to hear
LINE 56: that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.
LINE 57: There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to
LINE 58: peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost
LINE 59: forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.
LINE 60: "After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I
LINE 61: attacked the big work-basket, and had a quiet evening chatting
LINE 62: with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it
LINE 63: once a week; so good-night, and more to-morrow."
LINE 64: "_Tuesday Eve._
LINE 65: "Had a lively time in my seminary, this morning, for the
LINE 66: children acted like Sancho; and at one time I really thought I
LINE 67: should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try
LINE 68: gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and
LINE 69: keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,
LINE 70: and I went to my needle-work, like little Mabel, 'with a willing
LINE 71: mind.' I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice
LINE 72: button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one
LINE 73: began to hum,--
LINE 74: 'Kennst du das land,'
LINE 75: like a big bumble-bee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I
LINE 76: couldn't resist the temptation; and lifting one end of the
LINE 77: curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was
LINE 78: there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at
LINE 79: him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled
LINE 80: all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I
LINE 81: ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,
LINE 82: after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were
LINE 83: rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome
LINE 84: feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked
LINE 85: him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he
LINE 86: looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,
LINE 87: and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of
LINE 88: his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth
LINE 89: bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like
LINE 90: an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,
LINE 91: called out in a loud, brisk tone,--
LINE 92: "'Herein!'
LINE 93: "I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a
LINE 94: child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.
LINE 95: "'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and
LINE 96: running to meet him.
LINE 97: "'Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer; come, then, and take a goot hug from
LINE 98: him, my Tina,' said the Professor, catching her up, with a
LINE 99: laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to
LINE 100: stoop her little face to kiss him.
LINE 101: [Illustration: Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer]
LINE 102: "'Now me mus tuddy my lessin,' went on the funny little thing;
LINE 103: so he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she
LINE 104: had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled
LINE 105: away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat
LINE 106: finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I
LINE 107: nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood
LINE 108: stroking her pretty hair, with a fatherly look, that made me
LINE 109: think she must be his own, though she looked more French than
LINE 110: German.
LINE 111: "Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me
LINE 112: back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the
LINE 113: noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept
LINE 114: laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a
LINE 115: coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an
LINE 116: accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.
LINE 117: "Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I
LINE 118: heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not
LINE 119: attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he
LINE 120: struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing
LINE 121: exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'
LINE 122: "Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just
LINE 123: one more peep, to see if he survived it. He seemed to have
LINE 124: thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with
LINE 125: his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put
LINE 126: his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and,
LINE 127: taking little Tina, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, in his
LINE 128: arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of
LINE 129: it.
LINE 130: "Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock
LINE 131: dinner; and, feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,
LINE 132: just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.
LINE 133: So I made myself respectable, and tried to slip in behind Mrs.
LINE 134: Kirke; but as she is short, and I'm tall, my efforts at
LINE 135: concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her,
LINE 136: and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage, and looked
LINE 137: about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on
LINE 138: getting their dinner,--the gentlemen especially, who seemed to
LINE 139: be eating on time, for they _bolted_ in every sense of the word,
LINE 140: vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual
LINE 141: assortment of young men absorbed in themselves; young couples
LINE 142: absorbed in each other; married ladies in their babies, and old
LINE 143: gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much
LINE 144: to do with any of them, except one sweet-faced maiden lady, who
LINE 145: looks as if she had something in her.
LINE 146: "Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor,
LINE 147: shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf
LINE 148: old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a
LINE 149: Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she'd have turned
LINE 150: her back on him forever, because, sad to relate, he had a great
LINE 151: appetite, and shovelled in his dinner in a manner which would
LINE 152: have horrified 'her ladyship.' I didn't mind, for I like 'to see
LINE 153: folks eat with a relish,' as Hannah says, and the poor man must
LINE 154: have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.
LINE 155: "As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were
LINE 156: settling their hats before the hall-mirror, and I heard one say
LINE 157: low to the other, 'Who's the new party?'
LINE 158: "'Governess, or something of that sort.'
LINE 159: "'What the deuce is she at our table for?'
LINE 160: "'Friend of the old lady's.'
LINE 161: "'Handsome head, but no style.'
LINE 162: "'Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.'
LINE 163: "I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess
LINE 164: is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style,
LINE 165: which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of
LINE 166: the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad
LINE 167: chimneys. I hate ordinary people!"
LINE 168: "_Thursday._
LINE 169: "Yesterday was a quiet day, spent in teaching, sewing, and
LINE 170: writing in my little room, which is very cosey, with a light and
LINE 171: fire. I picked up a few bits of news, and was introduced to the
LINE 172: Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman
LINE 173: who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing
LINE 174: has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house
LINE 175: like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is
LINE 176: very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore.' Kitty and Minnie
LINE 177: Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of
LINE 178: stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and
LINE 179: the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems,
LINE 180: call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner
LINE 181: of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. K. says,
LINE 182: and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him, in spite
LINE 183: of his foreign ways.
LINE 184: "The maiden lady is a Miss Norton,--rich, cultivated, and kind.
LINE 185: She spoke to me at dinner to-day (for I went to table again,
LINE 186: it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her
LINE 187: at her room. She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting
LINE 188: persons, and seems friendly; so I shall make myself agreeable,
LINE 189: for I _do_ want to get into good society, only it isn't the same
LINE 190: sort that Amy likes.
LINE 191: "I was in our parlor last evening, when Mr. Bhaer came in with
LINE 192: some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie,
LINE 193: who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: 'This is
LINE 194: mamma's friend, Miss March.'
LINE 195: "'Yes; and she's jolly and we like her lots,' added Kitty, who
LINE 196: is an _enfant terrible_.
LINE 197: "We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction
LINE 198: and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.
LINE 199: "'Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.
LINE 200: If so again, call at me and I come,' he said, with a threatening
LINE 201: frown that delighted the little wretches.
LINE 202: "I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was
LINE 203: doomed to see a good deal of him, for to-day, as I passed his
LINE 204: door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my
LINE 205: umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown,
LINE 206: with a big blue sock on one hand, and a darning-needle in the
LINE 207: other; he didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained
LINE 208: and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his
LINE 209: loud, cheerful way,--
LINE 210: [Illustration: He waved his hand, sock and all]
LINE 211: "'You haf a fine day to make your walk. _Bon voyage,
LINE 212: mademoiselle._'
LINE 213: "I laughed all the way downstairs; but it was a little pathetic,
LINE 214: also, to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.
LINE 215: The German gentlemen embroider, I know; but darning hose is
LINE 216: another thing, and not so pretty."
LINE 217: "_Saturday._
LINE 218: "Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss
LINE 219: Norton, who has a room full of lovely things, and who was very
LINE 220: charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I
LINE 221: would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her
LINE 222: escort,--if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure
LINE 223: Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of
LINE 224: kindness to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from
LINE 225: such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.
LINE 226: "When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the
LINE 227: parlor that I looked in; and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his
LINE 228: hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a
LINE 229: jump-rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seed-cakes, as
LINE 230: they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.
LINE 231: "'We are playing _nargerie_,' explained Kitty.
LINE 232: "'Dis is mine effalunt!' added Tina, holding on by the
LINE 233: Professor's hair.
LINE 234: [Illustration: Dis is mine effalunt]
LINE 235: "'Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon,
LINE 236: when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?' said
LINE 237: Minnie.
LINE 238: "The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of
LINE 239: them, and said soberly to me,--
LINE 240: "'I gif you my wort it is so. If we make too large a noise you
LINE 241: shall say "Hush!" to us, and we go more softly.'
LINE 242: "I promised to do so, but left the door open, and enjoyed the
LINE 243: fun as much as they did,--for a more glorious frolic I never
LINE 244: witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sung, and
LINE 245: when it began to grow dark they all piled on to the sofa about
LINE 246: the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the
LINE 247: storks on the chimney-tops, and the little 'kobolds,' who ride
LINE 248: the snow-flakes as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple
LINE 249: and natural as Germans, don't you?
LINE 250: "I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if
LINE 251: motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin
LINE 252: paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this
LINE 253: long letter will need. Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can
LINE 254: spare them. My small news will sound very flat after her
LINE 255: splendors, but you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so
LINE 256: hard that he can't find time to write to his friends? Take good
LINE 257: care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and
LINE 258: give heaps of love to every one.
LINE 259: "From your faithful JO.
LINE 260: "P. S. On reading over my letter it strikes me as rather Bhaery;
LINE 261: but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had
LINE 262: nothing else to write about. Bless you!"
LINE 263: "DECEMBER.
LINE 264: "MY PRECIOUS BETSEY,--
LINE 265: "As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to
LINE 266: you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings
LINE 267: on; for, though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh,
LINE 268: be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the
LINE 269: way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to
LINE 270: shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not
LINE 271: so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by
LINE 272: them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little
LINE 273: lads, quite after my own heart; for the mixture of German and
LINE 274: American spirit in them produces a constant state of
LINE 275: effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether
LINE 276: spent in the house or out; for on pleasant days they all go to
LINE 277: walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep
LINE 278: order; and then such fun!
LINE 279: "We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I
LINE 280: really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll
LINE 281: way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke
LINE 282: called to me, one day, as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room, where she
LINE 283: was rummaging.
LINE 284: "'Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me
LINE 285: put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside
LINE 286: down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new
LINE 287: handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.'
LINE 288: "I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was 'a
LINE 289: den,' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere; a broken
LINE 290: meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done
LINE 291: with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one
LINE 292: window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;
LINE 293: half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the
LINE 294: manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;
LINE 295: and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave
LINE 296: of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand
LINE 297: rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the
LINE 298: bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having
LINE 299: been used as a holder.
LINE 300: "'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the
LINE 301: relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig
LINE 302: ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,
LINE 303: but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,
LINE 304: he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his
LINE 305: washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I
LINE 306: forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'
LINE 307: "'Let me mend them,' said I. 'I don't mind it, and he needn't
LINE 308: know. I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters
LINE 309: and lending books.'
LINE 310: "So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two
LINE 311: pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his
LINE 312: queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it
LINE 313: out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the
LINE 314: lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much
LINE 315: that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving
LINE 316: the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this
LINE 317: door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what
LINE 318: he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had
LINE 319: gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was
LINE 320: busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most
LINE 321: absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was
LINE 322: Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to
LINE 323: Tina not to betray him.
LINE 324: "'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep
LINE 325: at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not
LINE 326: pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'
LINE 327: "'Yes; but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,' I
LINE 328: blundered out, as red as a peony.
LINE 329: "'Prut! we will make the time, and we fail not to find the
LINE 330: sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much
LINE 331: gladness; for, look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay,'
LINE 332: and he pointed to my work. 'Yes, they say to one another, these
LINE 333: so kind ladies, "he is a stupid old fellow; he will see not what
LINE 334: we do; he will never opserve that his sock-heels go not in holes
LINE 335: any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,
LINE 336: and believe that strings make theirselves." Ah! but I haf an
LINE 337: eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel the thanks for
LINE 338: this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or no more good fairy
LINE 339: works for me and mine.'
LINE 340: "Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really
LINE 341: is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I
LINE 342: took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.
LINE 343: The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been
LINE 344: torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an
LINE 345: expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether
LINE 346: to laugh or cry. I tried both ways; and when it came to a sniff
LINE 347: of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to
LINE 348: the floor, and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced
LINE 349: and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was
LINE 350: scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and
LINE 351: shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if
LINE 352: I'd covered myself with glory.
LINE 353: "'Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant
LINE 354: little Märchen together, and dig no more in that dry book, that
LINE 355: goes in the corner for making us trouble.'
LINE 356: "He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersen's fairy tales so
LINE 357: invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and
LINE 358: went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to
LINE 359: amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away
LINE 360: (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over
LINE 361: long words, pronouncing according to the inspiration of the
LINE 362: minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first
LINE 363: page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried
LINE 364: out, in his hearty way, 'Das ist gute! Now we go well! My turn.
LINE 365: I do him in German; gif me your ear.' And away he went, rumbling
LINE 366: out the words with his strong voice, and a relish which was good
LINE 367: to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was the 'Constant
LINE 368: Tin Soldier,' which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,--and I
LINE 369: did,--though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't
LINE 370: help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so
LINE 371: comical.
LINE 372: "After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty
LINE 373: well; for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the
LINE 374: grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills
LINE 375: in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it
LINE 376: yet,--which is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to give him
LINE 377: something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me
LINE 378: something nice, Marmee.
LINE 379: "I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up
LINE 380: smoking, and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better
LINE 381: than I did. I'm not jealous, dear; do your best, only don't make
LINE 382: a saint of him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice
LINE 383: of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven't
LINE 384: time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven
LINE 385: Beth continues so comfortable."
LINE 386: "JANUARY.
LINE 387: "A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course
LINE 388: includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't
LINE 389: tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't
LINE 390: get it till night, and had given up hoping. Your letter came in
LINE 391: the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it
LINE 392: for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of a
LINE 393: feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my
LINE 394: mind, as I sat up in my room, after tea; and when the big,
LINE 395: muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged
LINE 396: it, and pranced. It was so _homey_ and refreshing, that I sat
LINE 397: down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and
LINE 398: cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I
LINE 399: wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought.
LINE 400: Beth's new 'ink-bib' was capital; and Hannah's box of hard
LINE 401: gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice
LINE 402: flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books father
LINE 403: has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!
LINE 404: [Illustration: I sat down upon the floor and read and looked and ate]
LINE 405: "Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that
LINE 406: line for, on New Year's Day, Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine
LINE 407: Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I've often admired
LINE 408: it, set up in the place of honor, with his German Bible, Plato,
LINE 409: Homer, and Milton; so you may imagine how I felt when he
LINE 410: brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my name in
LINE 411: it, 'from my friend Friedrich Bhaer.'
LINE 412: "'You say often you wish a library: here I gif you one; for
LINE 413: between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read
LINE 414: him well, and he will help you much; for the study of character
LINE 415: in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it
LINE 416: with your pen.'
LINE 417: "I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about 'my
LINE 418: library,' as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much
LINE 419: there was in Shakespeare before; but then I never had a Bhaer to
LINE 420: explain it to me. Now _don't_ laugh at his horrid name; it isn't
LINE 421: pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people _will_ say it, but
LINE 422: something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I'm glad
LINE 423: you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you will know
LINE 424: him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, father his
LINE 425: wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new 'friend
LINE 426: Friedrich Bhaer.'
LINE 427: "Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got several
LINE 428: little things, and put them about the room, where he would find
LINE 429: them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny,--a new
LINE 430: standish on his table, a little vase for his flower,--he always
LINE 431: has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he
LINE 432: says,--and a holder for his blower, so that he needn't burn up
LINE 433: what Amy calls 'mouchoirs.' I made it like those Beth
LINE 434: invented,--a big butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow
LINE 435: wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy
LINE 436: immensely, and he put it on his mantel-piece as an article of
LINE 437: _vertu_; so it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he
LINE 438: didn't forget a servant or a child in the house; and not a soul
LINE 439: here, from the French laundry-woman to Miss Norton, forgot him.
LINE 440: I was so glad of that.
LINE 441: "They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I
LINE 442: didn't mean to go down, having no dress; but at the last minute,
LINE 443: Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me
LINE 444: lace and feathers; so I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed
LINE 445: in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and
LINE 446: no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think
LINE 447: I am very stiff and cool, most of them; and so I am to
LINE 448: whipper-snappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a
LINE 449: 'nice derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of
LINE 450: the Nile.' I enjoyed it very much; and when we unmasked, it was
LINE 451: fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell
LINE 452: another that he knew I'd been an actress; in fact, he thought he
LINE 453: remembered seeing me at one of the minor theatres. Meg will
LINE 454: relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was
LINE 455: Titania,--a perfect little fairy in his arms. To see them dance
LINE 456: was 'quite a landscape,' to use a Teddyism.
LINE 457: "I had a very happy New Year, after all; and when I thought it
LINE 458: over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite
LINE 459: of my many failures; for I'm cheerful all the time now, work
LINE 460: with a will, and take more interest in other people than I used
LINE 461: to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your loving
LINE 462: JO."
