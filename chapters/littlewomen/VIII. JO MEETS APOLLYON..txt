LINE 1: "Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their room one
LINE 2: Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out, with an
LINE 3: air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.
LINE 4: "Never mind; little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned Jo sharply.
LINE 5: Now if there _is_ anything mortifying to our feelings, when we are
LINE 6: young, it is to be told that; and to be bidden to "run away, dear," is
LINE 7: still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined
LINE 8: to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who
LINE 9: never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, "Do tell me! I
LINE 10: should think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her
LINE 11: piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely."
LINE 12: "I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg; but Jo broke in
LINE 13: impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will spoil it all. You can't
LINE 14: go, Amy; so don't be a baby, and whine about it."
LINE 15: "You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were
LINE 16: whispering and laughing together, on the sofa, last night, and you
LINE 17: stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?"
LINE 18: "Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering."
LINE 19: Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her
LINE 20: pocket.
LINE 21: "I know! I know! you're going to the theatre to see the 'Seven
LINE 22: Castles!'" she cried; adding resolutely, "and I _shall_ go, for mother
LINE 23: said I might see it; and I've got my rag-money, and it was mean not to
LINE 24: tell me in time."
LINE 25: "Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child," said Meg soothingly.
LINE 26: "Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well
LINE 27: enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go
LINE 28: with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time."
LINE 29: "I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let
LINE 30: me; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for
LINE 31: some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good," pleaded Amy, looking as
LINE 32: pathetic as she could.
LINE 33: "Suppose we take her. I don't believe mother would mind, if we bundle
LINE 34: her up well," began Meg.
LINE 35: "If _she_ goes _I_ sha'n't; and if I don't, Laurie won't like it; and it
LINE 36: will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I
LINE 37: should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted," said Jo
LINE 38: crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,
LINE 39: when she wanted to enjoy herself.
LINE 40: Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,
LINE 41: in her most aggravating way, "I _shall_ go; Meg says I may; and if I pay
LINE 42: for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."
LINE 43: "You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit
LINE 44: alone; so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our
LINE 45: pleasure; or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper, when
LINE 46: you weren't asked. You sha'n't stir a step; so you may just stay where
LINE 47: you are," scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger
LINE 48: in her hurry.
LINE 49: Sitting on the floor, with one boot on, Amy began to cry, and Meg to
LINE 50: reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls
LINE 51: hurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot
LINE 52: her grown-up ways, and acted like a spoilt child. Just as the party was
LINE 53: setting out, Amy called over the banisters, in a threatening tone,
LINE 54: "You'll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if you ain't."
LINE 55: "Fiddlesticks!" returned Jo, slamming the door.
LINE 56: They had a charming time, for "The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake"
LINE 57: were as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of
LINE 58: the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes and
LINE 59: princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it; the fairy
LINE 60: queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy; and between the acts she
LINE 61: amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her
LINE 62: "sorry for it." She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course
LINE 63: of their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent
LINE 64: when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and
LINE 65: semi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed
LINE 66: afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had
LINE 67: hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting
LINE 68: her into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly
LINE 69: confessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better. Her
LINE 70: sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,
LINE 71: because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be
LINE 72: good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her;
LINE 73: and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.
LINE 74: When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an
LINE 75: injured air as they came in; never lifted her eyes from her book, or
LINE 76: asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered
LINE 77: resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire, and receive a glowing
LINE 78: description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's
LINE 79: first look was toward the bureau; for, in their last quarrel, Amy had
LINE 80: soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the
LINE 81: floor. Everything was in its place, however; and after a hasty glance
LINE 82: into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
LINE 83: forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.
LINE 84: There Jo was mistaken; for next day she made a discovery which produced
LINE 85: a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the
LINE 86: afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited, and demanding
LINE 87: breathlessly, "Has any one taken my book?"
LINE 88: Meg and Beth said "No," at once, and looked surprised; Amy poked the
LINE 89: fire, and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise, and was down upon her in
LINE 90: a minute.
LINE 91: "Amy, you've got it?"
LINE 92: "No, I haven't."
LINE 93: "You know where it is, then?"
LINE 94: "No, I don't."
LINE 95: "That's a fib!" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking
LINE 96: fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.
LINE 97: "It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't
LINE 98: care."
LINE 99: "You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll
LINE 100: make you," and Jo gave her a slight shake.
LINE 101: "Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book again,"
LINE 102: cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.
LINE 103: "Why not?"
LINE 104: "I burnt it up."
LINE 105: [Illustration: I burnt it up]
LINE 106: "What! my little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to
LINE 107: finish before father got home? Have you really burnt it?" said Jo,
LINE 108: turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy
LINE 109: nervously.
LINE 110: "Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,
LINE 111: and I have, so--"
LINE 112: Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy
LINE 113: till her teeth chattered in her head; crying, in a passion of grief and
LINE 114: anger,--
LINE 115: "You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never
LINE 116: forgive you as long as I live."
LINE 117: Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside
LINE 118: herself; and, with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of
LINE 119: the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.
LINE 120: The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard
LINE 121: the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her
LINE 122: sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her
LINE 123: family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen
LINE 124: little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her
LINE 125: whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to
LINE 126: print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the
LINE 127: old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of
LINE 128: several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a
LINE 129: dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.
LINE 130: Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her
LINE 131: pet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would
LINE 132: love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted
LINE 133: more than any of them.
LINE 134: When the tea-bell rung, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable
LINE 135: that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly,--
LINE 136: "Please forgive me, Jo; I'm very, very sorry."
LINE 137: "I never shall forgive you," was Jo's stern answer; and, from that
LINE 138: moment, she ignored Amy entirely.
LINE 139: No one spoke of the great trouble,--not even Mrs. March,--for all had
LINE 140: learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted;
LINE 141: and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own
LINE 142: generous nature, softened Jo's resentment, and healed the breach. It was
LINE 143: not a happy evening; for, though they sewed as usual, while their mother
LINE 144: read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and
LINE 145: the sweet home-peace was disturbed. They felt this most when
LINE 146: singing-time came; for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone,
LINE 147: and Amy broke down, so Meg and mother sung alone. But, in spite of their
LINE 148: efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flute-like voices did not seem to
LINE 149: chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.
LINE 150: As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,--
LINE 151: "My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other,
LINE 152: help each other, and begin again to-morrow."
LINE 153: Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief
LINE 154: and anger all away; but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so
LINE 155: deeply injured that she really _couldn't_ quite forgive yet. So she
LINE 156: winked hard, shook her head, and said, gruffly because Amy was
LINE 157: listening,--
LINE 158: "It was an abominable thing, and she don't deserve to be forgiven."
LINE 159: With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential
LINE 160: gossip that night.
LINE 161: Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and
LINE 162: began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than
LINE 163: ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was
LINE 164: particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder-cloud, and
LINE 165: nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning; she
LINE 166: dropped her precious turn-over in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack
LINE 167: of fidgets, Meg was pensive, Beth _would_ look grieved and wistful when
LINE 168: she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always
LINE 169: talking about being good, and yet wouldn't try, when other people set
LINE 170: them a virtuous example.
LINE 171: "Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always
LINE 172: kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know," said Jo to herself,
LINE 173: and off she went.
LINE 174: Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient
LINE 175: exclamation,--
LINE 176: "There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we
LINE 177: shall have. But it's no use to ask such a cross-patch to take me."
LINE 178: "Don't say that; you _were_ very naughty, and it _is_ hard to forgive
LINE 179: the loss of her precious little book; but I think she might do it now,
LINE 180: and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute," said Meg. "Go
LINE 181: after them; don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,
LINE 182: then take a quiet minute, and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and
LINE 183: I'm sure she'll be friends again, with all her heart."
LINE 184: "I'll try," said Amy, for the advice suited her; and, after a flurry to
LINE 185: get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over
LINE 186: the hill.
LINE 187: It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached
LINE 188: them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back; Laurie did not see, for he
LINE 189: was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm
LINE 190: spell had preceded the cold snap.
LINE 191: "I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right, before we
LINE 192: begin to race," Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young
LINE 193: Russian, in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.
LINE 194: Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her
LINE 195: fingers, as she tried to put her skates on; but Jo never turned, and
LINE 196: went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of
LINE 197: satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till
LINE 198: it grew strong, and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and
LINE 199: feelings always do, unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,
LINE 200: he shouted back,--
LINE 201: "Keep near the shore; it isn't safe in the middle."
LINE 202: Jo heard, but Amy was just struggling to her feet, and did not catch a
LINE 203: word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was
LINE 204: harboring said in her ear,--
LINE 205: "No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself."
LINE 206: Laurie had vanished round the bend; Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,
LINE 207: far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the
LINE 208: river. For a minute Jo stood still, with a strange feeling at her heart;
LINE 209: then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round,
LINE 210: just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with the sudden
LINE 211: crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart
LINE 212: stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone;
LINE 213: she tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in
LINE 214: them; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring, with
LINE 215: a terror-stricken face, at the little blue hood above the black water.
LINE 216: Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out,--
LINE 217: "Bring a rail; quick, quick!"
LINE 218: How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked
LINE 219: as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,
LINE 220: and, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a
LINE 221: rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more
LINE 222: frightened than hurt.
LINE 223: [Illustration: Held Amy up by his arms and hockey]
LINE 224: "Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on
LINE 225: her, while I get off these confounded skates," cried Laurie, wrapping
LINE 226: his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which never seemed
LINE 227: so intricate before.
LINE 228: Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home; and, after an
LINE 229: exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets, before a hot
LINE 230: fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken; but flown about, looking
LINE 231: pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands
LINE 232: cut and bruised by ice and rails, and refractory buckles. When Amy was
LINE 233: comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed,
LINE 234: she called Jo to her, and began to bind up the hurt hands.
LINE 235: "Are you sure she is safe?" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the
LINE 236: golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever
LINE 237: under the treacherous ice.
LINE 238: "Quite safe, dear; she is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,
LINE 239: you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly," replied
LINE 240: her mother cheerfully.
LINE 241: "Laurie did it all; I only let her go. Mother, if she _should_ die, it
LINE 242: would be my fault"; and Jo dropped down beside the bed, in a passion of
LINE 243: penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her
LINE 244: hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the
LINE 245: heavy punishment which might have come upon her.
LINE 246: "It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it
LINE 247: breaks out worse than ever. O mother, what shall I do? what shall I do?"
LINE 248: cried poor Jo, in despair.
LINE 249: "Watch and pray, dear; never get tired of trying; and never think it is
LINE 250: impossible to conquer your fault," said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy
LINE 251: head to her shoulder, and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo
LINE 252: cried harder than ever.
LINE 253: "You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could
LINE 254: do anything when I'm in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt any
LINE 255: one, and enjoy it. I'm afraid I _shall_ do something dreadful some day,
LINE 256: and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. O mother, help me, do
LINE 257: help me!"
LINE 258: "I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this day,
LINE 259: and resolve, with all your soul, that you will never know another like
LINE 260: it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours,
LINE 261: and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your
LINE 262: temper is the worst in the world; but mine used to be just like it."
LINE 263: "Yours, mother? Why, you are never angry!" and, for the moment, Jo
LINE 264: forgot remorse in surprise.
LINE 265: "I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in
LINE 266: controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have
LINE 267: learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though
LINE 268: it may take me another forty years to do so."
LINE 269: The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better
LINE 270: lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt
LINE 271: comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her; the
LINE 272: knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,
LINE 273: made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it;
LINE 274: though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray, to a
LINE 275: girl of fifteen.
LINE 276: "Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together, and go
LINE 277: out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds, or people worry
LINE 278: you?" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever
LINE 279: before.
LINE 280: "Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips; and
LINE 281: when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away
LINE 282: a minute, and give myself a little shake, for being so weak and wicked,"
LINE 283: answered Mrs. March, with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and
LINE 284: fastened up Jo's dishevelled hair.
LINE 285: "How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me--for the
LINE 286: sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about; and the more I say the
LINE 287: worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings, and say
LINE 288: dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear."
LINE 289: "My good mother used to help me--"
LINE 290: "As you do us--" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.
LINE 291: "But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years
LINE 292: had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to
LINE 293: any one else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears
LINE 294: over my failures; for, in spite of my efforts, I never seemed to get on.
LINE 295: Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be
LINE 296: good. But by and by, when I had four little daughters round me, and we
LINE 297: were poor, then the old trouble began again; for I am not patient by
LINE 298: nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything."
LINE 299: "Poor mother! what helped you then?"
LINE 300: "Your father, Jo. He never loses patience,--never doubts or
LINE 301: complains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that
LINE 302: one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me,
LINE 303: and showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have
LINE 304: my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try
LINE 305: for your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of
LINE 306: you, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have
LINE 307: done; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the
LINE 308: sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would
LINE 309: have them copy."
LINE 310: "O mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied," cried
LINE 311: Jo, much touched.
LINE 312: "I hope you will be a great deal better, dear; but you must keep watch
LINE 313: over your 'bosom enemy,' as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not
LINE 314: spoil your life. You have had a warning; remember it, and try with heart
LINE 315: and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater
LINE 316: sorrow and regret than you have known to-day."
LINE 317: "I will try, mother; I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and
LINE 318: keep me from flying out. I used to see father sometimes put his finger
LINE 319: on his lips, and look at you with a very kind, but sober face, and you
LINE 320: always folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?"
LINE 321: asked Jo softly.
LINE 322: "Yes; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me
LINE 323: from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look."
LINE 324: Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled, as she
LINE 325: spoke; and, fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,
LINE 326: "Was it wrong to watch you, and to speak of it? I didn't mean to be
LINE 327: rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so
LINE 328: safe and happy here."
LINE 329: "My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest
LINE 330: happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me, and know how
LINE 331: much I love them."
LINE 332: "I thought I'd grieved you."
LINE 333: "No, dear; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him, how
LINE 334: much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his
LINE 335: little daughters safe and good for him."
LINE 336: "Yet you told him to go, mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never
LINE 337: complain now, or seem as if you needed any help," said Jo, wondering.
LINE 338: "I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was
LINE 339: gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and
LINE 340: will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't seem to need
LINE 341: help, it is because I have a better friend, even than father, to comfort
LINE 342: and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are
LINE 343: beginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if
LINE 344: you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as
LINE 345: you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the
LINE 346: nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power
LINE 347: and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken
LINE 348: from you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and
LINE 349: strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little
LINE 350: cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as
LINE 351: you come to your mother."
LINE 352: Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and, in the silence which
LINE 353: followed, the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart
LINE 354: without words; for in that sad, yet happy hour, she had learned not only
LINE 355: the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial
LINE 356: and self-control; and, led by her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to
LINE 357: the Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of
LINE 358: any father, tenderer than that of any mother.
LINE 359: Amy stirred, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eager to begin at once
LINE 360: to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it
LINE 361: had never worn before.
LINE 362: "I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn't forgive her, and to-day,
LINE 363: if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I
LINE 364: be so wicked?" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister,
