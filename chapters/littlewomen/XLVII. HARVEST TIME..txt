LINE 1: For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met
LINE 2: occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the
LINE 3: price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began
LINE 4: rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March
LINE 5: died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over,--for they loved the
LINE 6: old lady in spite of her sharp tongue,--they found they had cause for
LINE 7: rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of
LINE 8: joyful things possible.
LINE 9: "It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum; for of course you
LINE 10: intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter
LINE 11: over, some weeks later.
LINE 12: "No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,
LINE 13: whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.
LINE 14: "You don't mean to live there?"
LINE 15: "Yes, I do."
LINE 16: "But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of
LINE 17: money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or
LINE 18: three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it."
LINE 19: "He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."
LINE 20: "And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds
LINE 21: paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."
LINE 22: "The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one;" and Jo laughed.
LINE 23: "Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"
LINE 24: "Boys. I want to open a school for little lads,--a good, happy, homelike
LINE 25: school, with me to take care of them, and Fritz to teach them."
LINE 26: "There's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?" cried
LINE 27: Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.
LINE 28: "I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.
LINE 29: "So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for
LINE 30: trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.
LINE 31: "It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking the head of her
LINE 32: one all-absorbing son.
LINE 33: "Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us all
LINE 34: about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a
LINE 35: hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.
LINE 36: "I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,
LINE 37: though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she
LINE 38: speaks. Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly, "just understand
LINE 39: that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long-cherished plan. Before my
LINE 40: Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no one
LINE 41: needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn
LINE 42: little lads, who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and make
LINE 43: life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin,
LINE 44: for want of help at the right minute; I love so to do anything for them;
LINE 45: I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and, oh,
LINE 46: I should _so_ like to be a mother to them!"
LINE 47: Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in
LINE 48: her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not
LINE 49: seen for a long while.
LINE 50: "I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would
LINE 51: like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he's
LINE 52: been doing it all his life,--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting
LINE 53: rich; that he'll never be; money doesn't stay in his pocket long enough
LINE 54: to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better
LINE 55: than I ever deserved, _I'm_ rich, at least I feel so, and we can live at
LINE 56: Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It's just the
LINE 57: place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.
LINE 58: There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.
LINE 59: They could help in the garden and orchard: such work is healthy, isn't
LINE 60: it, sir? Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way, and father will
LINE 61: help him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them; and mother will
LINE 62: be my stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had
LINE 63: enough; now I can fill the house full, and revel in the little dears to
LINE 64: my heart's content. Think what luxury,--Plumfield my own, and a
LINE 65: wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!"
LINE 66: As Jo waved her hands, and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off
LINE 67: into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought
LINE 68: he'd have an apoplectic fit.
LINE 69: "I don't see anything funny," she said gravely, when she could be heard.
LINE 70: "Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a
LINE 71: school, and for me to prefer to reside on my own estate."
LINE 72: "She is putting on airs already," said Laurie, who regarded the idea in
LINE 73: the light of a capital joke. "But may I inquire how you intend to
LINE 74: support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I'm
LINE 75: afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer."
LINE 76: "Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils,
LINE 77: also,--perhaps begin with such altogether; then, when I've got a start,
LINE 78: I can take a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people's
LINE 79: children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've seen
LINE 80: unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed
LINE 81: forward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagement
LINE 82: or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get
LINE 83: through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they need most
LINE 84: patience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try
LINE 85: to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn, all at once, from
LINE 86: pretty children into fine young men. They don't complain much,--plucky
LINE 87: little souls,--but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and
LINE 88: I know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and
LINE 89: like to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys'
LINE 90: hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.
LINE 91: I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride
LINE 92: and honor to his family?"
LINE 93: "I'll testify that you tried to do it," said Laurie, with a grateful
LINE 94: look.
LINE 95: "And I've succeeded beyond my hopes; for here you are, a steady,
LINE 96: sensible business man, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying
LINE 97: up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely
LINE 98: a business man: you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself,
LINE 99: and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I _am_
LINE 100: proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and every one feels
LINE 101: it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock,
LINE 102: I'll just point to you, and say, 'There's your model, my lads.'"
LINE 103: Poor Laurie didn't know where to look; for, man though he was, something
LINE 104: of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all
LINE 105: faces turn approvingly upon him.
LINE 106: "I say, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his old boyish
LINE 107: way. "You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,
LINE 108: except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me
LINE 109: off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I've
LINE 110: got on at all, you may thank these two for it;" and he laid one hand
LINE 111: gently on his grandfather's white head, the other on Amy's golden one,
LINE 112: for the three were never far apart.
LINE 113: "I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the
LINE 114: world!" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind
LINE 115: just then. "When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the
LINE 116: three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it
LINE 117: would be quite a little heaven on earth," she added more quietly. And
LINE 118: that night, when she went to her room, after a blissful evening of
LINE 119: family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness
LINE 120: that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near
LINE 121: her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.
LINE 122: It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen
LINE 123: in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew
LINE 124: where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a
LINE 125: family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished
LINE 126: surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich; for Mr. Laurence was
LINE 127: continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the
LINE 128: Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for
LINE 129: its support. In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and
LINE 130: furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.
LINE 131: Of course it was up-hill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes; but
LINE 132: the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most
LINE 133: rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her
LINE 134: "wilderness of boys," and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented
LINE 135: had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered
LINE 136: Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of
LINE 137: poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror
LINE 138: of the boys for miles round; and now the exiles feasted freely on
LINE 139: forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and
LINE 140: played cricket in the big field where the irritable "cow with a crumpled
LINE 141: horn" used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort
LINE 142: of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the
LINE 143: "Bhaer-garten," as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its
LINE 144: inhabitants.
LINE 145: It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a
LINE 146: fortune; but it _was_ just what Jo intended it to be,--"a happy,
LINE 147: homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness."
LINE 148: Every room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the
LINE 149: garden soon had its owner; a regular menagerie appeared in barn and
LINE 150: shed, for pet animals were allowed; and, three times a day, Jo smiled at
LINE 151: her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows
LINE 152: of happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes,
LINE 153: confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for "Mother Bhaer."
LINE 154: She had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not
LINE 155: angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and
LINE 156: Professorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot
LINE 157: which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing
LINE 158: little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and, in time, success; for
LINE 159: no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as
LINE 160: benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times
LINE 161: seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads; their
LINE 162: penitent sniffs and whispers after wrong-doing; their droll or touching
LINE 163: little confidences; their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even
LINE 164: their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.
LINE 165: There were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys;
LINE 166: boys that lisped and boys that stuttered; one or two lame ones; and a
LINE 167: merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was
LINE 168: welcome to the "Bhaer-garten," though some people predicted that his
LINE 169: admission would ruin the school.
LINE 170: Yes; Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much
LINE 171: anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily, and found the
LINE 172: applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world; for
LINE 173: now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers
LINE 174: and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to
LINE 175: increase her happiness,--Rob, named for grandpa, and Teddy, a
LINE 176: happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny
LINE 177: temper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up
LINE 178: alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and
LINE 179: aunts; but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough
LINE 180: nurses loved and served them well.
LINE 181: There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most
LINE 182: delightful was the yearly apple-picking; for then the Marches,
LINE 183: Laurences, Brookes, and Bhaers turned out in full force, and made a day
LINE 184: of it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals
LINE 185: occurred,--a mellow October day, when the air was full of an
LINE 186: exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise, and the blood dance
LINE 187: healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire;
LINE 188: golden-rod and asters fringed the mossy walls; grasshoppers skipped
LINE 189: briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a
LINE 190: feast; squirrels were busy with their small harvesting; birds twittered
LINE 191: their adieux from the alders in the lane; and every tree stood ready to
LINE 192: send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake.
LINE 193: Everybody was there; everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled
LINE 194: down; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or
LINE 195: such a jolly set to enjoy it; and every one gave themselves up to the
LINE 196: simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things
LINE 197: as care or sorrow in the world.
LINE 198: Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella
LINE 199: to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying--
LINE 200: "The gentle apple's winey juice."
LINE 201: The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic
LINE 202: knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook
LINE 203: and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of
LINE 204: ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones,
LINE 205: rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among the
LINE 206: birds' nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs.
LINE 207: March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting
LINE 208: the contributions that kept pouring in; while Amy, with a beautiful
LINE 209: motherly expression in her face, sketched the various groups, and
LINE 210: watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch
LINE 211: beside him.
LINE 212: Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned
LINE 213: up, her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her arm,
LINE 214: ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a
LINE 215: charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any
LINE 216: anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on
LINE 217: the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent
LINE 218: papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest
LINE 219: anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small
LINE 220: shoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and
LINE 221: rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty
LINE 222: welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.
LINE 223: [Illustration: Teddy bore a charmed life]
LINE 224: At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the
LINE 225: apple-pickers rested, and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg,
LINE 226: with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass,
LINE 227: for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land
LINE 228: literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads
LINE 229: were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment
LINE 230: as they liked,--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul.
LINE 231: They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for
LINE 232: some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on
LINE 233: their heads, others lent a charm to leap-frog by eating pie in the
LINE 234: pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and
LINE 235: apple-turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The
LINE 236: little girls had a private tea-party, and Ted roved among the edibles at
LINE 237: his own sweet will.
LINE 238: When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular
LINE 239: toast, which was always drunk at such times,--"Aunt March, God bless
LINE 240: her!" A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much
LINE 241: he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to
LINE 242: keep her memory green.
LINE 243: "Now, grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times
LINE 244: three!"
LINE 245: That was given with a will, as you may well believe; and the cheering
LINE 246: once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed,
LINE 247: from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the
LINE 248: astonished guinea-pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search
LINE 249: of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the
LINE 250: queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were
LINE 251: transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some
LINE 252: of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments
LINE 253: to grandma's,--for the children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch
LINE 254: Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed
LINE 255: was better than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi's shoe-box was a miracle
LINE 256: of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut; Rob's footstool had
LINE 257: a wiggle in its uneven legs, that she declared was very soothing; and no
LINE 258: page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on
LINE 259: which appeared, in tipsy capitals, the words,--"To dear Grandma, from
LINE 260: her little Beth."
LINE 261: During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and, when
LINE 262: Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy
LINE 263: wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.
LINE 264: Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree
LINE 265: to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sung, with all
LINE 266: their hearts, the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and
LINE 267: the Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was
LINE 268: something altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March
LINE 269: couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every
LINE 270: one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little
LINE 271: quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.
LINE 272: After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and
LINE 273: her daughters under the festival tree.
LINE 274: [Illustration: "Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival
LINE 275: tree."--Page 583]
LINE 276: "I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'Unlucky Jo' again, when my
LINE 277: greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified," said Mrs. Bhaer,
LINE 278: taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk-pitcher, in which he was
LINE 279: rapturously churning.
LINE 280: "And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long
LINE 281: ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?" asked Amy, smiling as she
LINE 282: watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.
LINE 283: "Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business, and
LINE 284: frolic for a day," answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all
LINE 285: mankind. "Yes, I remember; but the life I wanted then seems selfish,
LINE 286: lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope that I may write
LINE 287: a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the better
LINE 288: for such experiences and illustrations as these;" and Jo pointed from
LINE 289: the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the
LINE 290: Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one
LINE 291: of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother,
LINE 292: sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap
LINE 293: and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which
LINE 294: never could grow old to them.
LINE 295: "My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid
LINE 296: things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I
LINE 297: had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I've got
LINE 298: them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world;" and Meg
LINE 299: laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender and
LINE 300: devout content.
LINE 301: "My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter
LINE 302: it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or
LINE 303: confine myself to helping others fulfil their dreams of beauty. I've
LINE 304: begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing
LINE 305: I've ever done. I think so myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that,
LINE 306: whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel."
LINE 307: As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping
LINE 308: child in her arms; for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little
LINE 309: creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's sunshine.
LINE 310: This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and
LINE 311: sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was growing sweeter,
LINE 312: deeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and
LINE 313: firm; and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love
LINE 314: itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blest;
LINE 315: for--
LINE 316: "Into each life some rain must fall,
LINE 317: Some days must be dark and sad and dreary."
LINE 318: "She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, but
LINE 319: hope and keep happy," said Mrs. March, as tender-hearted Daisy stooped
LINE 320: from her knee, to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale
LINE 321: one.
LINE 322: "I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie
LINE 323: to take more than half of every burden," replied Amy warmly. "He never
LINE 324: lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so devoted
LINE 325: to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always, that I can't love him
LINE 326: enough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, 'Thank God,
LINE 327: I'm a happy woman.'"
LINE 328: "There's no need for me to say it, for every one can see that I'm far
LINE 329: happier than I deserve," added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her
LINE 330: chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. "Fritz is getting
LINE 331: gray and stout; I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we never
LINE 332: shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that
LINE 333: incorrigible Tommy Bangs _will_ smoke sweet-fern cigars under the
LINE 334: bed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already. But in
LINE 335: spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and
LINE 336: never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys,
LINE 337: I can't help using their expressions now and then."
LINE 338: "Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one," began Mrs. March,
LINE 339: frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of
LINE 340: countenance.
LINE 341: "Not half so good as yours, mother. Here it is, and we never can thank
LINE 342: you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done," cried Jo,
LINE 343: with the loving impetuosity which she never could outgrow.
LINE 344: "I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year," said Amy
LINE 345: softly.
LINE 346: "A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee
LINE 347: dear," added Meg's tender voice.
LINE 348: Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if
LINE 349: to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and
LINE 350: voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility,--
LINE 351: "O, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater
LINE 352: happiness than this!"
