LINE 1: It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and
LINE 2: genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this
LINE 3: distinction through much tribulation; for, mistaking enthusiasm for
LINE 4: inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.
LINE 5: For a long time there was a lull in the "mud-pie" business, and she
LINE 6: devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed
LINE 7: such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant
LINE 8: and profitable. But overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid
LINE 9: aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,
LINE 10: the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration; for the odor of
LINE 11: burning wood pervaded the house at all hours; smoke issued from attic
LINE 12: and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about
LINE 13: promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and
LINE 14: the dinner-bell at her door, in case of fire. Raphael's face was found
LINE 15: boldly executed on the under side of the moulding-board, and Bacchus on
LINE 16: the head of a beer-barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the
LINE 17: sugar-bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied
LINE 18: kindlings for some time.
LINE 19: From fire to oil was a natural transition for burnt fingers, and Amy
LINE 20: fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her
LINE 21: out with his cast-off palettes, brushes, and colors; and she daubed
LINE 22: away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on
LINE 23: land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken
LINE 24: prizes at an agricultural fair; and the perilous pitching of her vessels
LINE 25: would have produced sea-sickness in the most nautical observer, if the
LINE 26: utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not
LINE 27: convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and
LINE 28: dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,
LINE 29: suggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces, with a lurid streak in
LINE 30: the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants,
LINE 31: Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange
LINE 32: lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash
LINE 33: in the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor's shirt or a
LINE 34: king's robe, as the spectator pleased.
LINE 35: Charcoal portraits came next; and the entire family hung in a row,
LINE 36: looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coal-bin. Softened
LINE 37: into crayon sketches, they did better; for the likenesses were good, and
LINE 38: Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced
LINE 39: "wonderfully fine." A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly
LINE 40: casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off
LINE 41: closet-shelves on to people's heads. Children were enticed in as models,
LINE 42: till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy
LINE 43: to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line,
LINE 44: however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which
LINE 45: quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook
LINE 46: to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an
LINE 47: unearthly bumping and screaming, and running to the rescue, found the
LINE 48: young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed, with her foot held fast
LINE 49: in a pan-full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity.
LINE 50: With much difficulty and some danger she was dug out; for Jo was so
LINE 51: overcome with laughter while she excavated, that her knife went too far,
LINE 52: cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt,
LINE 53: at least.
LINE 54: [Illustration: Her foot held fast in a panful of plaster]
LINE 55: After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her
LINE 56: to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing
LINE 57: for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to
LINE 58: book "a delicious bit," composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and
LINE 59: a broken mullein-stalk, or "a heavenly mass of clouds," that looked like
LINE 60: a choice display of feather-beds when done. She sacrificed her
LINE 61: complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun, to study light
LINE 62: and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose, trying after "points of
LINE 63: sight," or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.
LINE 64: If "genius is eternal patience," as Michael Angelo affirms, Amy
LINE 65: certainly had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in
LINE 66: spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing
LINE 67: that in time she should do something worthy to be called "high art."
LINE 68: She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she
LINE 69: had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she
LINE 70: never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better; for she was one
LINE 71: of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends
LINE 72: everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate
LINE 73: souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star.
LINE 74: Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an
LINE 75: instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right
LINE 76: thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and
LINE 77: was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to
LINE 78: court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do."
LINE 79: One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in "our best society,"
LINE 80: without being quite sure what the _best_ really was. Money, position,
LINE 81: fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable
LINE 82: things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed
LINE 83: them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not
LINE 84: admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she
LINE 85: cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the
LINE 86: opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty
LINE 87: now excluded her.
LINE 88: "My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine
LINE 89: lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy
LINE 90: refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and
LINE 91: that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.
LINE 92: "I want to ask a favor of you, mamma," Amy said, coming in, with an
LINE 93: important air, one day.
LINE 94: "Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose eyes the
LINE 95: stately young lady still remained "the baby."
LINE 96: "Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate
LINE 97: for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to
LINE 98: see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things
LINE 99: they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and
LINE 100: I am grateful, for they are all rich, and know I am poor, yet they never
LINE 101: made any difference."
LINE 102: "Why should they?" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls
LINE 103: called her "Maria Theresa air."
LINE 104: "You know as well as I that it _does_ make a difference with nearly
LINE 105: every one, so don't ruffle up, like a dear, motherly hen, when your
LINE 106: chickens get pecked by smarter birds; the ugly duckling turned out a
LINE 107: swan, you know;" and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a
LINE 108: happy temper and hopeful spirit.
LINE 109: Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,--
LINE 110: "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"
LINE 111: "I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them a
LINE 112: drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and
LINE 113: make a little artistic _fête_ for them."
LINE 114: "That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches,
LINE 115: fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"
LINE 116: "Oh dear, no! we must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and
LINE 117: ice-cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my
LINE 118: lunch to be proper and elegant, though I _do_ work for my living."
LINE 119: "How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning to look
LINE 120: sober.
LINE 121: "Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."
LINE 122: "Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them
LINE 123: about."
LINE 124: "Why, mother, how _can_ you think of such a thing? Not more than six or
LINE 125: eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach-wagon, and borrow Mr.
LINE 126: Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of _char-à-banc_.)
LINE 127: "All this will be expensive, Amy."
LINE 128: "Not very; I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."
LINE 129: "Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and
LINE 130: the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be
LINE 131: pleasanter to them, as a change, if nothing more, and much better for us
LINE 132: than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and attempting a style not
LINE 133: in keeping with our circumstances?"
LINE 134: "If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know
LINE 135: that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help
LINE 136: a little; and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,"
LINE 137: said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
LINE 138: obstinacy.
LINE 139: Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it
LINE 140: was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she
LINE 141: would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice
LINE 142: as much as they did salts and senna.
LINE 143: "Very well, Amy; if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way
LINE 144: through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say
LINE 145: no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll
LINE 146: do my best to help you."
LINE 147: "Thanks, mother; you are always _so_ kind;" and away went Amy to lay her
LINE 148: plan before her sisters.
LINE 149: Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she
LINE 150: possessed, from her little house itself to her very best salt-spoons.
LINE 151: But Jo frowned upon the whole project, and would have nothing to do with
LINE 152: it at first.
LINE 153: "Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and
LINE 154: turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a
LINE 155: sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle
LINE 156: to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a
LINE 157: _coupé_," said Jo, who, being called from the tragical climax of her
LINE 158: novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.
LINE 159: "I _don't_ truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!"
LINE 160: returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions
LINE 161: arose. "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great
LINE 162: deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you
LINE 163: call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go
LINE 164: into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I
LINE 165: mean to make the most of every chance that comes. _You_ can go through
LINE 166: the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it
LINE 167: independence, if you like. That's not my way."
LINE 168: When Amy whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best
LINE 169: of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo
LINE 170: carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an
LINE 171: unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an
LINE 172: argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good
LINE 173: hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable
LINE 174: turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day
LINE 175: to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as "a
LINE 176: nonsensical business."
LINE 177: The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday
LINE 178: was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her
LINE 179: week's work was deranged, and prophesied that "ef the washin' and
LINE 180: ironin' warn't done reg'lar nothin' would go well anywheres." This hitch
LINE 181: in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the
LINE 182: whole concern; but Amy's motto was "Nil desperandum," and having made up
LINE 183: her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles.
LINE 184: To begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well: the chicken was
LINE 185: tough, the tongue too salt, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.
LINE 186: Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon; and
LINE 187: various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up
LINE 188: rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold and took to her bed, Meg had
LINE 189: an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a
LINE 190: divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were
LINE 191: uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.
LINE 192: "If it hadn't been for mother I never should have got through," as Amy
LINE 193: declared afterward, and gratefully remembered when "the best joke of the
LINE 194: season" was entirely forgotten by everybody else.
LINE 195: If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on
LINE 196: Tuesday,--an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last
LINE 197: degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which
LINE 198: is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a
LINE 199: little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late
LINE 200: for any one else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people
LINE 201: out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be
LINE 202: got in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby; but
LINE 203: without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skilfully made the
LINE 204: best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the
LINE 205: carpet, covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy, and
LINE 206: filling up empty corners with home-made statuary, which gave an artistic
LINE 207: air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.
LINE 208: The lunch looked charmingly; and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped
LINE 209: it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver
LINE 210: would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and mother
LINE 211: were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the
LINE 212: scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, an
LINE 213: aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything
LINE 214: would allow, and, as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with
LINE 215: anticipations of the happy moment, when, lunch safely over, she should
LINE 216: drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights; for
LINE 217: the "cherry-bounce" and the broken bridge were her strong points.
LINE 218: Then came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor
LINE 219: to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart
LINE 220: shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young
LINE 221: ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the
LINE 222: exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the
LINE 223: perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.
LINE 224: "No doubt about the weather to-day; they will certainly come, so we must
LINE 225: fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke her next
LINE 226: morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had
LINE 227: said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting
LINE 228: a little stale.
LINE 229: "I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad to-day,"
LINE 230: said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of
LINE 231: placid despair.
LINE 232: "Use the chicken, then; the toughness won't matter in a salad," advised
LINE 233: his wife.
LINE 234: "Hannah left it on the kitchen-table a minute, and the kittens got at
LINE 235: it. I'm very sorry, Amy," added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.
LINE 236: "Then I _must_ have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said Amy
LINE 237: decidedly.
LINE 238: "Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the magnanimity
LINE 239: of a martyr.
LINE 240: "You'd come bringing it home under your arm, without any paper, just to
LINE 241: try me. I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to
LINE 242: fail.
LINE 243: Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travelling-basket, she
LINE 244: departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit, and
LINE 245: fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her
LINE 246: desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing, to prevent further
LINE 247: loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own
LINE 248: forethought.
LINE 249: As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,
LINE 250: Amy pocketed her veil, and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to
LINE 251: find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card
LINE 252: full of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer, who
LINE 253: entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,
LINE 254: "Good-morning, Miss March," and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's
LINE 255: most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out
LINE 256: before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and,
LINE 257: congratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress,
LINE 258: returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.
LINE 259: They got on excellently; for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by
LINE 260: learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away
LINE 261: in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to
LINE 262: the door, she upset the basket, and--oh, horror!--the lobster, in all
LINE 263: its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a
LINE 264: Tudor.
LINE 265: "By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious youth,
LINE 266: poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing
LINE 267: to hand out the basket after the old lady.
LINE 268: "Please don't--it's--it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red
LINE 269: as her fish.
LINE 270: [Illustration: Please don't, it's mine]
LINE 271: "Oh, really, I beg pardon; it's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?" said
LINE 272: Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that
LINE 273: did credit to his breeding.
LINE 274: Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,
LINE 275: and said, laughing,--
LINE 276: "Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad he's to make, and to
LINE 277: see the charming young ladies who are to eat it?"
LINE 278: Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind
LINE 279: were touched: the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing
LINE 280: reminiscences, and curiosity about "the charming young ladies" diverted
LINE 281: his mind from the comical mishap.
LINE 282: "I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I sha'n't see
LINE 283: them; that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.
LINE 284: She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,
LINE 285: thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of
LINE 286: dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the
LINE 287: preparations which now seemed more irksome than before; and at twelve
LINE 288: o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested
LINE 289: in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's
LINE 290: failure by a grand success to-day; so she ordered the "cherry-bounce,"
LINE 291: and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.
LINE 292: "There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go into the porch to meet
LINE 293: them; it looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time
LINE 294: after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word.
LINE 295: But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression,
LINE 296: for, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.
LINE 297: "Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will
LINE 298: be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl," cried
LINE 299: Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a
LINE 300: laugh.
LINE 301: In came Amy, quite calm, and delightfully cordial to the one guest who
LINE 302: had kept her promise; the rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn,
LINE 303: played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most
LINE 304: hilarious set; for it was impossible to entirely control the merriment
LINE 305: which possessed them. The remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of, the
LINE 306: studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy
LINE 307: ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her
LINE 308: friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when "the party went
LINE 309: out."
LINE 310: As she came walking in, looking very tired, but as composed as ever, she
LINE 311: observed that every vestige of the unfortunate _fête_ had disappeared,
LINE 312: except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.
LINE 313: "You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear," said her mother,
LINE 314: as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.
LINE 315: "Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I
LINE 316: thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.
LINE 317: "Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so
LINE 318: much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours," asked Meg
LINE 319: soberly.
LINE 320: "Take it all; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will
LINE 321: mould before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of
LINE 322: the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.
LINE 323: "It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they sat down
LINE 324: to ice-cream and salad for the second time in two days.
LINE 325: A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the
LINE 326: whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,
LINE 327: "Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn"--here
LINE 328: a general explosion of laughter cut short the "history of sallets," to
LINE 329: the great surprise of the learned gentleman.
LINE 330: "Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels: Germans
LINE 331: like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this; and there's no reason you
LINE 332: should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried Amy, wiping
LINE 333: her eyes.
LINE 334: "I thought I _should_ have died when I saw you two girls rattling about
LINE 335: in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell,
LINE 336: and mother waiting in state to receive the throng," sighed Jo, quite
LINE 337: spent with laughter.
LINE 338: "I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to
LINE 339: satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.
LINE 340: "I _am_ satisfied; I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault
LINE 341: that it failed; I comfort myself with that," said Amy, with a little
LINE 342: quiver in her voice. "I thank you all very much for helping me, and I'll
LINE 343: thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least."
LINE 344: No one did for several months; but the word "_fête_" always produced a
LINE 345: general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral
LINE 346: lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch-guard.
