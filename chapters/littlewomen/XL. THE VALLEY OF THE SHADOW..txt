LINE 1: When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,
LINE 2: and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased
LINE 3: affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of
LINE 4: trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward
LINE 5: making that last year a happy one.
LINE 6: The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was
LINE 7: gathered everything that she most loved,--flowers, pictures, her piano,
LINE 8: the little work-table, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books
LINE 9: found their way there, mother's easy-chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest
LINE 10: sketches; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,
LINE 11: to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,
LINE 12: that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with
LINE 13: the fruit she loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of
LINE 14: concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears
LINE 15: as she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful
LINE 16: letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands
LINE 17: that know no winter.
LINE 18: Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil
LINE 19: and busy as ever; for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature,
LINE 20: and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for
LINE 21: those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and
LINE 22: one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school-children
LINE 23: daily passing to and fro,--to drop a pair of mittens from her window for
LINE 24: a pair of purple hands, a needle-book for some small mother of many
LINE 25: dolls, pen-wipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pot-hooks,
LINE 26: scrap-books for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices,
LINE 27: till the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way
LINE 28: strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as
LINE 29: a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts
LINE 30: miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any
LINE 31: reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her
LINE 32: window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to
LINE 33: her, full of blots and gratitude.
LINE 34: The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look
LINE 35: round, and say "How beautiful this is!" as they all sat together in her
LINE 36: sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and
LINE 37: sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from
LINE 38: the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as
LINE 39: applicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a
LINE 40: paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying
LINE 41: to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation
LINE 42: possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who
LINE 43: listened; for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the
LINE 44: frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he
LINE 45: spoke or read.
LINE 46: It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as
LINE 47: preparation for the sad hours to come; for, by and by, Beth said the
LINE 48: needle was "so heavy," and put it down forever; talking wearied her,
LINE 49: faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil
LINE 50: spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble
LINE 51: flesh. Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching
LINE 52: hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced
LINE 53: to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the
LINE 54: bitter cry, "Help me, help me!" and to feel that there was no help. A
LINE 55: sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with
LINE 56: death; but both were mercifully brief, and then, the natural rebellion
LINE 57: over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of
LINE 58: her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong; and, though she said little,
LINE 59: those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim
LINE 60: called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,
LINE 61: trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed
LINE 62: the river.
LINE 63: Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, "I feel stronger when
LINE 64: you are here." She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew
LINE 65: the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom
LINE 66: asked for anything, and "tried not to be a trouble." All day she haunted
LINE 67: the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then
LINE 68: than of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours
LINE 69: to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed; lessons
LINE 70: in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn
LINE 71: them; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly
LINE 72: forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and
LINE 73: the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.
LINE 74: Often, when she woke, Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little
LINE 75: book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw
LINE 76: her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the
LINE 77: transparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her, with thoughts too
LINE 78: deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was
LINE 79: trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the
LINE 80: life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music
LINE 81: she loved so well.
LINE 82: Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest
LINE 83: hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with
LINE 84: eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest
LINE 85: sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life,--uneventful,
LINE 86: unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which "smell sweet, and
LINE 87: blossom in the dust," the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on
LINE 88: earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible
LINE 89: to all.
LINE 90: One night, when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find
LINE 91: something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as
LINE 92: hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite
LINE 93: Pilgrim's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's
LINE 94: hand. The name caught her eye, and the blurred look of the lines made
LINE 95: her sure that tears had fallen on it.
LINE 96: "Poor Jo! she's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave; she shows
LINE 97: me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this,"
LINE 98: thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the
LINE 99: tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.
LINE 100: "MY BETH.
LINE 101: "Sitting patient in the shadow
LINE 102: Till the blessed light shall come,
LINE 103: A serene and saintly presence
LINE 104: Sanctifies our troubled home.
LINE 105: Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows
LINE 106: Break like ripples on the strand
LINE 107: Of the deep and solemn river
LINE 108: Where her willing feet now stand.
LINE 109: "O my sister, passing from me,
LINE 110: Out of human care and strife,
LINE 111: Leave me, as a gift, those virtues
LINE 112: Which have beautified your life.
LINE 113: Dear, bequeath me that great patience
LINE 114: Which has power to sustain
LINE 115: A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit
LINE 116: In its prison-house of pain.
LINE 117: "Give me, for I need it sorely,
LINE 118: Of that courage, wise and sweet,
LINE 119: Which has made the path of duty
LINE 120: Green beneath your willing feet.
LINE 121: Give me that unselfish nature,
LINE 122: That with charity divine
LINE 123: Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--
LINE 124: Meek heart, forgive me mine!
LINE 125: "Thus our parting daily loseth
LINE 126: Something of its bitter pain,
LINE 127: And while learning this hard lesson,
LINE 128: My great loss becomes my gain.
LINE 129: For the touch of grief will render
LINE 130: My wild nature more serene,
LINE 131: Give to life new aspirations,
LINE 132: A new trust in the unseen.
LINE 133: "Henceforth, safe across the river,
LINE 134: I shall see forevermore
LINE 135: A beloved, household spirit
LINE 136: Waiting for me on the shore.
LINE 137: Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,
LINE 138: Guardian angels shall become,
LINE 139: And the sister gone before me
LINE 140: By their hands shall lead me home."
LINE 141: Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble, as the lines were, they brought
LINE 142: a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had
LINE 143: been that she had done so little; and this seemed to assure her that her
LINE 144: life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the despair
LINE 145: she feared. As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the
LINE 146: charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to
LINE 147: the bedside, hoping Beth slept.
LINE 148: "Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it; I knew
LINE 149: you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?" she asked, with
LINE 150: wistful, humble earnestness.
LINE 151: "O Beth, so much, so much!" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow,
LINE 152: beside her sister's.
LINE 153: "Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make
LINE 154: me, but I _have_ tried to do right; and now, when it's too late to
LINE 155: begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that some one loves
LINE 156: me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."
LINE 157: "More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let
LINE 158: you go; but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you; that you'll be
LINE 159: more to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to."
LINE 160: "I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall
LINE 161: be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take
LINE 162: my place, Jo, and be everything to father and mother when I'm gone. They
LINE 163: will turn to you, don't fail them; and if it's hard to work alone,
LINE 164: remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing
LINE 165: that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world; for love is
LINE 166: the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the
LINE 167: end so easy."
LINE 168: "I'll try, Beth;" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,
LINE 169: pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of
LINE 170: other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the
LINE 171: immortality of love.
LINE 172: So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth
LINE 173: greener, the flowers were up fair and early, and the birds came back in
LINE 174: time to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung
LINE 175: to the hands that had led her all her life, as father and mother guided
LINE 176: her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.
LINE 177: Seldom, except in books, do the dying utter memorable words, see
LINE 178: visions, or depart with beatified countenances; and those who have sped
LINE 179: many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and
LINE 180: simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the "tide went out easily;" and in
LINE 181: the dark hour before the dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her
LINE 182: first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving
LINE 183: look, one little sigh.
LINE 184: With tears and prayers and tender hands, mother and sisters made her
LINE 185: ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with
LINE 186: grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic
LINE 187: patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling, with reverent
LINE 188: joy, that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom
LINE 189: full of dread.
LINE 190: When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,
LINE 191: Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang
LINE 192: blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snow-drops blossomed freshly
LINE 193: at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction
LINE 194: over the placid face upon the pillow,--a face so full of painless peace
LINE 195: that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God
LINE 196: that Beth was well at last.
