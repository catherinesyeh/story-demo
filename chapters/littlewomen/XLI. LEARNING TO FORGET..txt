LINE 1: Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till
LINE 2: long afterward; men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, the
LINE 3: lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded
LINE 4: themselves that it is just what they intended to do; then they act upon
LINE 5: it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the credit of
LINE 6: it; if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back to
LINE 7: his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the
LINE 8: old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully,
LINE 9: and he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman
LINE 10: would have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back
LINE 11: after the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the
LINE 12: longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the
LINE 13: words that had made the deepest impression, "I despise you;" "Go and do
LINE 14: something splendid that will _make_ her love you."
LINE 15: Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought
LINE 16: himself to confess that he _had_ been selfish and lazy; but then when a
LINE 17: man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries
LINE 18: till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were
LINE 19: quite dead now; and, though he should never cease to be a faithful
LINE 20: mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo
LINE 21: _wouldn't_ love him, but he might _make_ her respect and admire him by
LINE 22: doing something which should prove that a girl's "No" had not spoilt his
LINE 23: life. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite
LINE 24: unnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted
LINE 25: affections were decently interred; that being done, he felt that he was
LINE 26: ready to "hide his stricken heart, and still toil on."
LINE 27: As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie
LINE 28: resolved to embalm his love-sorrow in music, and compose a Requiem which
LINE 29: should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore
LINE 30: the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody,
LINE 31: and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends,
LINE 32: and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.
LINE 33: But, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music
LINE 34: too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem
LINE 35: was beyond him, just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in
LINE 36: working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying; for often in the
LINE 37: middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing
LINE 38: tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the
LINE 39: stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the
LINE 40: time being.
LINE 41: Then he tried an Opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning;
LINE 42: but here, again, unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his
LINE 43: heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender
LINE 44: recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned
LINE 45: traitor; and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would
LINE 46: only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in
LINE 47: the most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in
LINE 48: a bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold
LINE 49: water over his passion _Ã  la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh
LINE 50: spoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be
LINE 51: put into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a "Bless
LINE 52: that girl, what a torment she is!" and a clutch at his hair, as became a
LINE 53: distracted composer.
LINE 54: When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to
LINE 55: immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging
LINE 56: readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,
LINE 57: was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his
LINE 58: mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and
LINE 59: blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he
LINE 60: took her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;
LINE 61: for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted
LINE 62: her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal
LINE 63: woman.
LINE 64: Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but
LINE 65: gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he
LINE 66: sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas
LINE 67: and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state
LINE 68: that winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was
LINE 69: conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. "It's
LINE 70: genius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of
LINE 71: it," he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn't
LINE 72: genius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to
LINE 73: some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory
LINE 74: life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and
LINE 75: body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved
LINE 76: music was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,
LINE 77: splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,
LINE 78: played a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of
LINE 79: Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then
LINE 80: suddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last
LINE 81: fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--
LINE 82: "She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That
LINE 83: music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I
LINE 84: won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?"
LINE 85: That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had
LINE 86: to work for his daily bread. Now, if ever, occurred an eligible
LINE 87: opportunity for "going to the devil," as he once forcibly expressed it,
LINE 88: for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially
LINE 89: fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow
LINE 90: had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood
LINE 91: them pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith
LINE 92: and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire
LINE 93: to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,
LINE 94: and say "All's well," kept him safe and steady.
LINE 95: Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, "I don't believe it; boys
LINE 96: will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not
LINE 97: expect miracles." I dare say _you_ don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true
LINE 98: nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion
LINE 99: that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by
LINE 100: refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the
LINE 101: better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but
LINE 102: mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and
LINE 103: keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing
LINE 104: that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which
LINE 105: make men manliest in good women's eyes. If it _is_ a feminine delusion,
LINE 106: leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and
LINE 107: the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter
LINE 108: all our hopes of the brave, tender-hearted little lads, who still love
LINE 109: their mothers better than themselves, and are not ashamed to own it.
LINE 110: Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb
LINE 111: all his powers for years; but, to his great surprise, he discovered it
LINE 112: grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with
LINE 113: himself, and couldn't understand it; but these hearts of ours are
LINE 114: curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in
LINE 115: spite of us. Laurie's heart _wouldn't_ ache; the wound persisted in
LINE 116: healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and, instead of trying to
LINE 117: forget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this
LINE 118: turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with
LINE 119: himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of
LINE 120: disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous
LINE 121: blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but
LINE 122: they refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow
LINE 123: that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he
LINE 124: was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly
LINE 125: subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and
LINE 126: resentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a
LINE 127: brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.
LINE 128: As the word "brotherly" passed through his mind in one of these
LINE 129: reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was
LINE 130: before him:--
LINE 131: "Well, he was a great man; and when he couldn't have one sister he took
LINE 132: the other, and was happy."
LINE 133: Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next
LINE 134: instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--
LINE 135: "No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if
LINE 136: that fails, why, then--"
LINE 137: Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to
LINE 138: Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the
LINE 139: least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let
LINE 140: him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing,
LINE 141: but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It
LINE 142: came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo
LINE 143: decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never
LINE 144: wished to hear the word "love" again. Then she begged him to be happy
LINE 145: with somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for
LINE 146: his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy
LINE 147: that Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no
LINE 148: need of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,
LINE 149: please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel
LINE 150: lonely, homesick, or anxious.
LINE 151: "So I will, at once. Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for
LINE 152: her, I'm afraid;" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had
LINE 153: been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks
LINE 154: before.
LINE 155: But he did not write the letter that day; for, as he rummaged out his
LINE 156: best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. Tumbling
LINE 157: about in one part of the desk, among bills, passports, and business
LINE 158: documents of various kinds, were several of Jo's letters, and in another
LINE 159: compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her
LINE 160: blue ribbons, and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away
LINE 161: inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered
LINE 162: up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small
LINE 163: drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his
LINE 164: finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the
LINE 165: drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if
LINE 166: there had been a funeral; and, though not overwhelmed with affliction,
LINE 167: this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in
LINE 168: writing letters to charming young ladies.
LINE 169: [Illustration: Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger]
LINE 170: The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy
LINE 171: _was_ homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding
LINE 172: manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and
LINE 173: fro, with unfailing regularity, all through the early spring. Laurie
LINE 174: sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,
LINE 175: hoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to
LINE 176: Nice, but would not till he was asked; and Amy would not ask him, for
LINE 177: just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her
LINE 178: rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of "our boy."
LINE 179: Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once
LINE 180: decided to answer "Yes, thank you;" but now she said, "No, thank you,"
LINE 181: kindly but steadily; for, when the time came, her courage failed her,
LINE 182: and she found that something more than money and position was needed to
LINE 183: satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes
LINE 184: and fears. The words, "Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I
LINE 185: fancied you would ever like," and Laurie's face when he uttered them,
LINE 186: kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in
LINE 187: look, if not in words, "I shall marry for money." It troubled her to
LINE 188: remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so
LINE 189: unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly
LINE 190: creature; she didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as
LINE 191: she did to be a lovable woman; she was so glad he didn't hate her for
LINE 192: the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully, and was
LINE 193: kinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters
LINE 194: were very irregular, and were not half so satisfactory as his when they
LINE 195: did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the
LINE 196: poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being
LINE 197: stony-hearted. She ought to have made an effort, and tried to love him;
LINE 198: it couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have
LINE 199: such a dear boy care for them; but Jo never would act like other girls,
LINE 200: so there was nothing to do but be very kind, and treat him like a
LINE 201: brother.
LINE 202: If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they
LINE 203: would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured
LINE 204: now; she asked his opinion on all subjects; she was interested in
LINE 205: everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him
LINE 206: two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and
LINE 207: captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are
LINE 208: complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters'
LINE 209: pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when
LINE 210: long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of
LINE 211: these fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale
LINE 212: and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went
LINE 213: out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she
LINE 214: came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours,
LINE 215: with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched
LINE 216: any fancy that occurred to her,--a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a
LINE 217: young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a
LINE 218: curly-haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ball-room on the
LINE 219: arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the
LINE 220: last fashion in art, which was safe, but not altogether satisfactory.
LINE 221: Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred; and, finding
LINE 222: denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what
LINE 223: she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to
LINE 224: Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he
LINE 225: said to himself, with a venerable air,--
LINE 226: "I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been
LINE 227: through it all, and I can sympathize."
LINE 228: With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his
LINE 229: duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa, and enjoyed Amy's letter
LINE 230: luxuriously.
LINE 231: While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home; but
LINE 232: the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the
LINE 233: next found her, the grass was green above her sister. The sad news met
LINE 234: her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they
LINE 235: had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian
LINE 236: lakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree
LINE 237: that she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say
LINE 238: good-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.
LINE 239: But her heart was very heavy; she longed to be at home, and every day
LINE 240: looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort
LINE 241: her.
LINE 242: He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both,
LINE 243: but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he
LINE 244: read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow-pedestrians,
LINE 245: and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow,
LINE 246: hope and suspense.
LINE 247: He knew Vevay well; and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he
LINE 248: hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living _en
LINE 249: pension_. The _garÃ§on_ was in despair that the whole family had gone to
LINE 250: take a promenade on the lake; but no, the blond mademoiselle might be in
LINE 251: the chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting
LINE 252: down, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait
LINE 253: even "a flash of time," and, in the middle of the speech, departed to
LINE 254: find mademoiselle himself.
LINE 255: A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts
LINE 256: rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the
LINE 257: tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low
LINE 258: wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console
LINE 259: herself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day,
LINE 260: leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,
LINE 261: thinking of Beth, and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not
LINE 262: hear him cross the court-yard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway
LINE 263: that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute,
LINE 264: looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen
LINE 265: before,--the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely
LINE 266: suggested love and sorrow,--the blotted letters in her lap, the black
LINE 267: ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face;
LINE 268: even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for
LINE 269: he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had
LINE 270: any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at
LINE 271: rest the minute she looked up and saw him; for, dropping everything, she
LINE 272: ran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing,--
LINE 273: "O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"
LINE 274: [Illustration: O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come]
LINE 275: I think everything was said and settled then; for, as they stood
LINE 276: together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down
LINE 277: protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and
LINE 278: sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only
LINE 279: woman in the world who could fill Jo's place, and make him happy. He did
LINE 280: not tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,
LINE 281: were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.
LINE 282: In a minute Amy went back to her place; and, while she dried her tears,
LINE 283: Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry
LINE 284: well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As
LINE 285: he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the
LINE 286: recollection of her impulsive greeting.
LINE 287: "I couldn't help it; I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to
LINE 288: see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was
LINE 289: beginning to fear you wouldn't come," she said, trying in vain to speak
LINE 290: quite naturally.
LINE 291: "I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you
LINE 292: for the loss of dear little Beth; but I can only feel, and--" He could
LINE 293: not get any further, for he, too, turned bashful all of a sudden, and
LINE 294: did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy's head down on his
LINE 295: shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare; so took
LINE 296: her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than
LINE 297: words.
LINE 298: "You needn't say anything; this comforts me," she said softly. "Beth is
LINE 299: well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back; but I dread the going home,
LINE 300: much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for it makes
LINE 301: me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't go right
LINE 302: back, need you?"
LINE 303: "Not if you want me, dear."
LINE 304: "I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind; but you seem like one of the
LINE 305: family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while."
LINE 306: Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child, whose heart was full,
LINE 307: that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what
LINE 308: she wanted,--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation
LINE 309: she needed.
LINE 310: "Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half-sick! I'm
LINE 311: going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk
LINE 312: about with me; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still," he said, in
LINE 313: the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on
LINE 314: her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the
LINE 315: sunny walk, under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon
LINE 316: his legs; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean
LINE 317: upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk
LINE 318: delightfully for her alone.
LINE 319: The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed
LINE 320: expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but
LINE 321: the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of
LINE 322: their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked
LINE 323: and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which
LINE 324: gave such a charm to time and place; and when an unromantic dinner-bell
LINE 325: warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and
LINE 326: sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.
LINE 327: The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated
LINE 328: with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, "Now I understand it
LINE 329: all,--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I
LINE 330: never thought of such a thing!"
LINE 331: With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed
LINE 332: no sign of enlightenment; but cordially urged Laurie to stay, and begged
LINE 333: Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much
LINE 334: solitude. Amy was a model of docility; and, as her aunt was a good deal
LINE 335: occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with
LINE 336: more than her usual success.
LINE 337: At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded; at Vevay, Laurie was
LINE 338: never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying, in the
LINE 339: most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did, and followed
LINE 340: his example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was
LINE 341: owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a
LINE 342: like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.
LINE 343: The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked
LINE 344: wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer
LINE 345: views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh
LINE 346: winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists;
LINE 347: the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender
LINE 348: hopes, and happy thoughts; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of
LINE 349: the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them,
LINE 350: saying, "Little children, love one another."
LINE 351: In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that
LINE 352: Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little
LINE 353: while to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and,
LINE 354: as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself
LINE 355: for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost
LINE 356: the same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been
LINE 357: impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His
LINE 358: first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon
LINE 359: it as if through a long vista of years, with a feeling of compassion
LINE 360: blended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of
LINE 361: the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful
LINE 362: when the pain was over. His second wooing he resolved should be as calm
LINE 363: and simple as possible; there was no need of having a scene, hardly any
LINE 364: need of telling Amy that he loved her; she knew it without words, and
LINE 365: had given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that
LINE 366: no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even
LINE 367: Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be
LINE 368: wary and slow in making a second trial; so Laurie let the days pass,
LINE 369: enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word
LINE 370: that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.
LINE 371: He had rather imagined that the _dÃ©nouement_ would take place in the
LINE 372: chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous
LINE 373: manner; but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was
LINE 374: settled on the lake, at noonday, in a few blunt words. They had been
LINE 375: floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny
LINE 376: Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the
LINE 377: Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon
LINE 378: the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake
LINE 379: below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged
LINE 380: gulls.
LINE 381: They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of
LINE 382: Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his "HÃ©loise."
LINE 383: Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love-story, and each
LINE 384: privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had
LINE 385: been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell
LINE 386: between them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars,
LINE 387: with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the
LINE 388: sake of saying something,--
LINE 389: "You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good;
LINE 390: for, since you came, I have been altogether lazy and luxurious."
LINE 391: "I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room
LINE 392: enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't
LINE 393: trim," returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.
LINE 394: Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third
LINE 395: of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed
LINE 396: as well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands,
LINE 397: and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly
LINE 398: through the water.
LINE 399: [Illustration: How well we pull together]
LINE 400: "How well we pull together, don't we?" said Amy, who objected to silence
LINE 401: just then.
LINE 402: "So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,
LINE 403: Amy?" very tenderly.
LINE 404: "Yes, Laurie," very low.
LINE 405: Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little
LINE 406: _tableau_ of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected
LINE 407: in the lake.
