LINE 1: The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for
LINE 2: all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.
LINE 3: Laurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something
LINE 4: funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with
LINE 5: their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The
LINE 6: other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this
LINE 7: made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,
LINE 8: after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and
LINE 9: could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's
LINE 10: motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in
LINE 11: that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and
LINE 12: interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.
LINE 13: All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new
LINE 14: friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and
LINE 15: he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were regularly
LINE 16: splendid girls." With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the
LINE 17: solitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found
LINE 18: something very charming in the innocent companionship of these
LINE 19: simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick
LINE 20: to feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively
LINE 21: ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of
LINE 22: books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged
LINE 23: to make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing
LINE 24: truant, and running over to the Marches.
LINE 25: "Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards," said
LINE 26: the old gentleman. "The good lady next door says he is studying too
LINE 27: hard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is
LINE 28: right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his
LINE 29: grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't
LINE 30: get into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is
LINE 31: doing more for him than we can."
LINE 32: What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such
LINE 33: sleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old
LINE 34: parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg
LINE 35: could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in
LINE 36: bouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the
LINE 37: old gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed
LINE 38: beauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played "lord of the manor" in
LINE 39: the most delightful style.
LINE 40: But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up
LINE 41: courage to go to the "Mansion of Bliss," as Meg called it. She went once
LINE 42: with Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared
LINE 43: at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said "Hey!" so loud,
LINE 44: that he frightened her so much her "feet chattered on the floor," she
LINE 45: told her mother; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there
LINE 46: any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements
LINE 47: could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in
LINE 48: some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the
LINE 49: brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and
LINE 50: talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had
LINE 51: heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to
LINE 52: stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if
LINE 53: fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,
LINE 54: with her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of
LINE 55: this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had
LINE 56: been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers;
LINE 57: and presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.
LINE 58: March,--
LINE 59: "The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting
LINE 60: too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of
LINE 61: your girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to
LINE 62: keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?"
LINE 63: Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep
LINE 64: from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the
LINE 65: thought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath
LINE 66: away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd
LINE 67: little nod and smile,--
LINE 68: "They needn't see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I'm
LINE 69: shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great
LINE 70: deal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine
LINE 71: o'clock."
LINE 72: Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that
LINE 73: last arrangement left nothing to be desired. "Please tell the young
LINE 74: ladies what I say; and if they don't care to come, why, never mind."
LINE 75: Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a
LINE 76: face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--
LINE 77: "O sir, they do care, very, very much!"
LINE 78: [Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]
LINE 79: "Are you the musical girl?" he asked, without any startling "Hey!" as he
LINE 80: looked down at her very kindly.
LINE 81: "I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody
LINE 82: will hear me--and be disturbed," she added, fearing to be rude, and
LINE 83: trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.
LINE 84: "Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum
LINE 85: away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you."
LINE 86: "How kind you are, sir!"
LINE 87: Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was
LINE 88: not frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because
LINE 89: she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.
LINE 90: The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,
LINE 91: stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--
LINE 92: "I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear!
LINE 93: Good day, madam;" and away he went, in a great hurry.
LINE 94: Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the
LINE 95: glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.
LINE 96: How blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,
LINE 97: because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in
LINE 98: her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of
LINE 99: the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the
LINE 100: side-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the
LINE 101: drawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some
LINE 102: pretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and
LINE 103: frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great
LINE 104: instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything
LINE 105: else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was
LINE 106: like the voice of a beloved friend.
LINE 107: She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no
LINE 108: appetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state
LINE 109: of beatitude.
LINE 110: After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every
LINE 111: day, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that
LINE 112: came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his
LINE 113: study-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie
LINE 114: mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected
LINE 115: that the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were
LINE 116: put there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about
LINE 117: music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that
LINE 118: helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what
LINE 119: isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.
LINE 120: Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a
LINE 121: greater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.
LINE 122: [Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]
LINE 123: "Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so
LINE 124: kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do
LINE 125: it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.
LINE 126: "Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking
LINE 127: him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making
LINE 128: up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's
LINE 129: requests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.
LINE 130: After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,
LINE 131: the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet
LINE 132: cheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very
LINE 133: appropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with
LINE 134: occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,
LINE 135: and they were finished before any one got tired of them. Then she wrote
LINE 136: a very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on
LINE 137: to the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.
LINE 138: When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All
LINE 139: that day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment
LINE 140: arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety
LINE 141: friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an
LINE 142: errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As
LINE 143: she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads
LINE 144: popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,
LINE 145: several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--
LINE 146: "Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!"
LINE 147: "O Beth, he's sent you--" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;
LINE 148: but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.
LINE 149: Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters
LINE 150: seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all
LINE 151: pointing, and all saying at once, "Look there! look there!" Beth did
LINE 152: look, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a
LINE 153: little cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,
LINE 154: like a sign-board, to "Miss Elizabeth March."
LINE 155: "For me?" gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should
LINE 156: tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.
LINE 157: "Yes; all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you
LINE 158: think he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the
LINE 159: letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says," cried
LINE 160: Jo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.
LINE 161: "You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!" and Beth
LINE 162: hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.
LINE 163: Jo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw
LINE 164: were,--
LINE 165: "MISS MARCH:
LINE 166: "_Dear Madam_,--"
LINE 167: "How nice it sounds! I wish some one would write to me so!" said Amy,
LINE 168: who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.
LINE 169: "'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had
LINE 170: any that suited me so well as yours,'" continued Jo.
LINE 171: "'Heart's-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always
LINE 172: remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts; so I
LINE 173: know you will allow "the old gentleman" to send you something
LINE 174: which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With
LINE 175: hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain,
LINE 176: "'Your grateful friend and humble servant,
LINE 177: "'JAMES LAURENCE.'"
LINE 178: "There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me
LINE 179: how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept
LINE 180: all her little things carefully. Just think, he's given you her piano.
LINE 181: That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music," said Jo, trying to
LINE 182: soothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever
LINE 183: been before.
LINE 184: "See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,
LINE 185: puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and
LINE 186: stool, all complete," added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying
LINE 187: its beauties.
LINE 188: "'Your humble servant, James Laurence'; only think of his writing that
LINE 189: to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid," said Amy,
LINE 190: much impressed by the note.
LINE 191: "Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby-pianny," said Hannah,
LINE 192: who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.
LINE 193: So Beth tried it; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano
LINE 194: ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie
LINE 195: order; but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the
LINE 196: happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly
LINE 197: touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright
LINE 198: pedals.
LINE 199: "You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke; for the
LINE 200: idea of the child's really going never entered her head.
LINE 201: "Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking
LINE 202: about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth
LINE 203: walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the
LINE 204: Laurences' door.
LINE 205: "Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The
LINE 206: pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her right mind,"
LINE 207: cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite
LINE 208: speechless by the miracle.
LINE 209: They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did
LINE 210: afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the
LINE 211: study-door before she gave herself time to think; and when a gruff voice
LINE 212: called out, "Come in!" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who
LINE 213: looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a
LINE 214: small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank you, sir, for--" But she
LINE 215: didn't finish; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech,
LINE 216: and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put
LINE 217: both arms round his neck, and kissed him.
LINE 218: [Illustration: She put both arms around his neck and kissed him]
LINE 219: If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman
LINE 220: wouldn't have been more astonished; but he liked it,--oh, dear, yes, he
LINE 221: liked it amazingly!--and was so touched and pleased by that confiding
LINE 222: little kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his
LINE 223: knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he
LINE 224: had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him
LINE 225: from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had
LINE 226: known him all her life; for love casts out fear, and gratitude can
LINE 227: conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate,
LINE 228: shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again,
LINE 229: looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old
LINE 230: gentleman, as he was.
LINE 231: When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of
LINE 232: expressing her satisfaction; Amy nearly fell out of the window in her
LINE 233: surprise; and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, "Well, I do believe
LINE 234: the world is coming to an end!"
