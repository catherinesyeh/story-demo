LINE 1: Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good-luck penny in her
LINE 2: path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would
LINE 3: have given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her
LINE 4: in this wise.
LINE 5: Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her
LINE 6: scribbling suit, and "fall into a vortex," as she expressed it, writing
LINE 7: away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was
LINE 8: finished she could find no peace. Her "scribbling suit" consisted of a
LINE 9: black woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a
LINE 10: cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which
LINE 11: she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap
LINE 12: was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these
LINE 13: periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads
LINE 14: semi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, "Does genius burn, Jo?" They
LINE 15: did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an
LINE 16: observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive
LINE 17: article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that
LINE 18: hard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly
LINE 19: askew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and
LINE 20: cast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew; and
LINE 21: not until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow, did any
LINE 22: one dare address Jo.
LINE 23: She did not think herself a genius by any means; but when the writing
LINE 24: fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a
LINE 25: blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat
LINE 26: safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and
LINE 27: dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood
LINE 28: untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which
LINE 29: blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even
LINE 30: if they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week
LINE 31: or two, and then she emerged from her "vortex," hungry, sleepy, cross,
LINE 32: or despondent.
LINE 33: She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed
LINE 34: upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue
LINE 35: was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on
LINE 36: the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for
LINE 37: such an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil
LINE 38: would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories
LINE 39: of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price
LINE 40: of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder
LINE 41: riddles than that of the Sphinx.
LINE 42: They were early; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo
LINE 43: amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the
LINE 44: seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads,
LINE 45: and bonnets to match, discussing Woman's Rights and making tatting.
LINE 46: Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the
LINE 47: hand, a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an
LINE 48: old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On
LINE 49: her right, her only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a
LINE 50: newspaper.
LINE 51: It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,
LINE 52: idly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed
LINE 53: the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling
LINE 54: over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young
LINE 55: gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each
LINE 56: other close by, and a dishevelled female was flying away in the
LINE 57: background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw
LINE 58: her looking, and, with boyish good-nature, offered half his paper,
LINE 59: saying bluntly, "Want to read it? That's a first-rate story."
LINE 60: Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for
LINE 61: lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,
LINE 62: mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light
LINE 63: literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's
LINE 64: invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the
LINE 65: _dramatis personæ_, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.
LINE 66: "Prime, isn't it?" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last
LINE 67: paragraph of her portion.
LINE 68: "I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried," returned Jo,
LINE 69: amused at his admiration of the trash.
LINE 70: "I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good
LINE 71: living out of such stories, they say;" and he pointed to the name of
LINE 72: Mrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.
LINE 73: "Do you know her?" asked Jo, with sudden interest.
LINE 74: "No; but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the
LINE 75: office where this paper is printed."
LINE 76: "Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?" and Jo
LINE 77: looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly-sprinkled
LINE 78: exclamation-points that adorned the page.
LINE 79: "Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for
LINE 80: writing it."
LINE 81: Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Prof.
LINE 82: Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and
LINE 83: hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,
LINE 84: and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its
LINE 85: columns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the
LINE 86: audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the
LINE 87: first founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her
LINE 88: story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the
LINE 89: elopement or after the murder.
LINE 90: She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to
LINE 91: the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when
LINE 92: "genius took to burning." Jo had never tried this style before,
LINE 93: contenting herself with very mild romances for the "Spread Eagle." Her
LINE 94: theatrical experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for
LINE 95: they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,
LINE 96: and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her
LINE 97: limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to
LINE 98: make it, and, having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an
LINE 99: earthquake, as a striking and appropriate _dénouement_. The manuscript
LINE 100: was privately despatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if
LINE 101: the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she
LINE 102: would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.
LINE 103: Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to
LINE 104: keep a secret; but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all
LINE 105: hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
LINE 106: almost took her breath away; for on opening it, a check for a hundred
LINE 107: dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had
LINE 108: been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable
LINE 109: gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense
LINE 110: happiness he was giving a fellow-creature, I think he would devote his
LINE 111: leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement; for Jo valued the
LINE 112: letter more than the money, because it was encouraging; and after years
LINE 113: of effort it was _so_ pleasant to find that she had learned to do
LINE 114: something, though it was only to write a sensation story.
LINE 115: [Illustration: A check for one hundred dollars]
LINE 116: A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed
LINE 117: herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the
LINE 118: letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won
LINE 119: the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came
LINE 120: every one read and praised it; though after her father had told her that
LINE 121: the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy
LINE 122: quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way,--
LINE 123: "You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the
LINE 124: money."
LINE 125: "_I_ think the money is the best part of it. What _will_ you do with
LINE 126: such a fortune?" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a
LINE 127: reverential eye.
LINE 128: "Send Beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two," answered Jo
LINE 129: promptly.
LINE 130: "Oh, how splendid! No, I can't do it, dear, it would be so selfish,"
LINE 131: cried Beth, who had clapped her thin hands, and taken a long breath, as
LINE 132: if pining for fresh ocean-breezes; then stopped herself, and motioned
LINE 133: away the check which her sister waved before her.
LINE 134: "Ah, but you shall go, I've set my heart on it; that's what I tried for,
LINE 135: and that's why I succeeded. I never get on when I think of myself alone,
LINE 136: so it will help me to work for you, don't you see? Besides, Marmee needs
LINE 137: the change, and she won't leave you, so you _must_ go. Won't it be fun
LINE 138: to see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always
LINE 139: cures her patients!"
LINE 140: To the sea side they went, after much discussion; and though Beth didn't
LINE 141: come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,
LINE 142: while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was
LINE 143: satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with
LINE 144: a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She
LINE 145: did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the
LINE 146: house; for by the magic of a pen, her "rubbish" turned into comforts for
LINE 147: them all. "The Duke's Daughter" paid the butcher's bill, "A Phantom
LINE 148: Hand" put down a new carpet, and the "Curse of the Coventrys" proved the
LINE 149: blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.
LINE 150: Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny
LINE 151: side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction
LINE 152: which comes from hearty work of head or hand; and to the inspiration of
LINE 153: necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the
LINE 154: world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy
LINE 155: richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could
LINE 156: supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.
LINE 157: Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market; and,
LINE 158: encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and
LINE 159: fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her
LINE 160: confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three
LINE 161: publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut
LINE 162: it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly
LINE 163: admired.
LINE 164: "Now I must either bundle it back into my tin-kitchen to mould, pay for
LINE 165: printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers, and get what I can
LINE 166: for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more
LINE 167: convenient; so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important
LINE 168: subject," said Jo, calling a family council.
LINE 169: "Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,
LINE 170: and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen," was her
LINE 171: father's advice; and he practised as he preached, having waited
LINE 172: patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no
LINE 173: haste to gather it, even now, when it was sweet and mellow.
LINE 174: "It seems to me that Jo will profit more by making the trial than by
LINE 175: waiting," said Mrs. March. "Criticism is the best test of such work, for
LINE 176: it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her to do
LINE 177: better next time. We are too partial; but the praise and blame of
LINE 178: outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money."
LINE 179: "Yes," said Jo, knitting her brows, "that's just it; I've been fussing
LINE 180: over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or
LINE 181: indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons
LINE 182: take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it."
LINE 183: "I wouldn't leave out a word of it; you'll spoil it if you do, for the
LINE 184: interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the
LINE 185: people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,"
LINE 186: said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable
LINE 187: novel ever written.
LINE 188: "But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and
LINE 189: dramatic, and let the characters tell the story,'" interrupted Jo,
LINE 190: turning to the publisher's note.
LINE 191: "Do as he tells you; he knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a good,
LINE 192: popular book, and get as much money as you can. By and by, when, you've
LINE 193: got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and
LINE 194: metaphysical people in your novels," said Amy, who took a strictly
LINE 195: practical view of the subject.
LINE 196: "Well," said Jo, laughing, "if my people _are_ 'philosophical and
LINE 197: metaphysical,' it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,
LINE 198: except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some of his wise
LINE 199: ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth,
LINE 200: what do you say?"
LINE 201: "I should so like to see it printed _soon_," was all Beth said, and
LINE 202: smiled in saying it; but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last
LINE 203: word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike
LINE 204: candor, which chilled Jo's heart, for a minute, with a foreboding fear,
LINE 205: and decided her to make her little venture "soon."
LINE 206: So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on
LINE 207: her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of
LINE 208: pleasing every one, she took every one's advice; and, like the old man
LINE 209: and his donkey in the fable, suited nobody.
LINE 210: Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got
LINE 211: into it; so that was allowed to remain, though she had her doubts about
LINE 212: it. Her mother thought that there _was_ a trifle too much description;
LINE 213: out, therefore, it nearly all came, and with it many necessary links in
LINE 214: the story. Meg admired the tragedy; so Jo piled up the agony to suit
LINE 215: her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in
LINE 216: life, Jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the sombre
LINE 217: character of the story. Then, to complete the ruin, she cut it down one
LINE 218: third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked
LINE 219: robin, out into the big, busy world, to try its fate.
LINE 220: Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it; likewise
LINE 221: plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that
LINE 222: she was thrown into a state of bewilderment, from which it took her some
LINE 223: time to recover.
LINE 224: "You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when
LINE 225: it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising
LINE 226: book or broken all the ten commandments?" cried poor Jo, turning over a
LINE 227: heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one
LINE 228: minute, wrath and dire dismay the next. "This man says 'An exquisite
LINE 229: book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and
LINE 230: healthy,'" continued the perplexed authoress. "The next, 'The theory of
LINE 231: the book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and
LINE 232: unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't
LINE 233: believe in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don't see
LINE 234: how this critic _can_ be right. Another says, 'It's one of the best
LINE 235: American novels which has appeared for years' (I know better than that);
LINE 236: and the next asserts that 'though it is original, and written with great
LINE 237: force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun of
LINE 238: it, some over-praise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to
LINE 239: expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I wish I'd
LINE 240: printed it whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged."
LINE 241: Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally;
LINE 242: yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so
LINE 243: well, and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for those
LINE 244: whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an author's
LINE 245: best education; and when the first soreness was over, she could laugh at
LINE 246: her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel herself the
LINE 247: wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.
LINE 248: "Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me," she said stoutly;
LINE 249: "and I've got the joke on my side, after all; for the parts that were
LINE 250: taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,
LINE 251: and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced
LINE 252: 'charmingly natural, tender, and true.' So I'll comfort myself with
LINE 253: that; and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another."
