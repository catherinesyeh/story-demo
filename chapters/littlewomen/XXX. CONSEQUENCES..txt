LINE 1: Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was
LINE 2: considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be
LINE 3: invited to take a table, and every one was much interested in the
LINE 4: matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all
LINE 5: parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life,
LINE 6: and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily.
LINE 7: The "haughty, uninteresting creature" was let severely alone; but Amy's
LINE 8: talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art-table,
LINE 9: and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable
LINE 10: contributions to it.
LINE 11: Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened; then
LINE 12: there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost
LINE 13: impossible to avoid, when some five and twenty women, old and young,
LINE 14: with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.
LINE 15: May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater
LINE 16: favorite than herself, and, just at this time, several trifling
LINE 17: circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink
LINE 18: work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases,--that was one thorn; then
LINE 19: the all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy, at a late
LINE 20: party, and only once with May,--that was thorn number two; but the chief
LINE 21: grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her
LINE 22: unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered
LINE 23: to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the
LINE 24: blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had
LINE 25: been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had
LINE 26: permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits,
LINE 27: however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before
LINE 28: the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.
LINE 29: Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,
LINE 30: said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,--
LINE 31: "I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about
LINE 32: my giving this table to any one but my girls. As this is the most
LINE 33: prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are
LINE 34: the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take
LINE 35: this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in
LINE 36: the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have
LINE 37: another table if you like."
LINE 38: Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver
LINE 39: this little speech; but when the time came, she found it rather
LINE 40: difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking
LINE 41: straight at her, full of surprise and trouble.
LINE 42: Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what,
LINE 43: and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,--
LINE 44: "Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"
LINE 45: "Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg; it's merely a matter
LINE 46: of expediency, you see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this
LINE 47: table is considered their proper place. _I_ think it very appropriate
LINE 48: to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty;
LINE 49: but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that
LINE 50: you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower-table? The
LINE 51: little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a
LINE 52: charming thing of it, and the flower-table is always attractive, you
LINE 53: know."
LINE 54: "Especially to gentlemen," added May, with a look which enlightened Amy
LINE 55: as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but
LINE 56: took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered, with
LINE 57: unexpected amiability,--
LINE 58: "It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here at
LINE 59: once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."
LINE 60: "You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer," began
LINE 61: May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty
LINE 62: racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully
LINE 63: made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook
LINE 64: her meaning, and said quickly,--
LINE 65: "Oh, certainly, if they are in your way;" and sweeping her contributions
LINE 66: into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her
LINE 67: works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.
LINE 68: "Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, mamma,"
LINE 69: said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.
LINE 70: "Girls' quarrels are soon over," returned her mother, feeling a trifle
LINE 71: ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.
LINE 72: The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which
LINE 73: cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to
LINE 74: work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But
LINE 75: everything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; every one
LINE 76: was too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls
LINE 77: were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many
LINE 78: magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to
LINE 79: preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm
LINE 80: after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her
LINE 81: head when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of
LINE 82: water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her
LINE 83: hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draught, which last
LINE 84: affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl-reader
LINE 85: who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy, and
LINE 86: wish her well through with her task.
LINE 87: There was great indignation at home when she told her story that
LINE 88: evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done
LINE 89: right; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all; and Jo demanded
LINE 90: why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to
LINE 91: get on without her.
LINE 92: "Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things,
LINE 93: and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it.
LINE 94: They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won't
LINE 95: they, Marmee?"
LINE 96: "That's the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best,
LINE 97: though it's not very easy to give it sometimes," said her mother, with
LINE 98: the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and
LINE 99: practising.
LINE 100: In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,
LINE 101: Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her
LINE 102: enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came
LINE 103: to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table
LINE 104: that morning, while the little girls were in an ante-room filling the
LINE 105: baskets, she took up her pet production,--a little book, the antique
LINE 106: cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which,
LINE 107: on leaves of vellum, she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As
LINE 108: she turned the pages, rich in dainty devices, with very pardonable
LINE 109: pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed
LINE 110: in a brilliant scroll-work of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little
LINE 111: spirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns
LINE 112: and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
LINE 113: "I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright
LINE 114: page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not
LINE 115: hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute,
LINE 116: turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for
LINE 117: all heart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true
LINE 118: sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street,
LINE 119: school, office, or home; even a fair-table may become a pulpit, if it
LINE 120: can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.
LINE 121: Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and
LINE 122: there; and she did what many of us do not always do,--took the sermon to
LINE 123: heart, and straightway put it in practice.
LINE 124: A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty
LINE 125: things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their
LINE 126: voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the
LINE 127: story, and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit
LINE 128: had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She
LINE 129: heard May say sorrowfully,--
LINE 130: "It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't
LINE 131: want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then:
LINE 132: now it's spoilt."
LINE 133: "I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her," suggested some one.
LINE 134: "How could I after all the fuss?" began May, but she did not finish, for
LINE 135: Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly,--
LINE 136: "You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was
LINE 137: just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table
LINE 138: rather than mine. Here they are; please take them, and forgive me if I
LINE 139: was hasty in carrying them away last night."
LINE 140: As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and
LINE 141: hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing
LINE 142: than it was to stay and be thanked for it.
LINE 143: "Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?" cried one girl.
LINE 144: May's answer was inaudible; but another young lady, whose temper was
LINE 145: evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable
LINE 146: laugh, "Very lovely; for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own
LINE 147: table."
LINE 148: Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them
LINE 149: appreciated, at least; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,
LINE 150: feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is,--as she
LINE 151: presently discovered; for her spirits began to rise, and her table to
LINE 152: blossom under her skilful hands; the girls were very kind, and that one
LINE 153: little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.
LINE 154: It was a very long day, and a hard one to Amy, as she sat behind her
LINE 155: table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon: few
LINE 156: cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long
LINE 157: before night.
LINE 158: The art-table _was_ the most attractive in the room; there was a crowd
LINE 159: about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro
LINE 160: with important faces and rattling money-boxes. Amy often looked
LINE 161: wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy,
LINE 162: instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to
LINE 163: some of us; but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious,
LINE 164: but very trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by
LINE 165: her family, and Laurie and his friends, made it a real martyrdom.
LINE 166: She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet
LINE 167: that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no
LINE 168: complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her
LINE 169: an extra cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming
LINE 170: little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting
LINE 171: herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were
LINE 172: about to be turned.
LINE 173: "Don't do anything rude, pray, Jo. I won't have any fuss made, so let it
LINE 174: all pass, and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed early,
LINE 175: hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little
LINE 176: table.
LINE 177: "I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I
LINE 178: know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his
LINE 179: boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet," returned Jo,
LINE 180: leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp
LINE 181: was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.
LINE 182: "Is that my boy?"
LINE 183: "As sure as this is my girl!" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm,
LINE 184: with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.
LINE 185: "O Teddy, such doings!" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.
LINE 186: "A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by, and I'll be
LINE 187: hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down
LINE 188: before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her cause with
LINE 189: warmth.
LINE 190: "The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not
LINE 191: arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn't
LINE 192: wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean thing they are
LINE 193: very likely to do another," observed Jo, in a disgusted tone.
LINE 194: "Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to."
LINE 195: "I didn't know that; he forgot, I suppose; and, as your grandpa was
LINE 196: poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some."
LINE 197: "Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking! They are
LINE 198: just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in everything?"
LINE 199: began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.
LINE 200: "Gracious, I hope not! half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at
LINE 201: all. But we mustn't stand philandering here; I've got to help Amy, so
LINE 202: you go and make yourself splendid; and if you'll be so very kind as to
LINE 203: let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you
LINE 204: forever."
LINE 205: "Couldn't you do it now?" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the
LINE 206: gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars,
LINE 207: "Go away, Teddy; I'm busy."
LINE 208: Thanks to the conspirators, the tables _were_ turned that night; for
LINE 209: Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket, arranged in
LINE 210: his best manner, for a centre-piece; then the March family turned out
LINE 211: _en masse_, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only
LINE 212: came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and
LINE 213: apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends
LINE 214: gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,
LINE 215: encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in
LINE 216: the room. Amy was in her element now, and, out of gratitude, if nothing
LINE 217: more, was as sprightly and gracious as possible,--coming to the
LINE 218: conclusion, about that time, that virtue _was_ its own reward, after
LINE 219: all.
LINE 220: [Illustration: Bought up the bouquets]
LINE 221: Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety; and when Amy was happily
LINE 222: surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the hall, picking
LINE 223: up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the
LINE 224: Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the
LINE 225: ill-feeling, and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible; she also
LINE 226: discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and
LINE 227: considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art-table, she
LINE 228: glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no signs of them.
LINE 229: "Tucked away out of sight, I dare say," thought Jo, who could forgive
LINE 230: her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered to her family.
LINE 231: "Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?" asked May, with a
LINE 232: conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be
LINE 233: generous.
LINE 234: "She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is
LINE 235: enjoying herself. The flower-table is always attractive, you know,
LINE 236: 'especially to gentlemen.'"
LINE 237: Jo _couldn't_ resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly
LINE 238: she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases,
LINE 239: which still remained unsold.
LINE 240: "Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for
LINE 241: father," said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.
LINE 242: "Everything of Amy's sold long ago; I took care that the right people
LINE 243: saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us," returned
LINE 244: May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy, that
LINE 245: day.
LINE 246: Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news; and Amy looked
LINE 247: both touched and surprised by the report of May's words and manner.
LINE 248: "Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables
LINE 249: as generously as you have by mine--especially the art-table," she said,
LINE 250: ordering out "Teddy's Own," as the girls called the college friends.
LINE 251: "'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table; but do your
LINE 252: duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of _art_ in every sense
LINE 253: of the word," said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared
LINE 254: to take the field.
LINE 255: "To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," said little
LINE 256: Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting
LINE 257: promptly quenched by Laurie, who said, "Very well, my son, for a small
LINE 258: boy!" and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.
LINE 259: "Buy the vases," whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of
LINE 260: fire on her enemy's head.
LINE 261: To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but
LINE 262: pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen
LINE 263: speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and
LINE 264: wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted
LINE 265: fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.
LINE 266: Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said
LINE 267: something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam
LINE 268: with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and
LINE 269: anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till
LINE 270: several days later.
LINE 271: The fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy good night, she
LINE 272: did not "gush" as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look
LINE 273: which said, "Forgive and forget." That satisfied Amy; and when she got
LINE 274: home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney-piece, with a
LINE 275: great bouquet in each. "The reward of merit for a magnanimous March," as
LINE 276: Laurie announced with a flourish.
LINE 277: "You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character
LINE 278: than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I
LINE 279: respect you with all my heart," said Jo warmly, as they brushed their
LINE 280: hair together late that night.
LINE 281: "Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must
LINE 282: have been dreadfully hard, after working so long, and setting your heart
LINE 283: on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done it
LINE 284: as kindly as you did," added Beth from her pillow.
LINE 285: "Why, girls, you needn't praise me so; I only did as I'd be done by. You
LINE 286: laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true
LINE 287: gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know
LINE 288: how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little
LINE 289: meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far from
LINE 290: it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what mother is."
LINE 291: Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug,--
LINE 292: "I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You
LINE 293: are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in
LINE 294: true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away,
LINE 295: deary; you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more
LINE 296: delighted than I shall."
LINE 297: A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be
LINE 298: delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was
LINE 299: illuminated to such a degree, when she read it, that Jo and Beth, who
LINE 300: were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.
LINE 301: "Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants--"
LINE 302: "Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an
LINE 303: uncontrollable rapture.
LINE 304: "No, dear, not you; it's Amy."
LINE 305: "O mother! she's too young; it's my turn first. I've wanted it so
LINE 306: long--it would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid--I
LINE 307: _must_ go."
LINE 308: "I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not
LINE 309: for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."
LINE 310: "It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't
LINE 311: fair, oh, it isn't fair!" cried Jo passionately.
LINE 312: "I'm afraid it is partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the
LINE 313: other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit;
LINE 314: and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said,--'I planned
LINE 315: at first to ask Jo; but as "favors burden her," and she "hates French,"
LINE 316: I think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a
LINE 317: good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may
LINE 318: give her.'"
LINE 319: "Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! why can't I learn to keep it
LINE 320: quiet?" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When
LINE 321: she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said
LINE 322: sorrowfully,--
LINE 323: "I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time; so
LINE 324: try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by reproaches
LINE 325: or regrets."
LINE 326: "I'll try," said Jo, winking hard, as she knelt down to pick up the
LINE 327: basket she had joyfully upset. "I'll take a leaf out of her book, and
LINE 328: try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute
LINE 329: of happiness; but it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful
LINE 330: disappointment;" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held
LINE 331: with several very bitter tears.
LINE 332: "Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you
LINE 333: are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all,
LINE 334: with such a clinging touch and loving face, that Jo felt comforted in
LINE 335: spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and
LINE 336: humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how
LINE 337: gratefully she would bear it.
LINE 338: By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family
LINE 339: jubilation; not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without
LINE 340: repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received the
LINE 341: news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,
LINE 342: and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving
LINE 343: such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
LINE 344: visions of art than herself.
LINE 345: "It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said impressively, as
LINE 346: she scraped her best palette. "It will decide my career; for if I have
LINE 347: any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove
LINE 348: it."
LINE 349: "Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new
LINE 350: collars which were to be handed over to Amy.
LINE 351: "Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living," replied the
LINE 352: aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure; but she made a wry face
LINE 353: at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on
LINE 354: vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.
LINE 355: "No, you won't; you hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and
LINE 356: come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days," said Jo.
LINE 357: "Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one
LINE 358: will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I
LINE 359: should like to be able to help those who are," said Amy, smiling, as if
LINE 360: the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor
LINE 361: drawing-teacher.
LINE 362: "Hum!" said Jo, with a sigh; "if you wish it you'll have it, for your
LINE 363: wishes are always granted--mine never."
LINE 364: "Would you like to go?" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with
LINE 365: her knife.
LINE 366: "Rather!"
LINE 367: "Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum
LINE 368: for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times."
LINE 369: "Thank you; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes,
LINE 370: if it ever does," returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer
LINE 371: as gratefully as she could.
LINE 372: There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment
LINE 373: till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue
LINE 374: ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried
LINE 375: till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the
LINE 376: steamer sailed; then, just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it
LINE 377: suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her
LINE 378: and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last
LINE 379: lingerer, saying with a sob,--
LINE 380: "Oh, take care of them for me; and if anything should happen--"
LINE 381: "I will, dear, I will; and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort
LINE 382: you," whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to
LINE 383: keep his word.
LINE 384: So Amy sailed away to find the old world, which is always new and
LINE 385: beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from
LINE 386: the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall
LINE 387: the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see
LINE 388: nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.
