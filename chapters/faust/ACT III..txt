LINE 1: Scene I.
LINE 2: _Auerbach's Wine-cellar, Leipzig._
LINE 3: _A Bout of Merry Fellows._
LINE 4: Frosch.
LINE 5: Will no one sing? none crack a joke?
LINE 6: I'll teach you to make saucy faces!
LINE 7: Like old wet straw to-day you smoke,
LINE 8: While bright as flame your wonted blaze is.
LINE 9: Brander.
LINE 10: The blame lies with yourself, for you have given us
LINE 11: To-day no fun nor frolic to enliven us.
LINE 12: Frosch. [_throwing a glass of wine over his head_]
LINE 13: There hast thou both!
LINE 14: Brander.
LINE 15: Double swine!
LINE 16: Frosch.
LINE 17: You asked a joke--I gave it you in wine!
LINE 18: Siebel.
LINE 19: Out at the door with all who dare to quarrel!
LINE 20: Give all your pipes full play! this is no place to snarl.
LINE 21: Up! hollo! ho!
LINE 22: Altmayer.
LINE 23: Woe's me! the devil and his crew are here!
LINE 24: Some cotton, ho! he makes my ear-drum crack.
LINE 25: Siebel.
LINE 26: Roar on! for, when the vault loud echoes back,
LINE 27: The deep bass notes come thundering on the ear.
LINE 28: Frosch.
LINE 29: Right, right! out with each saucy fellow!
LINE 30: A! tara lara da!
LINE 31: Altmayer.
LINE 32: A tara lara da!
LINE 33: Frosch.
LINE 34: Our throats are now quite mellow.
LINE 35: [_Sings._] The holy Roman empire now,
LINE 36: How does it hold together?
LINE 37: A clumsy song!--fie! a political song!
LINE 38: A scurvy song! thank God, with each to-morrow,
LINE 39: The Roman empire can give you small sorrow;
LINE 40: For me, I deem I'm wealthier and wiser
LINE 41: For being neither Chancellor nor Kaiser.
LINE 42: Yet even we must have a head to rule us;
LINE 43: Let's choose a pope in drinking well to school us,
LINE 44: Come, well you know the qualification
LINE 45: That lifts a man to consideration.
LINE 46: Frosch. [_sings_]
LINE 47: Mount up, lady nightingale,
LINE 48: Greet my love ten thousand times!
LINE 49: Siebel.
LINE 50: No, sir, not once,--I'll hear no more of this.
LINE 51: Frosch.
LINE 52: But you _shall_ hear!--A greeting and a kiss!
LINE 53: [_He sings._] Ope the door in silent night.
LINE 54: Ope and let me in, I pray;
LINE 55: Shut the door, the morn is bright,
LINE 56: Shut it, love, I must away!
LINE 57: Siebel.
LINE 58: Yes! sing and sing! belaud her, and berhyme!
LINE 59: I'll have my laugh at that--all in good time!
LINE 60: She jilted me right rarely; soon
LINE 61: She'll make thee sing to the same tune;
LINE 62: 'Twere fit a Kobold with his love should bless her,
LINE 63: On some cross-road to cocker and caress her;
LINE 64: Or that some old he-goat, that tramps away
LINE 65: From merry Blocksberg on the first of May,
LINE 66: Should greet her passing with a lusty baa!
LINE 67: An honest man of genuine flesh and blood
LINE 68: Is for the wench by far too good.
LINE 69: Batter her doors, her windows shiver,
LINE 70: That's all the serenade I'd give her!
LINE 71: Brander. [_striking the table_]
LINE 72: Gentlemen, hear! only attend to me,
LINE 73: You'll see that I know how to live.
LINE 74: If love-sick people here there be,
LINE 75: To honor them, I'm bound to give
LINE 76: A song brimful of the most melting passion.
LINE 77: I'll sing a ditty of the newest fashion!
LINE 78: Give ear! and with full swell sonorous,
LINE 79: Let each and all ring forth the chorus!
LINE 80: [_He sings._] In a pantry-hole there lived a rat,
LINE 81: On bacon and on butter,
LINE 82: It had a paunch as round and fat
LINE 83: As Doctor Martin Luther.
LINE 84: The cook placed poison in its way,
LINE 85: It felt as straitened all the day,
LINE 86: As if it had love in its body.
LINE 87: Chorus. [_shouting_]
LINE 88: As if it had love in its body.
LINE 89: Brander.
LINE 90: It ran within, it ran without,
LINE 91: And sipped in every puddle;
LINE 92: And scratched and gnawed, but bettered not
LINE 93: The fever of its noddle.
LINE 94: With many a twinge it tossed and tossed,
LINE 95: Seemed ready to give up the ghost,
LINE 96: As if it had love in its body.
LINE 97: Chorus.
LINE 98: As if it had love in its body.
LINE 99: Brander.
LINE 100: It left its hole for very pain,
LINE 101: Into the kitchen crawling,
LINE 102: And snuffling there with might and main,
LINE 103: Upon the earth lay sprawling.
LINE 104: The cook she laughed when she saw it die;
LINE 105: "It squeaks," quoth she, "with its latest sigh,
LINE 106: As if it had love in its body."
LINE 107: Chorus.
LINE 108: As if it had love in its body.
LINE 109: Siebel.
LINE 110: How the hard-hearted boys rejoice!
LINE 111: As if it were a trade so choice
LINE 112: To teach the rats and mice to die!
LINE 113: Brander.
LINE 114: Rats find great favor in your eyes.
LINE 115: Altmayer.
LINE 116: The oily paunch! the bald pate! he
LINE 117: Has eyes of sorrow for the creature:
LINE 118: For why? he could not fail to see
LINE 119: In the swoll'n rat his own best feature!
LINE 120: Scene II.
LINE 121: _Enter_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 122: Mephistopheles.
LINE 123: First thing of all I bring you here,
LINE 124: Into a company of jolly cheer,
LINE 125: That you may learn how men contrive
LINE 126: Without much thought or care to live.
LINE 127: These fellows feast their lives away
LINE 128: In a continual holiday;
LINE 129: With little wit and much content
LINE 130: Their narrow round of life is spent,
LINE 131: As playful kittens oft are found
LINE 132: To chase their own tails round and round.
LINE 133: So live they on from day to day,
LINE 134: As long as headache keeps away,
LINE 135: And by no anxious thought are crossed,
LINE 136: While they get credit from the host.
LINE 137: Brander.
LINE 138: These gentlemen are strangers; in their face
LINE 139: One reads they lack the breeding of the place;
LINE 140: They're not an hour arrived, I warrant thee.
LINE 141: Frosch.
LINE 142: There you are right!--Leipzig's the place, I say!
LINE 143: It is a little Paris in its way.
LINE 144: Siebel.
LINE 145: What, think you, may the strangers be?
LINE 146: Frosch.
LINE 147: Leave that to me!--I'll soon fish out the truth.
LINE 148: Fill me a bumper till it overflows,
LINE 149: And then I'll draw the worms out of their nose,
LINE 150: As easily as 'twere an infant's tooth.
LINE 151: To me they seem to be of noble blood,
LINE 152: They look so discontented and so proud.
LINE 153: Brander.
LINE 154: Quack doctors both!--Altmayer, what think you?
LINE 155: Altmayer.
LINE 156: 'Tis like.
LINE 157: Frosch.
LINE 158: Mark me! I'll make them feel the screw.
LINE 159: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 160: They have no nose to smell the devil out,
LINE 161: Even when he has them by the snout.
LINE 162: Faust.
LINE 163: Be greeted, gentlemen!
LINE 164: Siebel.
LINE 165: With much respect return we the salute.
LINE 166: [_Softly, eyeing_ /Mephistopheles/ _from the one side._]
LINE 167: What! does the fellow limp upon one foot?
LINE 168: Mephistopheles.
LINE 169: With your permission, we will make so free,
LINE 170: As to intrude upon your company.
LINE 171: The host's poor wines may keep us in sobriety,
LINE 172: But we at least enjoy your good society.
LINE 173: Altmayer.
LINE 174: Our wine is good; and, for to speak the truth,
LINE 175: Your mother fed you with too nice a tooth.
LINE 176: Frosch.
LINE 177: When left you Rippach? you must have been pressed
LINE 178: For time. Supped you with Squire Hans by the way?[*n7]
LINE 179: Mephistopheles.
LINE 180: We had no time to stay!
LINE 181: But when I last came by, I was his guest.
LINE 182: He spoke much of his cousins, and he sent
LINE 183: To you and all full many a compliment.
LINE 184: [_He makes a bow to_ /Frosch/.
LINE 185: Altmayer. [_softly_]
LINE 186: You have him there!--he understands the jest!
LINE 187: Siebel.
LINE 188: He is a knowing one!
LINE 189: Frosch.
LINE 190: I'll sift him through anon!
LINE 191: Mephistopheles.
LINE 192: As we came in, a concert struck my ear
LINE 193: Of skilful voices in a chorus pealing!
LINE 194: A gleesome song must sound most nobly here,
LINE 195: Re-echoed freely from the vaulted ceiling.
LINE 196: Frosch.
LINE 197: Perhaps you have yourself some skill?
LINE 198: Mephistopheles.
LINE 199: O no! had I the power, I should not want the will.
LINE 200: Altmayer.
LINE 201: Give us a song!
LINE 202: Mephistopheles.
LINE 203: A thousand, willingly!
LINE 204: Siebel.
LINE 205: Only brand-new, I say!--no thread-bare strain!
LINE 206: Mephistopheles.
LINE 207: We are but just come from a tour in Spain,
LINE 208: The lovely land of wine and melody.
LINE 209: [_He sings._] There was a king in old times
LINE 210: That had a huge big flea--
LINE 211: Frosch.
LINE 212: Ha, ha! a flea!--he seems a man of taste!
LINE 213: A flea, I wis, is a most dainty guest?
LINE 214: Mephistopheles. [_sings again_]
LINE 215: There was a king in old times
LINE 216: That had a huge big flea,
LINE 217: As if it were his own son,
LINE 218: He loved it mightily.
LINE 219: He sent out for the tailor,
LINE 220: To get it a suit of clothes;
LINE 221: He made my lord a dress-coat,
LINE 222: He made him a pair of hose.
LINE 223: Brander.
LINE 224: Be sure that Monsieur le Tailleur be told
LINE 225: To take his measure most exact and nice,
LINE 226: And as upon his head he puts a price,
LINE 227: To make the hose without or crease or fold!
LINE 228: Mephistopheles.
LINE 229: In velvet and in silk clad
LINE 230: He strutted proudly then,
LINE 231: And showed his star and garter
LINE 232: With titled gentlemen.
LINE 233: Prime minister they made him,
LINE 234: With cross and ribbon gay,
LINE 235: And then all his relations
LINE 236: At court had much to say.
LINE 237: This caused no small vexation
LINE 238: At court; I tell you true--
LINE 239: The queen and all her ladies
LINE 240: Were bitten black and blue.
LINE 241: And yet they durst not catch them,
LINE 242: Nor crack them, when they might,
LINE 243: But we are free to catch them,
LINE 244: And crack them when they bite.
LINE 245: Chorus. [_shouting_]
LINE 246: But we are free to catch them
LINE 247: And crack them when they bite!
LINE 248: Frosch.
LINE 249: Bravo, bravo!--his voice is quite divine.
LINE 250: Siebel.
LINE 251: Such fate may every flea befall!
LINE 252: Brander.
LINE 253: Point your nails and crack 'em all!
LINE 254: Altmayer.
LINE 255: A glass to liberty!--long live the vine!
LINE 256: Mephistopheles.
LINE 257: I'd drink to liberty with right good will,
LINE 258: If we had only better wine to drink.
LINE 259: Siebel.
LINE 260: You might have kept that to yourself, I think!
LINE 261: Mephistopheles.
LINE 262: I only fear our host might take it ill,
LINE 263: Else should I give to every honored guest
LINE 264: From our own cellar of the very best.
LINE 265: Siebel.
LINE 266: O never fear!--If you but find the wine,
LINE 267: Our host shall be content--the risk be mine!
LINE 268: Frosch.
LINE 269: Give me a flowing glass, and praise you shall not want,
LINE 270: So that your sample, mark me! be not scant;
LINE 271: I cannot judge of wine, unless I fill
LINE 272: My mouth and throat too with a goodly swill.
LINE 273: Altmayer. [_softly_]
LINE 274: I see the gentlemen are from the Rhine.
LINE 275: Mephistopheles.
LINE 276: Give me a gimlet here!--I'll show you wine.
LINE 277: Brander.
LINE 278: What would the fellow bore?
LINE 279: Has he then wine-casks at the door?
LINE 280: Altmayer.
LINE 281: There, in the basket, you will find a store
LINE 282: Of tools, which our good landlord sometimes uses.
LINE 283: Mephistopheles. [_Taking the gimlet._]
LINE 284: [_To_ /Frosch/.] Now every man may taste of what he chooses.
LINE 285: Frosch.
LINE 286: How mean you that? Can you afford?
LINE 287: Mephistopheles.
LINE 288: No fear of that; my cellar is well stored.
LINE 289: Altmayer. [_to_ /Frosch/]
LINE 290: Aha! I see you smack your lips already.
LINE 291: Frosch.
LINE 292: I'll have Rhine wine; what fatherland produces
LINE 293: Is better far than French or Spanish juices.
LINE 294: Mephistopheles. [_boring a hole in the edge of the table where
LINE 295: /Frosch/ is sitting_]
LINE 296: Fetch me some wax, to make the stoppers ready.
LINE 297: Altmayer.
LINE 298: He means to put us off with jugglery.
LINE 299: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Brander/]
LINE 300: And you, sir, what?
LINE 301: Brander.
LINE 302: Champagne for me!
LINE 303: And brisk and foaming let it be!
LINE 304: [/Mephistopheles/ _bores; meanwhile one of the party has got
LINE 305: the stoppers ready, and closes the holes._
LINE 306: Brander.
LINE 307: To foreign climes a man must sometimes roam,
LINE 308: In quest of things he cannot find at home;
LINE 309: For Frenchmen Germans have no strong affection,
LINE 310: But to their wines we seldom make objection.
LINE 311: Siebel. [_while_ /Mephistopheles/ _is coming round to him_]
LINE 312: I have no taste for your sour wines to-day,
LINE 313: I wish to have a swig of good Tokay.
LINE 314: Mephistopheles. [_boring_]
LINE 315: That you shall have, and of the very best.
LINE 316: Altmayer.
LINE 317: No, gentlemen!--'tis plain you mean to jest;
LINE 318: If so, in me you much mistake your man.
LINE 319: Mephistopheles.
LINE 320: Ha! ha!--no little risk, methinks, I ran,
LINE 321: To venture tricks with noble guests like you.
LINE 322: Come! make your choice, speak boldly out, and I
LINE 323: Will do my best your wish to gratify.
LINE 324: Altmayer.
LINE 325: Give me what wine you please!--only not much ado.
LINE 326: [_After having bored and stopped up all the holes._
LINE 327: Mephistopheles. [_with strange gestures_]
LINE 328: Grapes on the vine grow!
LINE 329: Horns on the goat!
LINE 330: The wine is juicy, the vine is of wood,
LINE 331: The wooden table can give it as good.
LINE 332: Look into Nature's depths with me!
LINE 333: Whoso hath faith shall wonders see!
LINE 334: Now draw the corks, and quaff the wine!
LINE 335: All. [_drawing the corks, and quaffing the out-streaming liquor each
LINE 336: as he had desired_]
LINE 337: O blessed stream!--O fount divine!
LINE 338: Mephistopheles.
LINE 339: Drink on! only be cautious in your hurry.
LINE 340: [_They drink freely._
LINE 341: All. [_singing_]
LINE 342: No king of cannibals to day
LINE 343: More bravely rules the drinking bout,
LINE 344: Than we, when, like five hundred swine,
LINE 345: We drain the brimming bumpers out!
LINE 346: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 347: Look at the fellows now!--are they not merry?
LINE 348: Faust.
LINE 349: I feel inclined to go!--'tis getting late.
LINE 350: Mephistopheles.
LINE 351: Soon shall we have a glorious revelation
LINE 352: Of the pure beast in man, if you but wait.
LINE 353: Siebel. [_drinks carelessly; the wine falls to the ground and becomes
LINE 354: flame_]
LINE 355: Help! fire! the devil's here! death and damnation!
LINE 356: Mephistopheles. [_Addressing himself to the flames_]
LINE 357: Peace, friendly element! be still!
LINE 358: [_To the company._] This time 'twas but a spurt of purgatorial flame.
LINE 359: Siebel.
LINE 360: What's that?--you little know your men; we'll tame
LINE 361: Your impudence, you juggling knave, we will!
LINE 362: Frosch.
LINE 363: 'Twere dangerous to repeat such gambols here!
LINE 364: Altmayer.
LINE 365: Methinks 'twere best to whisper in his ear
LINE 366: That he had better leave the room.
LINE 367: Siebel.
LINE 368: What, sirrah? do you then presume
LINE 369: To play your hocus-pocus here?
LINE 370: Mephistopheles.
LINE 371: Peace, old wine-cask!
LINE 372: Siebel.
LINE 373: You broomstick, you!
LINE 374: Must we then bear your insolence too?
LINE 375: Brander.
LINE 376: Wait! wait! it shall rain blows anon!
LINE 377: Altmayer. [_draws a stopper from the table, and fire rushes
LINE 378: out on him_]
LINE 379: I burn! I burn!
LINE 380: Siebel.
LINE 381: There's witchcraft in his face!
LINE 382: The fellow's an outlaw! strike him down!
LINE 383: [_They draw their knives and attack_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 384: Mephistopheles. [_with serious mien_]
LINE 385: False be eye, and false be ear!
LINE 386: Change the sense, and change the place!
LINE 387: Now be there, and now be here!
LINE 388: [_They look as thunderstruck, and stare at one another._
LINE 389: Altmayer.
LINE 390: Where am I? in what lovely land?
LINE 391: Frosch.
LINE 392: Vineyards! can it be so?
LINE 393: Siebel.
LINE 394: And grapes too quite at hand!
LINE 395: Brander.
LINE 396: And here beneath this shady tree,
LINE 397: This noble vine, these blushing clusters see!
LINE 398: [_He seizes_ /Siebel/ _by the nose. The rest seize one another in the
LINE 399: same manner, and lift up their knives._
LINE 400: Mephistopheles. [_as above_]
LINE 401: Let Error now their eyes unclose,
LINE 402: The devil's joke to understand!
LINE 403: [_He vanishes with_ /Faust/. _The fellows start back from one another._
LINE 404: Siebel.
LINE 405: What's the matter?
LINE 406: Altmayer.
LINE 407: How now?
LINE 408: Frosch.
LINE 409: Was that your nose?
LINE 410: Brander. [_to_ /Siebel/]
LINE 411: And yours is in my hand!
LINE 412: Altmayer.
LINE 413: It was a stroke shot through my every limb!
LINE 414: Give me a chair!--I faint! My eyes grow dim!
LINE 415: Frosch.
LINE 416: Now tell me only what has been the matter?
LINE 417: Siebel.
LINE 418: Where is the fellow? Could I catch him here,
LINE 419: His life out of his body I should batter!
LINE 420: Altmayer.
LINE 421: I saw him just this instant disappear,
LINE 422: Riding upon a wine-cask--I declare
LINE 423: I feel a weight like lead about my feet.
LINE 424: [_Turning to the table._]
LINE 425: I wonder if his d----d wine still be there!
LINE 426: Siebel.
LINE 427: There's not a single drop; 'twas all a cheat.
LINE 428: Frosch.
LINE 429: And yet methinks that I was drinking wine.
LINE 430: Brander.
LINE 431: And I could swear I saw a clustered vine.
LINE 432: Altmayer.
LINE 433: Let none now say the age of miracles is past!
LINE 434: Scene III.
LINE 435: _Witches' Kitchen._
LINE 436: _A caldron is seen boiling on a low hearth. Numbers of strange
LINE 437: fantastic figures tumbling up and down in the smoke. A
LINE 438: Mother_-/Cat-Ape/[*n8] _sits beside the caldron, taking off the
LINE 439: scum, and keeping it from boiling over. An Old_ /Cat-Ape/ _beside
LINE 440: her warming himself with his young ones. Roof and walls are covered
LINE 441: over with a strange assortment of furniture, and implements used by
LINE 442: witches._
LINE 443: _Enter_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles./
LINE 444: Faust.
LINE 445: I cannot brook this brainless bedlam stuff!
LINE 446: And must it be that I shall cast my slough
LINE 447: In this hotbed of all unreasoned doing?
LINE 448: Shall an old beldam give me what I lack?
LINE 449: And can her pots and pans, with all their brewing,
LINE 450: Shake off full thirty summers from my back?
LINE 451: Woe's me, if thou canst boast no better scheme!
LINE 452: My brightest hopes are vanished as a dream.
LINE 453: Has Nature then, and has some noble Spirit,
LINE 454: No balsam for the body to repair it?
LINE 455: Mephistopheles.
LINE 456: My friend, with your great sense I cannot but be smitten!
LINE 457: Nature, too, boasts a plan to renovate your age;
LINE 458: But in a wondrous volume it is written,
LINE 459: And wondrous is the chapter and the page.
LINE 460: Faust.
LINE 461: But I must know it.
LINE 462: Mephistopheles.
LINE 463: Good! the poorest man may try it,
LINE 464: Without or witch, or quack, or gold to buy it;
LINE 465: And yet it works a certain cure.
LINE 466: Go take thee with the peasant to the moor,
LINE 467: And straight begin to hew and hack;
LINE 468: Confine thee there, with patient mood,
LINE 469: Within the narrow beaten track,
LINE 470: And nourish thee with simplest food;
LINE 471: Live with the brute a brute, and count it not too low
LINE 472: To dung the corn-fields thine own hands shall mow;
LINE 473: Than this I know on earth no med'cine stronger,
LINE 474: To make, by fourscore years, both soul and body younger!
LINE 475: Faust.
LINE 476: I was not trained to this--was never made
LINE 477: To labor with the pick-axe and the spade;
LINE 478: Such narrow round of life I may not brook.
LINE 479: Mephistopheles.
LINE 480: Then you must look into another book,
LINE 481: And be content to take the witch for cook.
LINE 482: Faust.
LINE 483: But why this self-same ugly Jezebel?
LINE 484: Could you not brew the drink yourself as well?
LINE 485: Mephistopheles.
LINE 486: A precious pastime that indeed! meanwhile
LINE 487: I had built bridges many a German mile.
LINE 488: Not art, and science strict, are here enough,
LINE 489: But patience too, and perseverance tough.
LINE 490: A thoughtful soul toils on through many a silent year.
LINE 491: Time only makes the busy ferment clear,
LINE 492: Besides that the ingredients all
LINE 493: Are passing strange and mystical!
LINE 494: 'Tis true the devil taught them how to do it,
LINE 495: But not the devil with his own hands can brew it.
LINE 496: [_Looking at the_ /Cat-Apes/.] Lo! what a tiny gay parade!
LINE 497: Here's the man, and there's the maid!
LINE 498: [_Addressing them._] It seems that your good mother has gone out?
LINE 499: The Cat-Apes.
LINE 500: Up the chimney,
LINE 501: Went she out,
LINE 502: To a drinking bout!
LINE 503: Mephistopheles.
LINE 504: Is it her wont to gossip long without?
LINE 505: The Animals.
LINE 506: As long as we sit here and warm our feet.
LINE 507: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 508: What think you of the brutes? are they not neat?
LINE 509: Faust.
LINE 510: I never saw such tasteless would-be-drolls!
LINE 511: Mephistopheles.
LINE 512: Pooh! pooh!--I know no greater delectation
LINE 513: On earth, than such a merry conversation.
LINE 514: [_To the brutes._] Now let us hear, you pretty dolls,
LINE 515: What are you stirring there in the pot?
LINE 516: The Brutes.
LINE 517: Soup for beggars, hissing and hot,
LINE 518: Thin and watery, that's the stew.
LINE 519: Mephistopheles.
LINE 520: Your customers will not be few.
LINE 521: The Father Cat-Ape. [_comes up and fawns upon_ /Mephistopheles/]
LINE 522: Come rattle the dice,
LINE 523: Make me rich in a trice,
LINE 524: Come, come, let me gain!
LINE 525: My case is so bad,
LINE 526: It scarce could be worse:
LINE 527: Were I right in my purse,
LINE 528: I'd be right in my brain!
LINE 529: Mephistopheles.
LINE 530: How happy would the apish creature be,
LINE 531: To buy a ticket in the lottery!
LINE 532: [_Meanwhile the young_ /Cat-Apes/ _have been playing with a large
LINE 533: globe, and roll it forwards._
LINE 534: The Father Cat-Ape.
LINE 535: Such is the world,
LINE 536: So doth it go,
LINE 537: Up and down,
LINE 538: To and fro!
LINE 539: Like glass it tinkles,
LINE 540: Like glass it twinkles,
LINE 541: Breaks in a minute,
LINE 542: Has nothing within it;
LINE 543: Here it sparkles,
LINE 544: There it darkles,
LINE 545: I am alive!
LINE 546: My dear son, I say,
LINE 547: Keep out of the way!
LINE 548: If you don't strive,
LINE 549: You will die, you will die!
LINE 550: It is but of clay,
LINE 551: And in pieces will fly!
LINE 552: Mephistopheles.
LINE 553: What make you with the sieve?
LINE 554: The Father Cat-Ape. [_bringing down the sieve_]
LINE 555: When comes a thief,
LINE 556: On the instant we know him.
LINE 557: [_He runs off to the_ /Mother Cat-Ape/, _and lets her look through
LINE 558: the sieve._]
LINE 559: Look through the sieve!
LINE 560: See'st thou the thief,
LINE 561: And fearest to show him?
LINE 562: Mephistopheles. [_coming near the fire_]
LINE 563: And this pot?
LINE 564: Father Cat-Ape and his Wife.
LINE 565: The silly sot!
LINE 566: He knows not the pot!
LINE 567: And he knows not
LINE 568: The kettle, the sot!
LINE 569: Mephistopheles.
LINE 570: You ill-bred urchin, you!
LINE 571: The Father Cat-Ape.
LINE 572: Come, sit thee down,
LINE 573: We'll give thee a crown,
LINE 574: And a sceptre too!
LINE 575: [_He obliges_ /Mephistopheles/ _to sit down, and gives him a long
LINE 576: brush for a sceptre._
LINE 577: Faust. [_Who, while_ /Mephistopheles/ _was engaged with the
LINE 578: animals,_ /Faust/ _had been standing before a mirror,
LINE 579: alternately approaching it and retiring from it._]
LINE 580: What see I here? what heavenly image bright,
LINE 581: Within this magic mirror, chains my sight?
LINE 582: O Love, the swiftest of thy pinions lend me,
LINE 583: That where she is in rapture I may bend me!
LINE 584: Alas! when I would move one step more near,
LINE 585: To breathe her balmy atmosphere,
LINE 586: She seems to melt and disappear,
LINE 587: And cheats my longing eye.
LINE 588: Oh she is fair beyond all type of human!
LINE 589: Is't possible; can this be simple woman?
LINE 590: There lies she, on that downy couch reposing,
LINE 591: Within herself the heaven of heavens enclosing!
LINE 592: Can it then be that earth a thing so fair contains?
LINE 593: Mephistopheles.
LINE 594: Of course: for when a god has vexed his brains
LINE 595: For six long days, and, when his work is done,
LINE 596: Says bravo to himself, is it a wonder
LINE 597: He should make one fair thing without a blunder?
LINE 598: For this time give thine eyes their pleasure;
LINE 599: I know how to procure you such an one,
LINE 600: Whence thou mayst drink delight in brimming measure,
LINE 601: And blest the man, for whom Fate shall decide,
LINE 602: To lead home such a treasure as his bride!
LINE 603: [/Faust/ _continues gazing on the mirror._ /Mephistopheles/
LINE 604: _stretches himself on the arm-chair, and, playing with
LINE 605: the brush, goes on as follows:_]
LINE 606: Here, from my throne, a monarch, I look down:
LINE 607: My sceptre this: I wait to get my crown.
LINE 608: The Animals. [_Who had in the interval been wheeling about with
LINE 609: strange antic gestures, bring a crown to_ /Mephistopheles/,
LINE 610: _with loud shouts._]
LINE 611: O be but so good,
LINE 612: With sweat and with blood,
LINE 613: Your crown to glue,
LINE 614: As monarchs do!
LINE 615: [_They use the crown rather roughly, in consequence of which
LINE 616: it falls into two pieces, with which they jump about._]
LINE 617: O sorrow and shame!
LINE 618: 'Tis broken, no doubt:
LINE 619: But we'll make a name,
LINE 620: When our poem comes out!
LINE 621: Faust. [_gazing on the mirror_]
LINE 622: Woe's me! her beauty doth my wits confound.
LINE 623: Mephistopheles. [_pointing to the Brutes_]
LINE 624: And even my good brain is whirling round and round.
LINE 625: The Brutes.
LINE 626: And if we well speed,
LINE 627: As speed well we ought,
LINE 628: We are makers indeed,
LINE 629: We are moulders of thought.
LINE 630: Faust. [_as above_]
LINE 631: I burn, I burn! this rapturous glow
LINE 632: Consumes me sheer!--come, let us go!
LINE 633: Mephistopheles. [_as above_]
LINE 634: One must, at least, confess that they
LINE 635: Are honest poets in their way.
LINE 636: [_The kettle, which had been neglected by the Mother_ /Cat-Ape/
LINE 637: _begins to boil over: A great flame arises, and runs up the chimney.
LINE 638: The Witch comes through the flame, down the chimney, with a terrible
LINE 639: noise._
LINE 640: The Witch.
LINE 641: Ow! ow! ow! ow!
LINE 642: Thou damnèd brute! thou cursèd sow!
LINE 643: To leave the kettle and singe the frow!
LINE 644: Thou cursed imp, thou!
LINE 645: [_Turning to_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.]
LINE 646: What's this here now?
LINE 647: Who are you? who are you?
LINE 648: What's here ado?
LINE 649: Ye are scouts! ye are scouts!
LINE 650: Out with the louts!
LINE 651: A fiery arrow
LINE 652: Consume your marrow!
LINE 653: [_She plunges the ladle into the kettle, and spurts out flame on_
LINE 654: /Faust, Mephistopheles/, _and the Brutes. These last whine._
LINE 655: Mephistopheles. [_Who, in the meantime, had turned round the
LINE 656: butt-end of the brush, now dashes in amongst the pots and glasses._]
LINE 657: In two! in two!
LINE 658: There lies the broth!
LINE 659: The glass and the kettle,
LINE 660: Shiver them both!
LINE 661: 'Tis a jest, thou must know,
LINE 662: Thou carrion crow!
LINE 663: 'Tis a tune to keep time,
LINE 664: To thy senseless rhyme.
LINE 665: [_While the Witch, foaming with rage and fury, draws back._]
LINE 666: What! know'st me not? thou scrag! thou Jezebel!
LINE 667: Thy lord and master? thou should'st know me well.
LINE 668: What hinders me, in all my strength to come
LINE 669: And crush you and your cat-imps 'neath my thumb?
LINE 670: Know'st not the scarlet-doublet, mole-eyed mother?
LINE 671: Bow'st not the knee before the famed cock's feather?
LINE 672: Use your old eyes; behind a mask
LINE 673: Did I conceal my honest face?
LINE 674: And when I come here must I ask
LINE 675: A special introduction to your Grace?
LINE 676: The Witch.
LINE 677: O my liege lord! forgive the rough salute!
LINE 678: I did not see the horse's foot:
LINE 679: And where too have you left your pair of ravens?
LINE 680: Mephistopheles.
LINE 681: For this time you may thank the heavens
LINE 682: That you have made so cheap an escape;
LINE 683: 'Tis some time since I saw your face,
LINE 684: And things since then have moved apace.
LINE 685: The march of modern cultivation,
LINE 686: That licks the whole world into shape,
LINE 687: Has reached the Devil. In this wise generation
LINE 688: The Northern phantom is no longer seen,
LINE 689: And horns and tail and claws have been.
LINE 690: And for my hoof, with which I can't dispense,
LINE 691: In good society 'twould give great offence;
LINE 692: Therefore, like many a smart sprig of nobility,
LINE 693: I use false calves to trick out my gentility.
LINE 694: The Witch. [_dancing_]
LINE 695: Heyday! it almost turns my brain
LINE 696: To see Squire Satan here again!
LINE 697: Mephistopheles.
LINE 698: Woman, you must not call me by that name!
LINE 699: The Witch.
LINE 700: And wherefore not? I see no cause for shame.
LINE 701: Mephistopheles.
LINE 702: That name has had its station long assigned
LINE 703: With Mother Bunch; and yet I cannot see
LINE 704: Men are much better for the want of me.
LINE 705: The wicked one is gone, the wicked stay behind.
LINE 706: Call me now Baron, less than that were rude--
LINE 707: I am a cavalier like other cavaliers;
LINE 708: My line is noble, and my blood is good;
LINE 709: Here is a coat of arms that all the world reveres.
LINE 710: [_He makes an indecent gesture._
LINE 711: The Witch. [_laughing immoderately_]
LINE 712: Ha! ha! now I perceive Old Nick is here!
LINE 713: You are a rogue still, as you always were.
LINE 714: Mephistopheles. [_aside to_ /Faust/]
LINE 715: My friend, I give you here, your wit to whet,
LINE 716: A little lesson in witch-etiquette.
LINE 717: The Witch.
LINE 718: Now say, good sirs, what would you have with me?
LINE 719: Mephistopheles.
LINE 720: A glass of your restoring liquor,
LINE 721: That makes an old man's blood run quicker:
LINE 722: And bring the best out from your bins;
LINE 723: With years the juice in virtue wins.
LINE 724: The Witch.
LINE 725: Most willingly. Here I have got a phial
LINE 726: Of which myself at times make trial:
LINE 727: 'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion;
LINE 728: You shall not meet with a denial.
LINE 729: [_Softly._] Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution,
LINE 730: His life can't stand an hour against its strong infection.
LINE 731: Mephistopheles.
LINE 732: Leave that to me; he's under my protection,
LINE 733: Ripe for the draught; no harm will come to him.
LINE 734: [_The_ /Witch/, _with strange gestures, draws a circle and places
LINE 735: many curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle,
LINE 736: and the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts
LINE 737: the_ /Cat-Apes/ _into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to
LINE 738: lay the book on, and hold the torches. She motions to_ /Faust/ _to
LINE 739: come near._
LINE 740: Faust. [_to_ /Mephistopheles/]
LINE 741: Now say, what would she with this flummery?
LINE 742: These antic gestures, this wild bedlam-stuff,
LINE 743: This most insipid of all mummery,
LINE 744: I know it well, I hate it well enough.
LINE 745: Mephistopheles.
LINE 746: Pshaw, nonsense! come, give up your sermonizing,
LINE 747: And learn to understand what a good joke is!
LINE 748: Like other quacks, she plays her hocus-pocus;
LINE 749: It gives the juice a virtue most surprising!
LINE 750: [_He obliges_ /Faust/ _to enter the circle._
LINE 751: The Witch. [_declaiming from the book with great emphasis_]
LINE 752: Now be exact!
LINE 753: Of one make ten,
LINE 754: Then two subtract,
LINE 755: And add three then,
LINE 756: This makes thee rich.
LINE 757: Four shalt thou bate,
LINE 758: Of five and six,
LINE 759: So says the Witch,
LINE 760: Make seven and eight,
LINE 761: And all is done.
LINE 762: And nine is one,
LINE 763: And ten is none;
LINE 764: Here take and spell, if you are able,
LINE 765: The Witches' multiplication table.
LINE 766: Faust.
LINE 767: This is a jargon worse than Babel;
LINE 768: Say, is she fevered? is she mad?
LINE 769: Mephistopheles.
LINE 770: O never fear! the rest is quite as bad;
LINE 771: I know the book, and oft have vexed my brains
LINE 772: With bootless labor on its rhymes and rules;
LINE 773: A downright contradiction still remains,
LINE 774: Mysterious alike for wise men and for fools.
LINE 775: My friend, the art is old and new;
LINE 776: Ancient and modern schools agree
LINE 777: With three and one, and one and three
LINE 778: Plain to perplex, and false inweave with true.
LINE 779: So they expound, discourse, dispute, debate;
LINE 780: What man of sense would plague him with their prate?
LINE 781: Men pin their faith to words, in sounds high sapience weening,
LINE 782: Though words were surely made to have a meaning.
LINE 783: The Witch. [_Goes on reading from the book_]
LINE 784: The soul to know
LINE 785: Beneath the show,
LINE 786: And view it without blinking;
LINE 787: The simple mind
LINE 788: The craft will find,
LINE 789: Without the toil of thinking.
LINE 790: Faust.
LINE 791: What flood of nonsense now she's pouring o'er us?
LINE 792: She'll split my skull with her insensate chatter.
LINE 793: I feel as if I heard the ceaseless clatter
LINE 794: Of thirty thousand idiots in a chorus.
LINE 795: Mephistopheles.
LINE 796: Enough, kind Sibyl; thanks for thy good will!
LINE 797: Now bring your jug here, and the goblet fill
LINE 798: With this prime juice, till it be brimming o'er.
LINE 799: My friend here is a man of high degrees,
LINE 800: And will digest the draught with ease.
LINE 801: He has swilled many a goodly glass before.
LINE 802: [_The_ /Witch/, _with many ceremonies, pours the beverage into
LINE 803: a cup. While_ /Faust/ _brings it to his mouth a light flame arises._
LINE 804: Mephistopheles.
LINE 805: Come, quaff it boldly, without thinking!
LINE 806: The draught will make thy heart to burn with love.
LINE 807: Art with the Devil hand and glove,
LINE 808: And from a fire-spurt would'st be shrinking?
LINE 809: [_The_ /Witch/ _looses the circle._ /Faust/ _steps out._
LINE 810: Mephistopheles.
LINE 811: Come quickly out; you must not rest.
LINE 812: The Witch.
LINE 813: I hope the swig will wonders work on thee!
LINE 814: Mephistopheles.
LINE 815: And you, if you have aught to beg of me,
LINE 816: Upon Walpurgis' night make your request.
LINE 817: The Witch.
LINE 818: Here is a song! at times sung, you will find
LINE 819: It hath a wondrous working on your mind.
LINE 820: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 821: Come, yield thee now to my desire;
LINE 822: Be meek for once, and own the bridle.
LINE 823: You must keep quiet, and let yourself perspire,
LINE 824: That through your inmost frame the potent juice may pierce.
LINE 825: When we have time to spare, I will rehearse
LINE 826: Some lessons on the art of being nobly idle;
LINE 827: And soon thy heart with ecstasy shall know,
LINE 828: How Cupid 'gins to stir, and boundeth to and fro.
LINE 829: Faust. [_Turning again towards the mirror_]
LINE 830: Indulge me with one glance!--one moment spare!
LINE 831: It was a virgin-form surpassing fair!
LINE 832: Mephistopheles.
LINE 833: No! No! with my good aid thou soon shalt see
LINE 834: The paragon of women bodily.
LINE 835: [_Aside._] Anon, if this good potion does its duty,
LINE 836: He'll see in every wench the Trojan beauty.
LINE 837: Scene IV.
LINE 838: _A Street._
LINE 839: /Faust. Margaret/ _passes over._
LINE 840: Faust.
LINE 841: My fair young lady, may I dare
LINE 842: To offer you my escort home?
LINE 843: Margaret.
LINE 844: Nor lady I, good sir, nor fair,
LINE 845: And need no guide to show me home. [_Exit._
LINE 846: Faust.
LINE 847: By heaven, this child is passing fair!
LINE 848: A fairer never crossed my view;
LINE 849: Of such a modest gentle air,
LINE 850: Yet with a dash of pertness too,
LINE 851: And girlish innocent conceit;
LINE 852: Her lips so red, her cheeks so bright,
LINE 853: Forget I could not, if I might.
LINE 854: How she casts down her lovely eyes
LINE 855: Deep graven in my heart it lies,
LINE 856: And how so smartly she replied,
LINE 857: And with a sharp turn stepped aside,
LINE 858: It was most ravishingly sweet!
LINE 859: _Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 860: Faust.
LINE 861: Hark! you must get the girl for me!
LINE 862: Mephistopheles.
LINE 863: Which one?
LINE 864: Faust.
LINE 865: She's just gone by.
LINE 866: Mephistopheles.
LINE 867: What! she?
LINE 868: She's only now come from confession,
LINE 869: Where she received a full remission.
LINE 870: I slinked close by the box, and heard
LINE 871: The simple damsel's every word;
LINE 872: 'Tis a most guileless thing, that goes
LINE 873: For very nothing to the priest.
LINE 874: My power does not extend to those.
LINE 875: Faust.
LINE 876: Yet she is fourteen years of age at least.
LINE 877: Mephistopheles.
LINE 878: You speak like Jack the debauchee,
LINE 879: Who thinks each sweet flow'r grows for me;
LINE 880: As if his wish sufficed alone
LINE 881: To make each priceless pearl his own:
LINE 882: But 'tis not so; and cannot be.
LINE 883: Faust.
LINE 884: My good Sir Knight of pedantry,
LINE 885: Lay not thou down the law to me!
LINE 886: And this, for good and all, be told,
LINE 887: Unless, this very night, I hold
LINE 888: The sweet young maid in my embrace,
LINE 889: 'Tis the last time that you shall see my face.
LINE 890: Mephistopheles.
LINE 891: Bethink thee!--what with here, and what with there,
LINE 892: The thing requires no little care.
LINE 893: Full fourteen days must first be spent,
LINE 894: To come upon the proper scent.
LINE 895: Faust.
LINE 896: Had I but seven good hours of rest,
LINE 897: The devil's aid I'd ne'er request,
LINE 898: To mould this fair young creature to my bent.
LINE 899: Mephistopheles.
LINE 900: You speak as if you were a Frenchman born;
LINE 901: But though the end be good, we must not scorn
LINE 902: The means; what boots the mere gratification?
LINE 903: It is the best half of the recreation,
LINE 904: When, up and down, and to and fro,
LINE 905: The pretty doll, through every kind
LINE 906: Of fiddle-faddle sweet flirtation,
LINE 907: You knead out first, and dress up to your mind--
LINE 908: As many an Italian tale can show.
LINE 909: Faust.
LINE 910: I need no tricks to whet my zest.
LINE 911: Mephistopheles.
LINE 912: I tell thee plainly without jest,
LINE 913: As things stand here, we cannot win
LINE 914: The fort by hotly rushing in;
LINE 915: To gain fair lady's favor, you
LINE 916: Must boldly scheme, and gently do.
LINE 917: Faust.
LINE 918: Fetch me something that breathed her air!
LINE 919: Her home, her chamber, plant me there!
LINE 920: A kerchief of her chaste attire!
LINE 921: A garter of my heart's desire!
LINE 922: Mephistopheles.
LINE 923: That you may see how I would fain
LINE 924: Do all I can to ease your pain,
LINE 925: We shall not lose a single minute;
LINE 926: I know her room--thou shalt enjoy thee in it.
LINE 927: Faust.
LINE 928: And I shall see her?--have her?
LINE 929: Mephistopheles.
LINE 930: No!
LINE 931: She'll be with a neighbor--better so.
LINE 932: Meanwhile, unhindered thou may'st go,
LINE 933: And on the hope of joys that wait thee,
LINE 934: Within her atmosphere may'st sate thee.
LINE 935: Faust.
LINE 936: Can we go now?
LINE 937: Mephistopheles.
LINE 938: No; we must wait till night.
LINE 939: Faust.
LINE 940: Go fetch a present for my heart's delight. [_Exit._
LINE 941: Mephistopheles.
LINE 942: Presents already! good!--a lover should not loiter!
LINE 943: I know some dainty spots of ground,
LINE 944: Where hidden treasures can be found;
LINE 945: I will go straight and reconnoitre. [_Exit._
LINE 946: Scene V.
LINE 947: _A small neat Chamber._
LINE 948: Margaret. [_Plaiting and putting up her hair._]
LINE 949: I wonder who the gentleman could be,
LINE 950: That on the street accosted me to-day!
LINE 951: He looked a gallant cavalier and gay,
LINE 952: And must be of a noble family;
LINE 953: That I could read upon his brow--
LINE 954: Else had he never been so free. [_Exit._
LINE 955: _Enter_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 956: Mephistopheles.
LINE 957: Come in--but softly--we are landed now!
LINE 958: Faust. [_after a pause_]
LINE 959: Leave me alone a minute, I entreat!
LINE 960: Mephistopheles. [_looking round about_]
LINE 961: Not every maiden keeps her room so neat. [_Exit._
LINE 962: Faust. [_looking round_]
LINE 963: Be greeted, thou sweet twilight-shine!
LINE 964: Through this chaste sanctuary shed!
LINE 965: Oh seize my heart, sweet pains of love divine,
LINE 966: That on the languid dew of hope are fed!
LINE 967: What sacred stillness holds the air!
LINE 968: What order, what contentment rare!
LINE 969: [_He throws himself on the old leathern arm-chair beside the bed._]
LINE 970: Receive thou me! thou, who, in ages gone,
LINE 971: In joy and grief hast welcomed sire and son.
LINE 972: How often round this old paternal throne,
LINE 973: A clambering host of playful children hung!
LINE 974: Belike that here my loved one too hath clung
LINE 975: To her hoar grandsire's neck, with childish joy
LINE 976: Thankful received the yearly Christmas toy,
LINE 977: And with the full red cheeks of childhood pressed
LINE 978: Upon his withered hand a pious kiss.
LINE 979: I feel, sweet maid, mine inmost soul possessed
LINE 980: By thy calm spirit of order and of bliss,
LINE 981: That motherly doth teach thee day by day:
LINE 982: That bids thee deck the table clean and neat,
LINE 983: And crisps the very sand strewn at thy feet.
LINE 984: Sweet hand! sweet, lovely hand! where thou dost sway,
LINE 985: The meanest hut is decked in heaven's array.
LINE 986: And here! [_He lifts up the bed-curtain._]
LINE 987: O Heaven, what strange o'ermastering might
LINE 988: Thrills every sense with fine delight!
LINE 989: Here might I gaze unwearied day and night.
LINE 990: Nature! in airy dreams here didst thou build
LINE 991: The mortal hull of the angelic child;
LINE 992: Here she reposed! her tender bosom teeming
LINE 993: With warmest life, in buoyant fulness streaming,
LINE 994: And here, with pulse of gently gracious power,
LINE 995: The heaven-born bud was nursed into a flower!
LINE 996: And thou! what brought thee here? why now backshrinks
LINE 997: Thy courage from the prize it sought before?
LINE 998: What wouldst thou have? Thy heart within thee sinks;
LINE 999: Poor wretched Faust! thou know'st thyself no more.
LINE 1000: Do I then breathe a magic atmosphere?
LINE 1001: I sought immediate enjoyment here,
LINE 1002: And into viewless dreams my passion flows!
LINE 1003: Are we the sport of every breath that blows?
LINE 1004: If now she came, and found me gazing here,
LINE 1005: How for this boldfaced presence must I pay!
LINE 1006: The mighty man, how small would he appear,
LINE 1007: And at her feet, a suppliant, sink away!
LINE 1008: Mephistopheles. [_coming back_]
LINE 1009: Quick! quick! I see her--she'll be here anon.
LINE 1010: Faust.
LINE 1011: Yes, let's be gone! for once and all be gone!
LINE 1012: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1013: Here is a casket, of a goodly weight;
LINE 1014: Its former lord, I ween, bewails its fate.
LINE 1015: Come, put it in the press. I swear
LINE 1016: She'll lose her senses when she sees it there.
LINE 1017: The trinkets that I stowed within it
LINE 1018: Were bait meant for a nobler prey:
LINE 1019: But child is child, and play is play!
LINE 1020: Faust.
LINE 1021: I know not--shall I?
LINE 1022: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1023: Can you doubt a minute?
LINE 1024: Would you then keep the dainty pelf,
LINE 1025: Like an old miser, to yourself?
LINE 1026: If so, I would advise you, sir,
LINE 1027: To spare your squire the bitter toil,
LINE 1028: And with some choicer sport the hour beguile
LINE 1029: Than looking lustfully at her.
LINE 1030: I scratch my head and rub my hands that you--
LINE 1031: [_He puts the casket into the cupboard, and locks the door again._]
LINE 1032: Come, let's away!--
LINE 1033: With this sweet piece of womanhood may do,
LINE 1034: As will may sway;
LINE 1035: And you stand there,
LINE 1036: And gape and stare,
LINE 1037: As if you looked into a lecture-room,
LINE 1038: And there with awe
LINE 1039: The twin grey spectres bodily saw,
LINE 1040: Physics and Metaphysics! Come!
LINE 1041: [_Exeunt._
LINE 1042: _Enter_ /Margaret/, _with a lamp._
LINE 1043: Margaret.
LINE 1044: It is so sultry here, so hot! [_She opens the window._]
LINE 1045: And yet so warm without 'tis not.
LINE 1046: I feel--I know not how--oppressed;
LINE 1047: Would to God that my mother came!
LINE 1048: A shivering cold runs o'er my frame--
LINE 1049: I'm but a silly timid girl at best!
LINE 1050: [_While taking off her clothes, she sings._]
LINE 1051: There was a king in Thule,
LINE 1052: True-hearted to his grave:
LINE 1053: To him his dying lady
LINE 1054: A golden goblet gave.
LINE 1055: He prized it more than rubies;
LINE 1056: At every drinking-bout
LINE 1057: His eyes they swam in glory,
LINE 1058: When he would drain it out.
LINE 1059: On his death-bed he counted
LINE 1060: His cities one by one;
LINE 1061: Unto his heirs he left them;
LINE 1062: The bowl he gave to none.
LINE 1063: He sat amid his barons,
LINE 1064: And feasted merrily,
LINE 1065: Within his father's castle,
LINE 1066: That beetles o'er the sea.
LINE 1067: There stood the old carouser,
LINE 1068: And drank his life's last glow;
LINE 1069: Then flung the goblet over
LINE 1070: Into the sea below.
LINE 1071: He saw it fall, and gurgling
LINE 1072: Sink deep into the sea;
LINE 1073: His eyes they sank in darkness;
LINE 1074: No bumper more drank he.
LINE 1075: [_She opens the cupboard to put in her clothes, and sees the
LINE 1076: casket._]
LINE 1077: How came the pretty casket here? no doubt
LINE 1078: I locked the press when I went out.
LINE 1079: 'Tis really strange!--Belike that it was sent
LINE 1080: A pledge for money that my mother lent.
LINE 1081: Here hangs the key; sure there can be no sin
LINE 1082: In only looking what may be within.
LINE 1083: What have we here? good heavens! see!
LINE 1084: What a display of finery!
LINE 1085: Here is a dress in which a queen
LINE 1086: Might on a gala-day be seen.
LINE 1087: I wonder how the necklace would suit me!
LINE 1088: Who may the lord of all this splendor be?
LINE 1089: [_She puts on the necklace, and looks at herself in the glass._]
LINE 1090: Were but the ear-rings mine to wear!
LINE 1091: It gives one such a different air.
LINE 1092: What boots the beauty of the poor?
LINE 1093: 'Tis very beautiful to be sure,
LINE 1094: But without riches little weighs;
LINE 1095: They praise you, but half pity while they praise.
LINE 1096: Gold is the pole,
LINE 1097: To which all point: the whole
LINE 1098: Big world hangs on gold. Alas we poor!
LINE 1099: Scene VI.
LINE 1100: _A Walk._
LINE 1101: /Faust/ _going up and down thoughtfully; then enter_
LINE 1102: /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 1103: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1104: By all the keen pangs of love! by all the hot blasts of hell!
LINE 1105: By all the fellest of curses, if curse there be any more fell!
LINE 1106: Faust.
LINE 1107: How now, Mephisto? what the devil's wrong?
LINE 1108: I ne'er beheld a face one half so long!
LINE 1109: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1110: But that I am a devil myself, I'd sell
LINE 1111: Both soul and body on the spot to hell!
LINE 1112: Faust.
LINE 1113: I verily believe you've got a craze!
LINE 1114: Beseems it you with such outrageous phrase,
LINE 1115: To rage like any bedlamite?
LINE 1116: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1117: Only conceive! the box of rare gewgaws
LINE 1118: For Margaret got, is in a parson's claws!
LINE 1119: The thing came to the mother's sight,
LINE 1120: Who soon suspected all was not right:
LINE 1121: The woman has got a most delicate nose,
LINE 1122: That snuffling through the prayer-book goes,
LINE 1123: And seldom scents a thing in vain,
LINE 1124: If it be holy or profane.
LINE 1125: Your jewels, she was not long in guessing,
LINE 1126: Were not like to bring a blessing.
LINE 1127: "My child," quoth she, "ill-gotten gear
LINE 1128: Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood;
LINE 1129: We'll give it to Mary-mother dear,
LINE 1130: And she will feed us with heavenly food!"
LINE 1131: Margaret looked blank--"'tis hard," thought she,
LINE 1132: "To put a gift-horse away from me;
LINE 1133: And surely godless was he never
LINE 1134: Who lodged it here, a gracious giver."
LINE 1135: The mother then brought in the priest;
LINE 1136: He quickly understood the jest,
LINE 1137: And his eyes watered at the sight.
LINE 1138: "Good dame," quoth he, "you have done right!
LINE 1139: He conquers all the world who wins
LINE 1140: A victory o'er his darling sins.
LINE 1141: The Church is a most sharp-set lady,
LINE 1142: And her stomach holds good store,
LINE 1143: Has swallowed lands on lands already,
LINE 1144: And, still unglutted, craves for more;
LINE 1145: The Church alone, my ladies dear,
LINE 1146: Can digest ill-gotten gear."
LINE 1147: Faust.
LINE 1148: That is a general fashion--Jew,
LINE 1149: And King, and Kaiser have it too.
LINE 1150: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1151: Then ring and ear-ring, and necklace, and casket,
LINE 1152: Like a bundle of toad-stools away he bore;
LINE 1153: Thanked her no less, and thanked her no more,
LINE 1154: Than had it been so many nuts in a basket;
LINE 1155: On heavenly treasures then held an oration,
LINE 1156: Much, of course, to their edification.
LINE 1157: Faust.
LINE 1158: And Margaret?
LINE 1159: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1160: Sits now in restless mood,
LINE 1161: Knows neither what she would, nor what she should;
LINE 1162: Broods o'er the trinkets night and day,
LINE 1163: And on him who sent them, more.
LINE 1164: Faust.
LINE 1165: Sweet love! her grief doth vex me sore.
LINE 1166: Mephisto, mark well what I say!
LINE 1167: Get her another set straightway!
LINE 1168: The first were not so very fine.
LINE 1169: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1170: O yes! with you all things are mere child's play.
LINE 1171: Faust.
LINE 1172: Quick hence! and match your will with mine!
LINE 1173: Throw thee oft in her neighbor's way.
LINE 1174: Be not a devil of milk and water,
LINE 1175: And for another gift go cater.
LINE 1176: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1177: Yes, gracious sir! most humbly I obey.
LINE 1178: [_Exit_ /Faust/.
LINE 1179: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1180: Such love-sick fools as these would blow
LINE 1181: Sun, moon, and stars, like vilest stuff,
LINE 1182: To nothing with a single puff,
LINE 1183: To make their lady-love a show!
LINE 1184: Scene VII.
LINE 1185: /Martha's/ _House._
LINE 1186: Martha. [_alone_]
LINE 1187: In honest truth, it was not nobly done,
LINE 1188: In my good spouse to leave me here alone!
LINE 1189: May God forgive him! while he roams at large,
LINE 1190: O'er the wide world, I live at my own charge.
LINE 1191: Sure he could have no reason to complain!
LINE 1192: So good a wife he'll not find soon again. [_She weeps._]
LINE 1193: He may be dead!--Ah me!--could I but know,
LINE 1194: By a certificate, that 'tis really so!
LINE 1195: _Enter_ /Margaret/.
LINE 1196: Margaret.
LINE 1197: Martha!
LINE 1198: Martha.
LINE 1199: What wouldst thou, dear?
LINE 1200: Margaret.
LINE 1201: My knees can scarcely bear me!--only hear!
LINE 1202: I found a second box to-day
LINE 1203: Of ebon-wood, just where the first one lay,
LINE 1204: Brimful of jewels passing rare,
LINE 1205: Much finer than the others.
LINE 1206: Martha.
LINE 1207: Have a care
LINE 1208: You keep this well masked from your mother--
LINE 1209: 'Twould fare no better than the other.
LINE 1210: Margaret.
LINE 1211: Only come near, and see! look here!
LINE 1212: Martha. [_decking her with the jewels_]
LINE 1213: Thou art a lucky little dear!
LINE 1214: Margaret.
LINE 1215: And yet I dare not thus be seen
LINE 1216: In church, or on the public green.
LINE 1217: Martha.
LINE 1218: Just come across when you've an hour to spare,
LINE 1219: And put the gauds on here with none to see!
LINE 1220: Then promenade awhile before the mirror there;
LINE 1221: 'Twill be a joy alike to thee and me.
LINE 1222: Then on a Sunday, or a holiday,
LINE 1223: Our riches by degrees we can display.
LINE 1224: A necklace first, the drops then in your ear;
LINE 1225: Your mother sees it not; and should she hear,
LINE 1226: 'Tis easy to invent some fair pretence or other.
LINE 1227: Margaret.
LINE 1228: But whence the pretty caskets came? I fear
LINE 1229: There's something in it not right altogether. [_Knocking._]
LINE 1230: Good God!--I hear a step--is it my mother?
LINE 1231: Martha. [_looking through the casement_]
LINE 1232: 'Tis a strange gentleman. Come in!
LINE 1233: _Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 1234: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1235: I hope the ladies will not think me rude,
LINE 1236: That uninvited thus I here intrude.
LINE 1237: [_Observing_ /Margaret/, _he draws back respectfully._]
LINE 1238: I have commands for Mistress Martha Schwerdtlein.
LINE 1239: Martha.
LINE 1240: For me? what has the gentleman to say?
LINE 1241: Mephistopheles. [_softly to her_]
LINE 1242: Excuse my freedom. I perceive that you
LINE 1243: Have visitors of rank to-day;
LINE 1244: For this time I shall bid adieu,
LINE 1245: And after dinner do myself the pleasure
LINE 1246: To wait upon you, when you're more at leisure.
LINE 1247: Martha. [_aloud_]
LINE 1248: Think, child! of all things in the world the last!
LINE 1249: My Gretchen for a lady should have passed!
LINE 1250: Margaret.
LINE 1251: The gentleman is far too good;
LINE 1252: I'm a poor girl--boast neither wealth nor blood.
LINE 1253: This dress, these jewels, are not mine.
LINE 1254: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1255: 'Tis not the dress alone that I admire;
LINE 1256: She has a mien, a gait, a look so fine,
LINE 1257: That speak the lady more than costliest attire.
LINE 1258: Martha.
LINE 1259: And now your business, sir? I much desire--
LINE 1260: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1261: Would God I had a better tale to tell!
LINE 1262: Small thanks I should receive, I knew it well.
LINE 1263: Your husband's dead--his last fond words I bear.
LINE 1264: Martha.
LINE 1265: Is dead! the good fond soul! O woe!
LINE 1266: My man is dead! flow, sorrow, flow!
LINE 1267: Margaret.
LINE 1268: Beseech thee, dearest Martha, don't despair.
LINE 1269: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1270: Now hear my mournful story to the end.
LINE 1271: Margaret.
LINE 1272: I would not love a man on earth, to rend
LINE 1273: Me thus with grief, when he might hap to die.
LINE 1274: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1275: Joy hath its sorrow, sorrow hath its joy;
LINE 1276: Twin sisters are they, as the proverb saith.
LINE 1277: Martha.
LINE 1278: Now let me hear the manner of his death.
LINE 1279: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1280: Where Padua's sacred turrets rise,
LINE 1281: Above the grave of holy Antony,
LINE 1282: On consecrated ground thy husband lies,
LINE 1283: And slumbers for eternity.
LINE 1284: Martha.
LINE 1285: No further message? is this all?
LINE 1286: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1287: Yes! one request, and that not small.
LINE 1288: For his soul's peace, your good man wanted
LINE 1289: Three hundred masses to be chanted.
LINE 1290: This is the whole of my commission.
LINE 1291: Martha.
LINE 1292: What! not a jewel? not a coin?
LINE 1293: No journeyman, however poor,
LINE 1294: However wild, could make such an omission,
LINE 1295: But in the bottom of his pouch is sure
LINE 1296: To keep some small memorial for his wife,
LINE 1297: And rather beg, and rather pine
LINE 1298: Away the remnant of his life--
LINE 1299: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1300: Madam! for your hard case I greatly grieve,
LINE 1301: But your good husband had no gold to leave.
LINE 1302: His sins and follies he lamented sore--
LINE 1303: Yes! and bewailed his own mishap much more.
LINE 1304: Margaret.
LINE 1305: Alas for all the miseries of mankind!
LINE 1306: He shall not want my oft-repeated prayer.
LINE 1307: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Margaret/]
LINE 1308: Thou, gentle heart, dost well deserve to find
LINE 1309: A husband worthy of a bride so fair.
LINE 1310: Margaret.
LINE 1311: Ah no!--for that, it is too soon.
LINE 1312: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1313: A lover, then, might in the meantime do.
LINE 1314: 'Tis bounteous Heaven's choicest boon
LINE 1315: To fondle in one's arms so sweet a thing as you.
LINE 1316: Margaret.
LINE 1317: Such things are never done with us.
LINE 1318: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1319: Done or not done!--it may be managed thus:--
LINE 1320: Martha.
LINE 1321: Now let me hear!
LINE 1322: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1323: By his death-bed I stood.
LINE 1324: It was a little better than of dung,
LINE 1325: Of mouldy straw; there, as a Christian should,
LINE 1326: With many a sin repented on his tongue,
LINE 1327: He died.--"Oh! how must I," he said,
LINE 1328: "Myself detest so to throw up my trade,
LINE 1329: And my dear wife abandon so!
LINE 1330: It kills me with the simple memory, oh!
LINE 1331: Might she but now forgive me, ere I die!"
LINE 1332: Martha. [_weeping_]
LINE 1333: Good soul! I have forgiven him long ago.
LINE 1334: Mephistopheles. [_continuing his interrupted narrative_]
LINE 1335: And yet was she, God knows, much more to blame than I.
LINE 1336: Martha.
LINE 1337: What! did he lie? on the grave's brink to lie!
LINE 1338: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1339: He fabled to the last, be sure,
LINE 1340: If I am half a connoisseur.
LINE 1341: "In sooth, I had no time to gape," he said,
LINE 1342: "First to get children, then to get them bread,
LINE 1343: To clothe them, and to put them to a trade,
LINE 1344: From toil and labor I had no release,
LINE 1345: And could not even eat my own thin slice in peace."
LINE 1346: Martha.
LINE 1347: Can it then be? has he forgotten quite
LINE 1348: My fag and drudgery, by day and night?
LINE 1349: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1350: Not quite! attend the sequel of my tale.
LINE 1351: "When last we sailed from Malta"--so he said,
LINE 1352: "For wife and children fervently I prayed,
LINE 1353: And Heaven then blew a favorable gale.
LINE 1354: We came across a Turkish ship that bore
LINE 1355: Home bullion to increase the Sultan's store,
LINE 1356: And soon, by valor's right, were masters
LINE 1357: Of all the Infidel piastres;
LINE 1358: The precious spoil was shared among the crew,
LINE 1359: And I received the part that was my due."
LINE 1360: Martha.
LINE 1361: But where and how?--has he then buried it?
LINE 1362: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1363: Who knows where the four winds have hurried it!
LINE 1364: A lady took him under her protection
LINE 1365: At Naples, as he wandered to and fro;
LINE 1366: She left him many a mark of her affection,
LINE 1367: As to his life's end he had cause to know.
LINE 1368: Martha.
LINE 1369: The knave, to treat his helpless orphans so!
LINE 1370: To all our misery and all our need,
LINE 1371: Amid his reckless life, he gave no heed!
LINE 1372: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1373: And for that cause he's dead. If I were you,
LINE 1374: Now mark me well, I tell you what I'd do;
LINE 1375: I'd mourn him decently for one chaste year,
LINE 1376: Then look about me for another dear.
LINE 1377: Martha.
LINE 1378: Alas! God knows it would be hard to find
LINE 1379: Another so completely to my mind.
LINE 1380: A better-hearted fool you never knew,
LINE 1381: A love of roving was his only vice;
LINE 1382: And foreign wine, and foreign women too,
LINE 1383: And the accursèd gambling dice.
LINE 1384: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1385: Such marriage-articles were most convenient,
LINE 1386: Had he to you been only half so lenient.
LINE 1387: On terms like these myself had no objection
LINE 1388: To change with you the ring of conjugal affection.
LINE 1389: Martha.
LINE 1390: You jest, mein Herr!
LINE 1391: Mephistopheles. [_aside_]
LINE 1392: A serious jest for me!
LINE 1393: I'd better go; for, if I tarry here,
LINE 1394: She'll take the devil at his word, I fear.
LINE 1395: [_To_ /Margaret/.] How stands it with your heart then?--is it free?
LINE 1396: Margaret.
LINE 1397: I scarce know what you mean.
LINE 1398: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1399: Sweet guileless heart!
LINE 1400: Ladies, farewell!
LINE 1401: Margaret.
LINE 1402: Farewell!
LINE 1403: Martha.
LINE 1404: One word before we part!
LINE 1405: I fain would have it solemnly averred,
LINE 1406: How my dear husband died, and where he was interred.
LINE 1407: Order was aye my special virtue; and
LINE 1408: 'Tis right both where and when he died should stand
LINE 1409: In the newspapers.
LINE 1410: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1411: Yes, when two attest,
LINE 1412: As Scripture saith, the truth is manifest.
LINE 1413: I have a friend, who, at your requisition,
LINE 1414: Before the judge will make a deposition.
LINE 1415: I'll bring him here.
LINE 1416: Martha.
LINE 1417: Yes, bring him with you, do!
LINE 1418: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1419: And we shall meet your fair young lady too?
LINE 1420: [_To_ /Margaret/.] A gallant youth!--has been abroad, and seen
LINE 1421: The world--a perfect cavalier, I trow.
LINE 1422: Margaret.
LINE 1423: 'Twould make me blush, should he bestow
LINE 1424: A single look on one so mean.
LINE 1425: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1426: You have no cause to be ashamed before
LINE 1427: The proudest king that ever sceptre bore.
LINE 1428: Martha.
LINE 1429: This evening, in the garden then, behind
LINE 1430: The house, you'll find warm hearts and welcome kind!
LINE 1431: Scene VIII.
LINE 1432: _A Street._
LINE 1433: Faust.
LINE 1434: How now? what news? how speed your labors?
LINE 1435: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1436: Bravo! 'tis well you are on fire;
LINE 1437: Soon shall you have your heart's desire.
LINE 1438: This evening you shall meet her at her neighbor's;
LINE 1439: A dame 'tis to a nicety made
LINE 1440: For the bawd and gipsy trade.
LINE 1441: Faust.
LINE 1442: 'Tis well.
LINE 1443: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1444: But you must lend a hand, and so must I.
LINE 1445: Faust.
LINE 1446: One good turn deserves another.
LINE 1447: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1448: We must appear before a judge together,
LINE 1449: And solemnly there testify
LINE 1450: That stiff and stark her worthy spouse doth lie,
LINE 1451: Beside the shrine of holy Antony.
LINE 1452: Faust.
LINE 1453: Most wise! we must first make a goodly travel!
LINE 1454: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1455: _Sancta simplicitas!_ what stuff you drivel!
LINE 1456: We may make oath, and not know much about it.
LINE 1457: Faust.
LINE 1458: If that's your best, your best is bad. I scout it.
LINE 1459: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1460: O holy man that would outwit the devil!
LINE 1461: Is it the first time in your life that you
LINE 1462: Have sworn to what you knew could not be true?
LINE 1463: Of God, the world, and all that it contains,
LINE 1464: Of man, and all that circles in his veins,
LINE 1465: Or dwells within the compass of his brains,
LINE 1466: Have you not pompous definitions given,
LINE 1467: With swelling breast and dogmatizing brow,
LINE 1468: As if you were an oracle from heaven?
LINE 1469: And yet, if the plain truth you will avow,
LINE 1470: You knew as much of all these things, in faith,
LINE 1471: As now you know of Master Schwerdtlein's death!
LINE 1472: Faust.
LINE 1473: Thou art, and wert, a sophist and a liar.
LINE 1474: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1475: Yes, unless one could mount a little higher.
LINE 1476: To-morrow I shall hear you pour
LINE 1477: False vows that silly girl before,
LINE 1478: Swear to do everything to serve her,
LINE 1479: And love her with a quenchless fervor.
LINE 1480: Faust.
LINE 1481: And from my heart too.
LINE 1482: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1483: Oh! of course, of course!
LINE 1484: Then will you speak, till you are hoarse,
LINE 1485: Of love, and constancy, and truth,
LINE 1486: And feelings of eternal youth--
LINE 1487: Will that too be the simple sooth?
LINE 1488: Faust.
LINE 1489: It will! it will!--for, when I feel,
LINE 1490: And for the feeling, the confusion
LINE 1491: Of feelings, that absorbs my mind,
LINE 1492: Seek for names, and none can find,
LINE 1493: Sweep through the universe's girth
LINE 1494: For every highest word to give it birth;
LINE 1495: And then this soul-pervading flame,
LINE 1496: Infinite, endless, endless name,
LINE 1497: Call you this nought but devilish delusion?
LINE 1498: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1499: Still I am right!
LINE 1500: Faust.
LINE 1501: Hold! mark me, you
LINE 1502: Are right indeed! for this is true,
LINE 1503: Who _will_ be right, and only has a tongue,
LINE 1504: Is never wrong.
LINE 1505: Come, I confess thee master in debating,
LINE 1506: That I may be delivered from thy prating.
LINE 1507: /end of act third/.
