LINE 1: Scene I.
LINE 2: _Walpurgis-Night._
LINE 3: _The Hartz Mountains. Neighborhood of Schirke and Elend._
LINE 4: /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 5: Mephistopheles.
LINE 6: Would you not like a broomstick to bestride?
LINE 7: Would God I had a stout old goat to ride!
LINE 8: The way is long; and I would rather spare me
LINE 9: This uphill work.
LINE 10: Faust.
LINE 11: While my good legs can bear me,
LINE 12: This knotted stick will serve my end.
LINE 13: What boots it to cut short the way?
LINE 14: Through the long labyrinth of vales to wend,
LINE 15: These rugged mountain-steeps to climb,
LINE 16: And hear the gushing waters' ceaseless chime,
LINE 17: No better seasoning on my wish to-day
LINE 18: Could wait, to make the Brocken banquet prime!
LINE 19: The Spring is waving in the birchen bower,
LINE 20: And ev'n the pine begins to feel its power;
LINE 21: Shall we alone be strangers to its sway?
LINE 22: Mephistopheles.
LINE 23: No whiff I feel that hath a smell of May;
LINE 24: I am most wintry cold in every limb;
LINE 25: I'd sooner track my road o'er frost and snow.
LINE 26: How sadly mounts the imperfect moon!--so dim
LINE 27: Shines forth its red disk, with belated glow,
LINE 28: We run the risk, at every step, on stones
LINE 29: Or stumps of crazy trees, to break our bones.
LINE 30: You must allow me to request the aid
LINE 31: Of a Will-o-the-Wisp;--I see one right ahead,
LINE 32: And in the bog it blazes merrily.
LINE 33: Holla! my good friend! dare I be so free?
LINE 34: Two travellers here stand much in need of thee;
LINE 35: Why should'st thou waste thy flickering flame in vain?
LINE 36: Pray be so good as light us up the hill!
LINE 37: Will-o-the-Wisp.
LINE 38: Out of respect to you, I will restrain,
LINE 39: If possible, my ever-shifting will;
LINE 40: But all our natural genius, and our skill
LINE 41: Is zigzag; straight lines go against the grain.
LINE 42: Mephistopheles.
LINE 43: Ha! ha! hast learned from men how to declaim?
LINE 44: March on, I tell thee, in the Devil's name!
LINE 45: Else will I blow thy flickering life-spark out.
LINE 46: Will-o-the-Wisp.
LINE 47: You are the master of the house, no doubt,
LINE 48: And therefore I obey you cheerfully.
LINE 49: Only remember! 'tis the first of May,
LINE 50: The Brocken is as mad as mad can be;
LINE 51: And when an _ignis fatuus_ leads the way,
LINE 52: You have yourselves to blame, if you should stray.
LINE 53: Faust, Mephistopheles, and Will-o-the-Wisp. [_in reciprocal song_]
LINE 54: Through the realms of fairy dreaming,
LINE 55: Through the air with magic teeming,
LINE 56: Guide us forward, guide us fairly,
LINE 57: Thanks to thee be rendered rarely;
LINE 58: Guide us quick, and guide us sure,
LINE 59: O'er the wide waste Brocken moor.
LINE 60: Trees on trees thick massed before us
LINE 61: Flit, and fling dark shadows o'er us,
LINE 62: Cliffs on cliffs in rugged masses
LINE 63: Nod above the narrow passes,
LINE 64: And each rock from jagged nose,
LINE 65: How it snorts, and how it blows!
LINE 66: Over turf and stones are pouring
LINE 67: Stream and streamlet, wildly roaring;
LINE 68: Is it rustling? is it singing?
LINE 69: Love's sweet plaint with gentle winging!
LINE 70: Voices of those days, the dearest,
LINE 71: When our light of hope was clearest!
LINE 72: And the echo, like the sounds
LINE 73: Of ancient story, back rebounds.
LINE 74: Oohoo! Shoohoo! what a riot!
LINE 75: Owl and pewit, jay and piet!
LINE 76: Will no bird to-night be quiet?
LINE 77: What is this? red salamanders,
LINE 78: With long legs and swoll'n paunches,
LINE 79: Weaving wreathy fire-meanders
LINE 80: Through the thicket's bristling branches!
LINE 81: And the trees, their roots outspreading
LINE 82: From the sand and rocky bedding,
LINE 83: Winding, stretching, twisting grimly,
LINE 84: Through the dun air darting dimly
LINE 85: Seek to seize us, seek to grasp us,
LINE 86: And with snaky coils enclasp us!
LINE 87: And the mice in motley muster,
LINE 88: Red and white, and blue and grey,
LINE 89: Thick as bees that hang in cluster,
LINE 90: Crowd along the heathy way.
LINE 91: And the fire-flies shooting lightly
LINE 92: Through the weirdly winding glade,
LINE 93: With bewildering escort, brightly
LINE 94: Lead the streaming cavalcade!
LINE 95: But tell me, in this strange confusion,
LINE 96: What is real, what delusion?
LINE 97: Do we walk with forward faces,
LINE 98: Or stand and halt with baffled paces?
LINE 99: All things seem to change their places,
LINE 100: Rocks and trees to make grimaces,
LINE 101: And the lights in witchy row,
LINE 102: Twinkle more and more they blow!
LINE 103: Mephistopheles.
LINE 104: Hold me tightly by the cue!
LINE 105: From this hillock, we may view,
LINE 106: At leisure, with admiring gaze,
LINE 107: How Mammon in the mount doth blaze!
LINE 108: Faust.
LINE 109: How strangely through the glooming glens
LINE 110: Dim sheen, like morning redness, glimmers!
LINE 111: Ev'n to the darkest, deepest dens
LINE 112: With its long streaky rays it shimmers.
LINE 113: Here mounts the smoke, there rolls the steam,
LINE 114: There flames through the white vapors gleam,
LINE 115: Here like a thread along the mountain
LINE 116: It creeps; there gushes in a fountain!
LINE 117: Here stretching out, in many a rood,
LINE 118: Along the vale, its vein√®d flood,
LINE 119: And here at once it checks its flight,
LINE 120: And bursts in globes of studded light.
LINE 121: There sparks are showering on the ground,
LINE 122: Like golden sand besprinkled round,
LINE 123: And lo! where all the rocky height,
LINE 124: From head to foot is bathed in light!
LINE 125: Mephistopheles.
LINE 126: Hath not old Mammon lit with goodly flame
LINE 127: His palace for the jubilee?
LINE 128: Thou art in luck to see the game;
LINE 129: Even now I scent the lusty company.
LINE 130: Faust.
LINE 131: How the mad storm doth howl and hiss
LINE 132: And beats my neck with angry buffeting!
LINE 133: Mephistopheles.
LINE 134: To the old mountain's hard ribs cling,
LINE 135: Or the strong blast will hurl thee down the abyss;
LINE 136: The night with clouds is overcast;
LINE 137: Hear in the woods the grinding of the blast!
LINE 138: How the frightened owlets flit!
LINE 139: How the massive pillars split
LINE 140: Of the dark pine-palaces!
LINE 141: How the branches creak and break!
LINE 142: How the riven stems are groaning!
LINE 143: How the gaping roots are moaning!
LINE 144: In terrible confusion all,
LINE 145: One on another clashing, they fall,
LINE 146: And through the clefts, where their wrecks are buried,
LINE 147: Hissing and howling the winds are hurried.
LINE 148: Sounds of voices dost thou hear?
LINE 149: Voices far, and voices near?
LINE 150: And, all the mountain-side along,
LINE 151: Streams a raving wizard song.
LINE 152: Witches. [_in chorus_]
LINE 153: The witches to the Brocken ride,
LINE 154: The stubble is yellow, the corn is green;
LINE 155: A merry crew to a merry scene,
LINE 156: And good Sir Urian is the guide.[*n10]
LINE 157: Over stock and stone we float,
LINE 158: Wrinkled hag and rank old goat.
LINE 159: A Voice.
LINE 160: Old mother Baubo comes up now,
LINE 161: Alone, and riding on a sow.
LINE 162: Chorus.
LINE 163: Honor to him to whom honor is due!
LINE 164: Lady Baubo heads the crew!
LINE 165: On the back of a sow, with the wings of the wind,
LINE 166: And all the host of witches behind.
LINE 167: A Voice.
LINE 168: Sister, which way came you?
LINE 169: A Voice.
LINE 170: By Ilsenstein! and I looked into
LINE 171: An owlet's nest, as on I fared,
LINE 172: That with its two eyes broadly stared!
LINE 173: A Voice.
LINE 174: The deuce! at what a devil's pace
LINE 175: You go; this march is not a race.
LINE 176: A Voice.
LINE 177: It tore me, it flayed me!
LINE 178: These red wounds it made me!
LINE 179: Witches. [_in chorus_]
LINE 180: The road is broad, the road is long,
LINE 181: Why crowd you so on one another?
LINE 182: Scrapes the besom, pricks the prong,
LINE 183: Chokes the child, and bursts the mother.
LINE 184: Wizards. [_semi-chorus_]
LINE 185: We trail us on, like very snails,
LINE 186: The women fly with flaunting sails;
LINE 187: For, when we run Squire Satan's races,
LINE 188: They always win by a thousand paces.
LINE 189: Semi-Chorus.
LINE 190: Not quite so bad: the women need
LINE 191: A thousand paces to help their speed;
LINE 192: But let them speed what most they can,
LINE 193: With one spring comes up the man.
LINE 194: Voice. [_from above_]
LINE 195: Come up! come up from the lake with me.
LINE 196: Voices. [_from below_]
LINE 197: Right gladly would we mount with thee;
LINE 198: We wash, and wash, and cease from washing never;
LINE 199: Our skins are as white as white can be,
LINE 200: But we are as dry and barren as ever.
LINE 201: Both Choruses.
LINE 202: The wind is hushed, the stars take flight,
LINE 203: The sullen moon hath veiled her light,
LINE 204: The magic choir from whizzing wings,
LINE 205: Long lines of sparkling glory flings.
LINE 206: Voice. [_from below_]
LINE 207: Stop, stop!
LINE 208: Voice. [_from above_]
LINE 209: Who bawls so loud from the cleft?
LINE 210: Voice. [_from below_]
LINE 211: Let me go with you! let me not be left!
LINE 212: Three hundred years I grope and grope
LINE 213: Round the base and up the slope,
LINE 214: But still the summit cheats my hope.
LINE 215: I fain would be a merry guest
LINE 216: At Satan's banquet with the rest.
LINE 217: Both Choruses.
LINE 218: On broomstick, and on lusty goat,
LINE 219: On pitchfork, and on stick, we float;
LINE 220: And he, to-day who cannot soar,
LINE 221: Is a lost man for evermore.
LINE 222: Half-Witch. [_below_]
LINE 223: I hobble on behind them all,
LINE 224: The others scarcely hear my call!
LINE 225: I find no rest at home: and here,
LINE 226: I limp on lamely in the rear.
LINE 227: Chorus of Witches.
LINE 228: The ointment gives our sinews might,[*n11]
LINE 229: For us each rag is sail enough,
LINE 230: We find a ship in every trough;
LINE 231: Whoso will fly must fly to-night.
LINE 232: Both Choruses.
LINE 233: While we upon the summit ride,
LINE 234: Be yours to sweep along the side;
LINE 235: Up and down, and far and wide,
LINE 236: On the left, and on the right,
LINE 237: Witch and wizard massed together,
LINE 238: Scour the moor and sweep the heather,
LINE 239: Bravely on Walpurgis-night!
LINE 240: [_They alight._
LINE 241: Mephistopheles.
LINE 242: What a thronging, and jolting, and rolling, and rattling!
LINE 243: What a whizzing, and whirling, and jostling, and battling!
LINE 244: What a sparkling, and blazing, and stinking, and burning!
LINE 245: And witches that all topsy-turvy are turning!--
LINE 246: Hold fast by me, or I shall lose you quite,
LINE 247: Where are you?
LINE 248: Faust. [_at a distance_]
LINE 249: Here!
LINE 250: Mephistopheles.
LINE 251: What! so far in the rear!
LINE 252: Why then 'tis time that I should use my right,
LINE 253: As master of the house to-night.
LINE 254: Make way! Squire Voland comes,[*n12] sweet mob, make way!
LINE 255: Here, Doctor, hold by me!--and now, I say,
LINE 256: We must cut clear
LINE 257: Of this wild hubbub, while we may;
LINE 258: Even my cloth is puzzled here.
LINE 259: See'st thou that light on yonder mound quite near,
LINE 260: It hath a most peculiar glare,
LINE 261: We'll slip in there,
LINE 262: And watch behind the bush the humors of the Fair.
LINE 263: Faust.
LINE 264: Strange son of contradiction!--may'st even guide us!
LINE 265: A rare conceit! of course you must be right;
LINE 266: This weary way we march on famed Walpurgis night,
LINE 267: Like hermits in a corner here to hide us!
LINE 268: Mephistopheles.
LINE 269: Lo! where the flames mount up with bickering glee;
LINE 270: In sooth it is a goodly company.
LINE 271: In such a place one cannot be alone.
LINE 272: Faust.
LINE 273: And yet a place I'd rather own
LINE 274: Upon the top, where whirling smoke I see;
LINE 275: There thousands to the evil Spirit hie,
LINE 276: And many a riddle there he will untie.
LINE 277: Mephistopheles.
LINE 278: Yes: and for every knot he disentangles,
LINE 279: He'll make another to produce new wrangles.
LINE 280: Let the great world rant and riot,
LINE 281: We'll know to house us here in quiet;
LINE 282: In the great world 'tis a sanctioned plan,
LINE 283: Each makes a little world the best he can.
LINE 284: Look there; you see young witches without cover,
LINE 285: And old ones prudently veiled over;
LINE 286: Yield but to me, and I can promise thee,
LINE 287: With little labor, mickle glee.
LINE 288: I hear their noisy instruments begin!
LINE 289: Confound their scraping!--one must bear the din.
LINE 290: Come, come! what must be must be--let's go in!
LINE 291: With my good introduction on this night,
LINE 292: Thou shalt have laughter to thy heart's delight.
LINE 293: What say'st thou, friend? this is no common show,
LINE 294: A hundred lights are burning in a row,
LINE 295: You scarce may see the end;
LINE 296: They dance, they talk, they cook, they drink, they court;
LINE 297: Now tell me, saw you ever better sport?
LINE 298: Faust.
LINE 299: Say, in what character do you intend
LINE 300: To appear here, and introduce your friend?
LINE 301: Devil or conjurer?
LINE 302: Mephistopheles.
LINE 303: I love incognito,
LINE 304: Yet on a gala-day my order I may show;
LINE 305: And, though a garter here is but of small avail,
LINE 306: The famous horse's foot I ne'er yet knew to fail.
LINE 307: See even now that cautious creeping snail!
LINE 308: With her long feeling visage, she
LINE 309: Has smelt out something of hell in me.
LINE 310: Do what I can, they have a snout,
LINE 311: In this keen air to scent me out;
LINE 312: Come! come; from fire to fire we roam; the game
LINE 313: Be mine to start, and yours to woo the dame.
LINE 314: [_To some who are sitting round a glimmering coal-fire._]
LINE 315: Why mope you here, old sirs, toasting your toes?
LINE 316: Methinks your Brocken hours were better spent
LINE 317: Amid the youthful roar and merriment;
LINE 318: One is enough alone at home, God knows.
LINE 319: General.
LINE 320: Who would rely upon the faith of nations!
LINE 321: They leave you thankless, when their work is done;
LINE 322: The people, like the women, pour libations
LINE 323: Only in honor of the rising sun.
LINE 324: Minister.
LINE 325: The liberties these modern changes bring,
LINE 326: I must confess I cannot praise;
LINE 327: The good old times, when we were everything,
LINE 328: These were the truly golden days.
LINE 329: Parvenu.
LINE 330: We, too, pushed forward with the pushing crew,
LINE 331: And for the need could stretch a point or two;
LINE 332: But now all's changed; and with the whirling bucket,
LINE 333: We lose the fruit, just when our hand would pluck it.
LINE 334: Author.
LINE 335: No solid work now suits the reading nation,
LINE 336: And year by year the world more shallow grows;
LINE 337: And, for the glib-tongued rising generation,
LINE 338: They hang their wisdom on their up-turned nose!
LINE 339: Mephistopheles. [_Who all at once appears very old_]
LINE 340: The people here seem ripe for Doom's day; I
LINE 341: Suspect the world is now on its last legs;
LINE 342: And, since mine own good cask is running dry,
LINE 343: Men and their ways, I guess, are near the dregs!
LINE 344: Peddler-Witch.
LINE 345: Good sirs, I pray you pass not by,
LINE 346: Cast on my wares a friendly eye!
LINE 347: One cannot see such rich display
LINE 348: Of curious trinkets every day.
LINE 349: Yet is there nothing in my store
LINE 350: (Which far all other stores excels),
LINE 351: That hath not done some mischief sore
LINE 352: To earth, and all on earth that dwells;
LINE 353: No dagger by which blood hath not been shed,
LINE 354: No cup from which, through sound and healthy life,
LINE 355: Corroding fiery juice hath not been spread,
LINE 356: No gaud but hath seduced some lovely wife,
LINE 357: No sword that hath not made a truce miscarry,
LINE 358: Or stabbed behind the back its adversary.
LINE 359: Mephistopheles.
LINE 360: Good lady cousin! you come rather late.
LINE 361: Your wares, believe me, are quite out of date;
LINE 362: Deal in the new and newest; that
LINE 363: Our palate smacks; all else is flat.
LINE 364: Faust.
LINE 365: This is a fair that beats the Leipzig hollow!
LINE 366: My head is so confused, I scarce can follow.
LINE 367: Mephistopheles.
LINE 368: To the top the stream is rushing,
LINE 369: And we are pushed, when we think we are pushing.
LINE 370: Faust.
LINE 371: Who, then, is that?
LINE 372: Mephistopheles.
LINE 373: Look at her well.
LINE 374: 'Tis Lilith.[*n13]
LINE 375: Faust.
LINE 376: Who?
LINE 377: Mephistopheles.
LINE 378: Adam's first wife. Beware,
LINE 379: Art thou a wise man, of her glossy hair!
LINE 380: 'Tis fair to look on, but its look is fell.
LINE 381: Those locks with which she outshines all the train,
LINE 382: When she hath bound a young man with that chain,
LINE 383: She'll hold him fast; he'll scarce come back again.
LINE 384: Faust.
LINE 385: There sit an old and young one on the sward;
LINE 386: They seem to have been dancing somewhat hard.
LINE 387: Mephistopheles.
LINE 388: O! once begun, they'll go on like the devil.
LINE 389: Come, come! they rise again--let's join the revel.
LINE 390: [/Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/ _join the dance; the former
LINE 391: with the Young Witch as his partner; the latter with the Old one._
LINE 392: Faust. [_dancing with the young Witch_]
LINE 393: A lovely dream once came to me,
LINE 394: I saw in my sleep an apple-tree;
LINE 395: Two lovely apples on it did shine;
LINE 396: I clomb the pole to make them mine.
LINE 397: The Young Witch.
LINE 398: For apples your sire in Paradise
LINE 399: And primal dame had longing eyes:
LINE 400: And, if your eyes are wise to see,
LINE 401: You'll find such apples on my tree.
LINE 402: Mephistopheles. [_dancing with the old Witch_]
LINE 403: An ugly dream once came to me,
LINE 404: I dreamed I saw a cloven tree;
LINE 405: In the tree there sat an ugly owl;
LINE 406: I called it fair, though it was foul.
LINE 407: The Old Witch.
LINE 408: My best salute this night shall be,
LINE 409: Thou knight of the cloven foot, to thee;
LINE 410: A cloven tree with an ugly owl,
LINE 411: And I for thee, or fair, or foul.
LINE 412: Proctophantasmist.[*n14] [_to the dancers_]
LINE 413: Listen to order, you presumptuous brood!
LINE 414: Have we not proved beyond disputing,
LINE 415: That ghosts on terra firma have no footing?
LINE 416: And yet you dance like any flesh and blood?
LINE 417: The Young Witch. [_dancing_]
LINE 418: What wants he here, that rude-like fellow there?
LINE 419: Faust. [_dancing_]
LINE 420: O, he is everywhere!
LINE 421: What others dance 'tis his to prize;
LINE 422: Each step he cannot criticise
LINE 423: Had as well not been made. But in the dance
LINE 424: It grieves him most when we advance.
LINE 425: If we would wheel still round and round in a ring,
LINE 426: As he is fond to do in his old mill,
LINE 427: He would not take it half so ill;
LINE 428: Especially if you take care to bring
LINE 429: Your praiseful offering to his master skill.
LINE 430: Proctophantasmist.
LINE 431: What! still there, phantoms? this is past endurance!
LINE 432: In this enlightened age you have the assurance
LINE 433: To show your face and play your tricks undaunted;
LINE 434: We are so wise, and yet a man's own house is haunted.
LINE 435: How long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion,
LINE 436: And still the world remains in the same wild confusion!
LINE 437: The Young Witch.
LINE 438: Be quiet then, and seek some other place!
LINE 439: Proctophantasmist.
LINE 440: I tell you, Spirits, in your face,
LINE 441: This intellectual thrall I cannot bear it;
LINE 442: I love to have a free unshackled spirit. [_The dance goes on._]
LINE 443: To-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain;
LINE 444: I've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils,
LINE 445: And hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again,
LINE 446: To crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils.
LINE 447: Mephistopheles.
LINE 448: He will now go, and, bare of breeches,
LINE 449: Sit in a pool with solemn patience;
LINE 450: And, when his buttocks are well sucked by leeches,
LINE 451: Be cured of ghosts and ghostly inspirations.
LINE 452: [_To_ /Faust/, _who has just left the dance._]
LINE 453: Why do you let the lovely damsel go,
LINE 454: That in the dance with sweet song pleased you so?
LINE 455: Faust.
LINE 456: Alas! while she so passing sweet was singing,
LINE 457: I saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing.
LINE 458: Mephistopheles.
LINE 459: Pooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course;
LINE 460: Let not such trifles mar your sweet discourse.
LINE 461: Go, join the crew, and dance away;
LINE 462: Enough, the red mouse was not gray.
LINE 463: Faust.
LINE 464: Then saw I--
LINE 465: Mephistopheles.
LINE 466: What?
LINE 467: Faust.
LINE 468: Mephisto, see'st thou there
LINE 469: A pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare?
LINE 470: From place to place she moveth slow;
LINE 471: With shackled feet she seems to go;
LINE 472: I must confess, she has a cast
LINE 473: Of Margaret, when I saw her last.
LINE 474: Mephistopheles.
LINE 475: Let that alone! it brings thee certain harm;
LINE 476: It is bewitched, a bloodless, breathless form,
LINE 477: For men to look upon it is not good.
LINE 478: Its fix√®d gaze hath power to freeze the blood,
LINE 479: And petrify thee stark and stiff.
LINE 480: Of course I need not ask you if
LINE 481: You've heard of the Medusa's head.
LINE 482: Faust.
LINE 483: In truth I see the eyes of one that's dead,
LINE 484: On which no closing hand of love was laid.
LINE 485: That is my Margaret's kindly breast,
LINE 486: That the sweet body I caressed.
LINE 487: Mephistopheles.
LINE 488: There lies the witchcraft o't, thou fool!
LINE 489: A phantom takes thy wit to school:
LINE 490: She is the love of every lover's brain.
LINE 491: Faust.
LINE 492: What ecstasy! and yet what pain!
LINE 493: I cannot leave it for my life.
LINE 494: How strangely this most lovely neck
LINE 495: A single streak of red doth deck,
LINE 496: No broader than the back o' a knife!
LINE 497: Mephistopheles.
LINE 498: Quite right! I see it, just as well as you.
LINE 499: Sometimes her head beneath her elbow too
LINE 500: She wears; for Perseus cut it off, you know.
LINE 501: What! will you still a-dreaming go?
LINE 502: Come, let us mount the hillock--there
LINE 503: We shall have noble sport, believe me;
LINE 504: For, unless mine eyes deceive me,
LINE 505: They have got up a theatre.
LINE 506: What make you here?
LINE 507: A Servant.
LINE 508: You are just come in time.
LINE 509: 'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven,
LINE 510: For such the number that with us is given.
LINE 511: A dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme,
LINE 512: And dilettanti are the actors too.
LINE 513: Excuse me, sirs,--no disrespect to you,
LINE 514: If I seem curt: I am the dilettante
LINE 515: To draw the curtain; and our time is scanty.
LINE 516: Mephistopheles.
LINE 517: Just so; I only wish you were so clever
LINE 518: To know your home;
LINE 519: Then from the Blocksberg you would never
LINE 520: Have lust to roam!
LINE 521: Scene II.
LINE 522: _Intermezzo._[*n15]
LINE 523: Walpurgis-Night's Dream;
LINE 524: or
LINE 525: Oberon and Titania's Golden Hightide.
LINE 526: Director of the Theatre.
LINE 527: We players here may take our ease;
LINE 528: For all we need for scenery
LINE 529: Is mount and mead, and trees, and seas
LINE 530: Of Nature's leafy greenery.
LINE 531: Herald.
LINE 532: The golden high-tide is it then,
LINE 533: When fifty years pass over;
LINE 534: But doubly golden is it when
LINE 535: All brawls and strifes they cover.
LINE 536: Oberon.
LINE 537: Ye spirits, who obey my law,
LINE 538: Are to this feast invited,
LINE 539: When Oberon and Titania
LINE 540: In love are reunited.
LINE 541: Puck.
LINE 542: Puck comes in first, and turns athwart,
LINE 543: His merry circles wheeling;
LINE 544: And hundreds more behind him dart,
LINE 545: Loud shouts of laughter pealing.
LINE 546: Ariel.
LINE 547: I fill the air with thrilling song
LINE 548: Of virtue quite enchanting;
LINE 549: Though ugly imps I lure along,
LINE 550: The fair are never wanting!
LINE 551: Oberon.
LINE 552: When man and wife begin to strive,
LINE 553: Just give them length of tether!
LINE 554: They will learn in peace to live,
LINE 555: When not too much together.
LINE 556: Titania.
LINE 557: When pouts the wife, and frets the man,
LINE 558: This cure is best in Nature,
LINE 559: Him to the Arctic circle ban,
LINE 560: And her to the Equator.
LINE 561: Orchestra. [_Tutti. Fortissimo_]
LINE 562: Snout of fly, and nose of gnat,
LINE 563: Lead on the band before us!
LINE 564: Frog and cricket, cat and bat,
LINE 565: Join merry in the chorus!
LINE 566: Solo.
LINE 567: A soap-bell for a doodle-sack,[*3]
LINE 568: The merry waters troubling!
LINE 569: Hear the snecke-snicke-snack,
LINE 570: From its snub-nose bubbling!
LINE 571: Embryo-Spirit.
LINE 572: Legs of spider, paunch of toad,
LINE 573: And wings, if you would know it;
LINE 574: Nor fish, nor fowl, but on the road
LINE 575: Perhaps to be a poet!
LINE 576: A Pair of Dancers.
LINE 577: With many a nimble pace and spring,
LINE 578: Through honey-dew and vapour,
LINE 579: Trips o'er the ground the little thing,
LINE 580: But higher cannot caper.
LINE 581: Inquisitive Traveller.
LINE 582: Do I see a real thing,
LINE 583: Or is it all delusion?
LINE 584: Oberon, the fairy king,
LINE 585: Amid this wild confusion.
LINE 586: Orthodox.
LINE 587: Though neither tail nor claws are his,
LINE 588: 'Tis true beyond all cavil,
LINE 589: As devils were the gods of Greece,
LINE 590: He too must be a devil.
LINE 591: Northern Artist.
LINE 592: 'Tis but a sketch, I must admit;
LINE 593: But what I can't unravel
LINE 594: To-night, I'll know, with larger wit,
LINE 595: From my Italian travel.
LINE 596: Purist.
LINE 597: Alas! that I should see it too!
LINE 598: Here we a riot rare have!
LINE 599: Of all the crew, there are but two
LINE 600: That powder on their hair have.
LINE 601: Young Witch.
LINE 602: Powder and petticoat for grey
LINE 603: And wrinkled hags are fitting;
LINE 604: But I my lusty limbs display,
LINE 605: Upon a he-goat sitting.
LINE 606: Matron.
LINE 607: To speak with such a shameless pack
LINE 608: We have nor will nor leisure;
LINE 609: Soon may your flesh rot on your back,
LINE 610: And we look on with pleasure!
LINE 611: Leader of the Orchestra.
LINE 612: Snout of fly, and nose of gnat,
LINE 613: Sting not the naked beauty!
LINE 614: Frog and cricket, cat and bat,
LINE 615: Attend ye to your duty!
LINE 616: Weathercock. [_to the one side_]
LINE 617: A goodly company! as sure
LINE 618: As I stand on the steeple;
LINE 619: With brides and bridegrooms swarms the moor,
LINE 620: The hopefulest of people!
LINE 621: Weathercock. [_to the other side_]
LINE 622: And opes not suddenly the ground,
LINE 623: To swallow one and all up,
LINE 624: Then, with a jerk, I'll veer me round,
LINE 625: And straight to hell I'll gallop.
LINE 626: Xenien.
LINE 627: We insects keep them all in awe,
LINE 628: With sharpest scissors shear we!
LINE 629: Old Nick, our worthy Squire Papa,
LINE 630: Here to salute appear we.
LINE 631: Hennings.
LINE 632: See! how in merry circles they
LINE 633: Sit gossiping together;
LINE 634: The graceless crew have hearts, they say,
LINE 635: As good as any other.
LINE 636: Musagetes.
LINE 637: This witch and wizard crew to lead,
LINE 638: My willing fancy chooses;
LINE 639: More hopeful field is here indeed,
LINE 640: Than when I lead the Muses.
LINE 641: Ci-devant Genius of the Age.
LINE 642: The Brocken has a good broad back,
LINE 643: Like the High-Dutch Parnassus;
LINE 644: The Jury here no man can pack,
LINE 645: Or with proud silence pass us.
LINE 646: Inquisitive Traveller.
LINE 647: Say, who is he so stiff that goes,
LINE 648: That stately-stalking stranger?
LINE 649: He snuffs for Jesuits with sharp nose,
LINE 650: And cries--the Church in danger!
LINE 651: Crane.
LINE 652: In muddy waters do I fish
LINE 653: As well as where it clear is,
LINE 654: And only for such cause as this
LINE 655: The pious man too here is.
LINE 656: Worldling.
LINE 657: Yes! though the saints declare that sin
LINE 658: And Blocksberg are identical,
LINE 659: Yet here, amid this demon din,
LINE 660: They'll set up their conventicle.
LINE 661: Dancer.
LINE 662: A sound of drums! a sound of men!
LINE 663: That wafted on the wind came!--
LINE 664: The weary bitterns in the fen
LINE 665: Are booming--never mind 'em!
LINE 666: Dancing-Master.
LINE 667: Lo! how they kick, and how they jump!
LINE 668: How well each figure shown is!
LINE 669: Springs the crooked, hops the plump!
LINE 670: Each thinks him an Adonis!
LINE 671: A Good Fellow.
LINE 672: A sorry lot! What muffled ire
LINE 673: Their swelling breasts inflames here!
LINE 674: The beasts were tamed by Orpheus' lyre,
LINE 675: And them the bagpipe tames here!
LINE 676: Professor of Systematic Theology.
LINE 677: I let no one bamboozle me
LINE 678: With doubts and critic cavils;
LINE 679: The devil sure must something be,
LINE 680: Else whence so many devils?
LINE 681: Idealist.
LINE 682: Imagination travels free
LINE 683: Without or rein or rule here;
LINE 684: If I am all that now I see,
LINE 685: Myself must be a fool here.
LINE 686: Realist.
LINE 687: That on the Brocken ghosts appear
LINE 688: Now scarce admits disputing;
LINE 689: Amid this hurly burly here
LINE 690: I've fairly lost my footing.
LINE 691: Supernaturalist.
LINE 692: Into this swarming hellish brood
LINE 693: I come, without intrusion;
LINE 694: From evil spirits to the good,
LINE 695: It is a just conclusion.
LINE 696: Sceptic.
LINE 697: They chase the flame that flits about,
LINE 698: And deem them near their treasure;
LINE 699: Best rhymes with doubt this demon-rout,
LINE 700: And I look on with pleasure.
LINE 701: Leader of the Orchestra.
LINE 702: Snout of fly, and nose of gnat,
LINE 703: Ye stupid Dilettanti!
LINE 704: Frog and cricket, cat and bat,
LINE 705: Keep better time, why can't ye?
LINE 706: Clever Spirits.
LINE 707: _Sans-souci_ is hight the crew
LINE 708: On limber limbs that ply it;
LINE 709: When on our feet it will not do,
LINE 710: Then on our heads we try it.
LINE 711: Awkward Spirits.
LINE 712: With once or twice a lucky throw
LINE 713: We tramped the road together;
LINE 714: But now we flounder on, and show
LINE 715: Our toes outside the leather!
LINE 716: Ignes Fatui.
LINE 717: Though born but with the sultry ray
LINE 718: This morn, in the morass all,
LINE 719: Yet now, amid the gallants gay,
LINE 720: We shine here and surpass all.
LINE 721: Falung Star.
LINE 722: Last night I shot from starry sky
LINE 723: And fell upon my nose here;
LINE 724: Will no one come where flat I lie,
LINE 725: And plant me on my toes here?
LINE 726: Stout Spirits.
LINE 727: Make way, make way! and brush the dew
LINE 728: Right bravely from the lawn here;
LINE 729: Spirits we are, but Spirits too
LINE 730: Can show both pith and brawn here!
LINE 731: Puck.
LINE 732: Why tramp ye so majestical
LINE 733: As cub of river-horse is?
LINE 734: The plumpest spirit of you all
LINE 735: Stout Puck himself of course is.
LINE 736: Ariel.
LINE 737: If loving Nature's bounteous care
LINE 738: Hath fitted you with pinions,
LINE 739: Then cleave with me the yielding air
LINE 740: To rosy bright dominions.
LINE 741: Orchestra.
LINE 742: The mist draws off, and overhead
LINE 743: All clear and bright the air is,
LINE 744: And with the rustling breeze are fled
LINE 745: The devils and the fairies!
LINE 746: /end of the interlude./
LINE 747: Scene III.
LINE 748: _A cloudy day. The Fields._
LINE 749: /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 750: Faust.
LINE 751: In misery! in despair! Wandering in hopeless wretchedness over the
LINE 752: wide earth, and at last made prisoner! Shut up like a malefactor in a
LINE 753: dungeon, victim of the most horrible woes--poor miserable girl! Must
LINE 754: it then come to this? Thou treacherous and worthless Spirit! this
LINE 755: hast thou concealed from me!--Stand thou there! stand!--Roll round
LINE 756: thy fiendish eyes, infuriate in thy head! Stand and confront me with
LINE 757: thy insupportable presence. A prisoner! in irredeemable misery! given
LINE 758: over to evil Spirits, and to the condemning voice of the unfeeling
LINE 759: world! and me, meanwhile, thou cradlest to sleep amid a host of the
LINE 760: most vapid dissipations, concealing from my knowledge her aggravated
LINE 761: woes!--while she--she is left in hopeless wretchedness to die!
LINE 762: Mephistopheles.
LINE 763: She's not the first.
LINE 764: Faust.
LINE 765: Dog! abominable monster!--Change him, O thou infinite Spirit! change
LINE 766: the reptile back again into his original form--the poodle that ran
LINE 767: before me in the twilight, now cowering at the feet of the harmless
LINE 768: wanderer, now springing on his shoulders!--Change him again into his
LINE 769: favorite shape, that he may crouch on his belly in the sand before
LINE 770: me, and I may tramp him underneath my feet, the reprobate!--Not the
LINE 771: first! Misery, misery! by no human soul to be conceived! that more
LINE 772: than one creature of God should ever have been plunged into the depth
LINE 773: of this woe! that the first, in the writhing agony of her death,
LINE 774: should not have atoned for the guilt of all the rest before the eyes
LINE 775: of the All-merciful! It digs even into the marrow of my life, the
LINE 776: misery of this _one_; and thou--thou grinnest in cold composure over
LINE 777: the wretchedness of thousands!
LINE 778: Mephistopheles.
LINE 779: Here we are arrived once more at the limit of our wits, where the
LINE 780: thread of human reason snaps in sunder. Wherefore seekest thou
LINE 781: communion with us, unless thou would'st carry it through? Would'st
LINE 782: fly, and yet art not proof against giddiness? Did we thrust ourselves
LINE 783: on you, or you on us?
LINE 784: Faust.
LINE 785: Whet not thy rows of voracious teeth at me! I loathe it!--Great and
LINE 786: glorious Spirit, who didst condescend to reveal thyself to me, who
LINE 787: knowest my heart and my soul, wherefore didst thou yoke me to this
LINE 788: vilest of complices, who feeds on mischief and banquets on
LINE 789: destruction?
LINE 790: Mephistopheles.
LINE 791: Art done?
LINE 792: Faust.
LINE 793: Deliver her! or woe thee!--the direst of curses lie on thee forever!
LINE 794: Mephistopheles.
LINE 795: I cannot loose the bonds of the avenger, nor open his bars.--Deliver
LINE 796: her! Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I or thou?
LINE 797: [/Faust/ _looks wildly round._
LINE 798: Mephistopheles. [_continues_]
LINE 799: Would'st grasp the thunder? 'Tis well that you, poor mortals, have it
LINE 800: not to wield! To smash the innocent in pieces is the proper tyrant's
LINE 801: fashion of venting one's spleen in a dilemma.
LINE 802: Faust.
LINE 803: Bring me to her! She shall be free!
LINE 804: Mephistopheles.
LINE 805: And the danger to which thou exposest thyself! Know that the guilt of
LINE 806: blood from thy hand still lies upon the town. Above the spot where
LINE 807: the slain fell, avenging Spirits hover and lie in wait for the
LINE 808: returning murderer.
LINE 809: Faust.
LINE 810: That too from thee? Murder and death of a world on thee, thou
LINE 811: monster! Bring me to her, I say, and deliver her!
LINE 812: Mephistopheles.
LINE 813: I'll lead thee thither, and what I can do that I will do. Mark me!
LINE 814: Have I all power in heaven and on earth? I will cloud the wits of
LINE 815: the warder, and thou may'st seize the keys, and bring her out with
LINE 816: the hand of a man. I wait for you with the magic horses to ensure
LINE 817: your escape. This I can do.
LINE 818: Faust.
LINE 819: Up and away!
LINE 820: Scene IV.
LINE 821: _Night. The open Field._
LINE 822: /Faust. Mephistopheles/.
LINE 823: (_Galloping past on black horses._)
LINE 824: Faust.
LINE 825: What are they about there, bustling round the Ravenstone?[*4]
LINE 826: Mephistopheles.
LINE 827: Can't say what they are cooking and kitchening.
LINE 828: Faust.
LINE 829: They hover up, they hover down, bending and bowing.
LINE 830: Mephistopheles.
LINE 831: A corporation of Witches.
LINE 832: Faust.
LINE 833: They seem to be sprinkling and blessing something.
LINE 834: Mephistopheles.
LINE 835: On! on!
LINE 836: Scene V.
LINE 837: _A Prison._
LINE 838: /Faust/, _with a bundle of keys in his hand and a lamp, before an
LINE 839: iron door._
LINE 840: Faust.
LINE 841: A strange cold shuddering dread comes o'er me, all
LINE 842: The up-heaped wretchedness of time.
LINE 843: Here dwells she now behind this damp cold wall,
LINE 844: And dear delusion was her only crime!
LINE 845: Fear'st thou to go to her?
LINE 846: Tremblest to meet her eye?
LINE 847: Quick! thy delay but brings her death more nigh.
LINE 848: [_He seizes the lock. Singing heard from within._
LINE 849: My mother, the wanton,
LINE 850: That choked my breath![*n16]
LINE 851: My father, the villain,
LINE 852: That dined on my death!
LINE 853: My sister dear,
LINE 854: In the cool green shade
LINE 855: My bones she laid;
LINE 856: Then was I a glad little bird in the May;
LINE 857: Fly away! fly away!
LINE 858: Faust. [_opening the door_]
LINE 859: She dreams not that her loved one is so near,
LINE 860: The clinking chains and rustling straw to hear.
LINE 861: Margaret. [_hiding herself on the bed_]
LINE 862: Woe, woe! they come.--To bitter death they call.
LINE 863: Faust. [_softly_]
LINE 864: Hush! hush! I come to free thee from their thrall!
LINE 865: Margaret. [_throwing herself at his feet_]
LINE 866: Art thou a man? feel for my hapless plight.
LINE 867: Faust.
LINE 868: Thy cries will wake the watchers of the night!
LINE 869: [_He takes hold of the chains to unloose them._
LINE 870: Margaret. [_on her knees_]
LINE 871: Who gave thee, hangman, such a power
LINE 872: To drag me from my cell at midnight hour?
LINE 873: Have pity on me! Be not so harsh!--so rough!
LINE 874: Surely to-morrow morn is soon enough. [_She stands up._]
LINE 875: So young, so very young, am I,
LINE 876: And must already die!
LINE 877: Once I was lovely too--'twas this that caused my fall.
LINE 878: Near was the friend, but far from me to-day;
LINE 879: Torn lies the wreath, the flowers are scattered all.
LINE 880: Oh tear me not so forcibly away!
LINE 881: Spare me! what have I done to injure thee?
LINE 882: Oh hear my prayer! for once compassion show!--
LINE 883: 'Tis the first time I ever looked on thee.
LINE 884: Faust.
LINE 885: That I should live to see such depth of woe!
LINE 886: Margaret.
LINE 887: Thou hast me now completely in thy might.
LINE 888: Only first give me time to suckle my sweet child.
LINE 889: I hugged it the whole weary night;
LINE 890: They took't from me in very spite;
LINE 891: And now they say I murdered the sweet child,
LINE 892: And never more shall I be glad again.
LINE 893: They sing songs on me, too!
LINE 894: A wicked thing to do!
LINE 895: 'Tis the refrain
LINE 896: Of a grim old melody:
LINE 897: Who taught them that its words were meant for me?
LINE 898: Faust. [_throwing himself down_]
LINE 899: Here, at thy feet, behold who loves thee fall,
LINE 900: To strike thy shackles, and to break thy thrall!
LINE 901: Margaret. [_falling beside him on her knees_]
LINE 902: Yes! let us kneel and call upon the Saints!
LINE 903: Beneath these steps,
LINE 904: I hear it well!
LINE 905: Beneath the threshold,
LINE 906: Boileth Hell!
LINE 907: The evil One
LINE 908: His fury vents,
LINE 909: With fearful yell!
LINE 910: Faust. [_loud_]
LINE 911: Gretchen! Gretchen!
LINE 912: Margaret. [_attentive_]
LINE 913: That was the loved one's voice!
LINE 914: [_She springs up; the chains fall away._]
LINE 915: Where is he? where? I heard him call on me,
LINE 916: Now I am free! and none shall hinder me!
LINE 917: To his neck will I fly!
LINE 918: On his bosom lie!
LINE 919: He called me his Gretchen! he stood at the door.
LINE 920: Through the wild howling and hissing of Hell,
LINE 921: Through the loud-laughing scorn and the fiendish uproar,
LINE 922: Came the sweet voice of love that I know so well.
LINE 923: Faust.
LINE 924: 'Tis I!
LINE 925: Margaret.
LINE 926: 'Tis thou! O say it yet again! [_Clasping him._]
LINE 927: 'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain?
LINE 928: Where all my prison's woe? my fetters where?
LINE 929: 'Tis he! he comes to lift me from this lair
LINE 930: Of wretchedness! I'm free, I'm free!
LINE 931: Already the well-known street I see,
LINE 932: Where the first time I spake to thee,
LINE 933: And the pleasant garden, where
LINE 934: Martha and I did wait for thee.
LINE 935: Faust. [_striving forward_]
LINE 936: Come, come!
LINE 937: Margaret.
LINE 938: O stay, stay!
LINE 939: Thou know'st how pleased I stay where thou dost stay.
LINE 940: [_Caressing him._
LINE 941: Faust.
LINE 942: Away, away!
LINE 943: Unless we haste,
LINE 944: Dearly we'll pay for these few moments' waste.
LINE 945: Margaret.
LINE 946: How! giv'st thou me no kiss?
LINE 947: My friend, so very short a space away,
LINE 948: And hast forgot to kiss?
LINE 949: Why feel I now so straitened when I hold
LINE 950: Thee in my arms? It was not so of old,
LINE 951: When from thy words and looks, a heaven of bliss
LINE 952: Came down; and thou didst kiss
LINE 953: As thou would'st smother me. Come, kiss me! kiss!
LINE 954: Else kiss I thee! [_She embraces him._]
LINE 955: O woe! thy lips are cold,
LINE 956: Are dumb;
LINE 957: Where is the love thy swelling bosom bore
LINE 958: Whilome for me? why are thy lips so cold?
LINE 959: [_She turns away from him._
LINE 960: Faust.
LINE 961: Come with me, sweet love, come!
LINE 962: I'll hug thee ten times closer than before,
LINE 963: Only come with me now! Come, I implore!
LINE 964: Margaret. [_turning to him_]
LINE 965: Art thou then _he_? Art thou then truly _he_?
LINE 966: Faust.
LINE 967: 'Tis I, in truth. Come, love, and follow me.
LINE 968: Margaret.
LINE 969: And these vile chains thou breakest,
LINE 970: And me again unto thy bosom takest?
LINE 971: How canst thou dare to turn fond eyes on me?
LINE 972: Know'st thou then, Henry, whom thou com'st to free?
LINE 973: Faust.
LINE 974: Come, come! the night sinks fast; come, follow me!
LINE 975: Margaret.
LINE 976: My mother slept a sleep profound!
LINE 977: I drugged her to't;
LINE 978: My little babe I drowned!
LINE 979: Was it not heaven's boon to me and thee?
LINE 980: Thee, too!--'tis thou! I scarce may deem
LINE 981: My sense speaks true. Give me thy hand!
LINE 982: It is no dream!
LINE 983: Thy dear, dear hand!
LINE 984: Alas! but it is wet!
LINE 985: Wipe it; for it is wet
LINE 986: With blood! O God! what hast thou done?
LINE 987: Put up thy sword;
LINE 988: I pray thee put it up.
LINE 989: Faust.
LINE 990: Let gone be gone!
LINE 991: Thou stabbest me with daggers, every word.
LINE 992: Margaret.
LINE 993: No! thou shalt survive our sorrow!
LINE 994: I will describe the graves to thee,
LINE 995: Where thou shalt bury them and me
LINE 996: To-morrow.
LINE 997: The best place thou shalt give my mother;
LINE 998: Close beside her lay my brother;
LINE 999: Me a little to the side,
LINE 1000: But at distance not too wide!
LINE 1001: And my child at my right breast.--
LINE 1002: These, and none else with us shall rest!
LINE 1003: Me on thy loving side to press,
LINE 1004: That was a heaven of blessedness!
LINE 1005: But now, I cannot do it more;
LINE 1006: I feel as I must force my love to thee,
LINE 1007: And thou didst coldly fling me back from thee;
LINE 1008: And yet 'tis thou!--as good, as loving as before.
LINE 1009: Faust.
LINE 1010: 'Tis I, even I, come, sweet love, come!
LINE 1011: Margaret.
LINE 1012: Out there?
LINE 1013: Faust.
LINE 1014: Into the open air.
LINE 1015: Margaret.
LINE 1016: If the grave be there,
LINE 1017: And death there waits, then come!
LINE 1018: Hence to my eternal home,
LINE 1019: Not a step more.--
LINE 1020: Thou leav'st me now?--would I might go with thee?
LINE 1021: Faust.
LINE 1022: Thou canst, if thou but wilt. I have unbarred the door.
LINE 1023: Margaret.
LINE 1024: I may not go; no hope for me remains;
LINE 1025: They watch me close--my home is with my chains.
LINE 1026: It is so sad to beg from door to door;
LINE 1027: A guilty thing from human loves outcast,
LINE 1028: A homeless earth to wander o'er;
LINE 1029: And they are sure to find me out at last.
LINE 1030: Faust.
LINE 1031: I will protect thee.
LINE 1032: Margaret.
LINE 1033: Quick! Quick!
LINE 1034: Save thy poor child!
LINE 1035: Away, away!
LINE 1036: Keep the path
LINE 1037: Up the stream,
LINE 1038: Across the bridge,
LINE 1039: To the left hand,
LINE 1040: Where the plank stands,
LINE 1041: In the pond,
LINE 1042: Seize it, quick!
LINE 1043: It rises up,
LINE 1044: It kicks! it lives!
LINE 1045: O save it, save it!
LINE 1046: Faust.
LINE 1047: Only bethink thee!
LINE 1048: One step more, and thou art free.
LINE 1049: Margaret.
LINE 1050: Would we were past that mountain gray!
LINE 1051: There sits my mother on a stone--
LINE 1052: I feel a hand that pulls me back
LINE 1053: As cold as clay!
LINE 1054: There sits my mother on a stone;
LINE 1055: Her head sways heavily;
LINE 1056: She winks not, she nods not, her head she may not raise.
LINE 1057: She slept so long, she never more may wake.
LINE 1058: She slept that we might our enjoyment take.
LINE 1059: O these were happy days!
LINE 1060: Faust.
LINE 1061: Here words and prayers will only make things worse;
LINE 1062: Come! come; or I must hale thee hence by force.
LINE 1063: Margaret.
LINE 1064: Let me alone! lay no rough hands on me!
LINE 1065: Nor with such murderous clutches seize me!
LINE 1066: Thou know'st I have done everything to please thee.
LINE 1067: Faust.
LINE 1068: The day dawns. Come, my Gretchen, follow me!
LINE 1069: Margaret.
LINE 1070: Day! yes, it is day! the Judgment-day breaks in!
LINE 1071: My marriage-day it should have been!
LINE 1072: Let no one know thou wert before with Margaret.
LINE 1073: Woe to my wreath!
LINE 1074: 'Tis done! oh, pain!
LINE 1075: We will meet again;
LINE 1076: But not at the dance.
LINE 1077: The thronging crowds advance
LINE 1078: With bated breath;
LINE 1079: No word is spoken;
LINE 1080: The squares, the streets,
LINE 1081: Cannot contain them all.
LINE 1082: The bell doth call,
LINE 1083: The staff is broken,
LINE 1084: They bind me with cords, they drag me away,
LINE 1085: And on the bloody block me lay;
LINE 1086: And every trembling eye doth quake
LINE 1087: At the blade that is brandished o'er my neck.
LINE 1088: Mute lies the world as the grave!
LINE 1089: Faust.
LINE 1090: O had I ne'er been born!
LINE 1091: Mephistopheles. [_appearing from without_]
LINE 1092: Up! or no help can save!
LINE 1093: Profitless whining, whimpering, and prating!
LINE 1094: Meanwhile my eager steeds are waiting,
LINE 1095: Snuffing the scent of the morning air.
LINE 1096: Margaret.
LINE 1097: What's that from the floor uprising there?
LINE 1098: 'Tis he! 'Tis he! O send his hateful face
LINE 1099: Away! What seeks he in this holy place?
LINE 1100: He comes for me!
LINE 1101: Faust.
LINE 1102: No! thou shalt live.
LINE 1103: Margaret.
LINE 1104: Judgment of God! to thee my soul I give.
LINE 1105: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 1106: Come, come! else will I leave you to your fate!
LINE 1107: Margaret.
LINE 1108: Thine am I, Father! O shut not the gate
LINE 1109: Of mercy on me!
LINE 1110: Ye angels! ye most holy Spirits! now
LINE 1111: Encamp around me! and protect me now!
LINE 1112: Henry, I tremble when I think on thee.
LINE 1113: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1114: She is judged!
LINE 1115: Voice. [_from above_]
LINE 1116: Is saved!
LINE 1117: Mephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]
LINE 1118: Hither to me!
LINE 1119: Voice. [_from within, dying away_]
LINE 1120: Henry! Henry!
LINE 1121: [The End]
