LINE 1: /The Lord/--/The Heavenly Hosts/: afterwards /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 2: Raphael.
LINE 3: The Sun doth chime his ancient music
LINE 4: 'Mid brothered spheres' contending song.
LINE 5: And on his fore-appointed journey
LINE 6: With pace of thunder rolls along.
LINE 7: Strength drink the angels from his glory,
LINE 8: Though none may throughly search his way:
LINE 9: God's works rehearse their wondrous story
LINE 10: As bright as on Creation's day.
LINE 11: Gabriel.
LINE 12: And swift and swift beyond conceiving
LINE 13: The pomp of earth is wheeled around,
LINE 14: Alternating Elysian brightness
LINE 15: With awful gloom of night profound.
LINE 16: Up foams the sea, a surging river,
LINE 17: And smites the steep rock's echoing base,
LINE 18: And rock and sea, unwearied ever,
LINE 19: Spin their eternal circling race.
LINE 20: Michael.
LINE 21: And storm meets storm with rival greeting,
LINE 22: From sea to land, from land to sea,
LINE 23: While from their war a virtue floweth,
LINE 24: That thrills with life all things that be.
LINE 25: The lightning darts his fury, blazing
LINE 26: Before the thunder's sounding way;
LINE 27: But still thy servants, Lord, are praising
LINE 28: The gentle going of thy day.
LINE 29: All the Three.
LINE 30: Strength drink the angels from thy glory,
LINE 31: Though none may search thy wondrous way;
LINE 32: Thy works repeat their radiant story,
LINE 33: As bright as on Creation's day.
LINE 34: Mephistopheles.
LINE 35: Sith thou, O Lord, approachest near,
LINE 36: And how we fare would'st fain have information,
LINE 37: And thou of old wert glad to see me here,
LINE 38: I stand to-day amid the courtly nation.
LINE 39: Pardon; no words of fine address I know,
LINE 40: Nor could, though all should hoot me down with sneers;
LINE 41: My pathos would move laughter, and not tears,
LINE 42: Wert thou not weaned from laughter long ago.
LINE 43: Of suns and worlds I've nought to say,
LINE 44: I only see how men must fret their lives away.
LINE 45: The little god o' the world jogs and jogs on, the same
LINE 46: As when from ruddy clay he took his name;
LINE 47: And, sooth to say, remains a riddle, just
LINE 48: As much as when you shaped him from the dust.
LINE 49: Perhaps a little better he had thriven,
LINE 50: Had he not got the show of glimmering light from heaven:
LINE 51: He calls it reason, and it makes him free
LINE 52: To be more brutish than a brute can be;
LINE 53: He is, methinks, with reverence of your grace,
LINE 54: Like one of the long-legg√®d race
LINE 55: Of grasshoppers that leap in the air, and spring,
LINE 56: And straightway in the grass the same old song they sing;
LINE 57: 'Twere well that from the grass he never rose,
LINE 58: On every stubble he must break his nose!
LINE 59: The Lord.
LINE 60: Hast thou then nothing more to say?
LINE 61: And art thou here again to-day
LINE 62: To vent thy grudge in peevish spite
LINE 63: Against the earth, still finding nothing right?
LINE 64: Mephistopheles.
LINE 65: True, Lord; I find things there no better than before;
LINE 66: I must confess I do deplore
LINE 67: Man's hopeless case, and scarce have heart myself
LINE 68: To torture the poor miserable elf.
LINE 69: The Lord.
LINE 70: Dost thou know Faust?
LINE 71: Mephistopheles.
LINE 72: The Doctor?
LINE 73: The Lord.
LINE 74: Ay: my servant.
LINE 75: Mephistopheles.
LINE 76: Indeed! and of his master's will observant,
LINE 77: In fashion quite peculiar to himself;
LINE 78: His food and drink are of no earthly taste,
LINE 79: A restless fever drives him to the waste.
LINE 80: Himself half seems to understand
LINE 81: How his poor wits have run astrand;
LINE 82: From heaven he asks each loveliest star,
LINE 83: Earth's chiefest joy must jump to his demand,
LINE 84: And all that's near, and all that's far,
LINE 85: Soothes not his deep-moved spirit's war.
LINE 86: The Lord.
LINE 87: Though for a time he blindly grope his way,
LINE 88: Soon will I lead him into open day;
LINE 89: Well knows the gardener, when green shoots appear,
LINE 90: That bloom and fruit await the ripening year.
LINE 91: Mephistopheles.
LINE 92: What wager you? you yet shall lose that soul!
LINE 93: Only give me full license, and you'll see
LINE 94: How I shall lead him softly to my goal.
LINE 95: The Lord.
LINE 96: As long as on the earth he lives
LINE 97: Thou hast my license full and free;
LINE 98: Man still must stumble while he strives.
LINE 99: Mephistopheles.
LINE 100: My thanks for that! the dead for me
LINE 101: Have little charm; my humor seeks
LINE 102: The bloom of lusty life, with plump and rosy cheeks;
LINE 103: For a vile corpse my tooth is far too nice,
LINE 104: I do just as the cat does with the mice.
LINE 105: The Lord.
LINE 106: So be it; meanwhile, to tempt him thou are free;
LINE 107: Go, drag this spirit from his native fount,
LINE 108: And lead him on, canst thou his will surmount,
LINE 109: Into perdition down with thee;
LINE 110: But stand ashamed at last, when thou shalt see
LINE 111: An honest man, 'mid all his strivings dark,
LINE 112: Finds the right way, though lit but by a spark.
LINE 113: Mephistopheles.
LINE 114: Well, well; short time will show; into my net
LINE 115: I'll draw the fish, and then I've won my bet;
LINE 116: And when I've carried through my measure
LINE 117: Loud blast of trump shall blaze my glory;
LINE 118: Dust shall he eat, and that with pleasure,
LINE 119: Like my cousin the snake in the rare old story.
LINE 120: The Lord.
LINE 121: And thou mayst show thee here in upper sky
LINE 122: Unhindered, when thou hast a mind;
LINE 123: I never hated much thee or thy kind;
LINE 124: Of all the spirits that deny,
LINE 125: The clever rogue sins least against my mind.
LINE 126: For, in good sooth, the mortal generation,
LINE 127: When a soft pillow they may haply find,
LINE 128: Are far too apt to sink into stagnation;
LINE 129: And therefore man for comrade wisely gets
LINE 130: A devil, who spurs, and stimulates, and whets.
LINE 131: But you, ye sons of heaven's own choice,
LINE 132: In the one living Beautiful rejoice!
LINE 133: The self-evolving Energy divine
LINE 134: Enclasp you round with love's embrace benign,
LINE 135: And on the floating forms of earth and sky
LINE 136: Stamp the fair type of thought that may not die.
LINE 137: Mephistopheles.
LINE 138: From time to time the ancient gentleman
LINE 139: I see, and keep on the best terms I can.
LINE 140: In a great Lord 'tis surely wondrous civil
LINE 141: So face to face to hold talk with the devil.
LINE 142: FAUST.
