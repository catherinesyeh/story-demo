LINE 1: Scene I.
LINE 2: _Before the gate of the town._
LINE 3: _Motley groups of people crowding out to walk._
LINE 4: Some Journeymen.
LINE 5: Brethren, whither bound?
LINE 6: Others.
LINE 7: To the JÃ¦gerhaus.
LINE 8: The First.
LINE 9: We to the mill.
LINE 10: A Journeyman.
LINE 11: At Wasserhof best cheer is to be found.
LINE 12: A Second.
LINE 13: But then the road is not agreeable.
LINE 14: The Others.
LINE 15: And what dost thou?
LINE 16: A Third.
LINE 17: I go where others go.
LINE 18: A Fourth.
LINE 19: Let's go to Burgdorf; there you'll find, I know,
LINE 20: The best of beer, and maidens to your mind,
LINE 21: And roaring frolics too, if that's your kind.
LINE 22: A Fifth.
LINE 23: Thou over-wanton losel, thou!
LINE 24: Dost itch again for some new row?
LINE 25: I loathe the place; and who goes thither,
LINE 26: He and I don't go together.
LINE 27: A Servant Girl.
LINE 28: No! no! back to the town I'd rather fare.
LINE 29: Another.
LINE 30: We're sure to find him 'neath the poplars there.
LINE 31: The First.
LINE 32: No mighty matter that for me,
LINE 33: Since he will walk with none but thee,
LINE 34: In every dance, too, he is thine:
LINE 35: What have thy joys to do with mine?
LINE 36: The Other.
LINE 37: To-day he'll not come single; sure he said
LINE 38: That he would bring with him the curly-head.
LINE 39: Student.
LINE 40: Blitz, how the buxom wenches do their paces!
LINE 41: Come, let us make acquaintance with their faces.
LINE 42: A stiff tobacco, and a good strong beer,
LINE 43: And a fine girl well-rigged, that's the true Burschen cheer!
LINE 44: Burghers' Daughters.
LINE 45: Look only at those spruce young fellows there!
LINE 46: In sooth, 'tis more than one can bear;
LINE 47: The best society have they, if they please,
LINE 48: And run after such low-bred queans as these!
LINE 49: Second Student. [_to the first_]
LINE 50: Not quite so fast! there comes a pair behind,
LINE 51: So smug and trim, so blithe and debonair;
LINE 52: And one is my fair neighbor, I declare;
LINE 53: She is a girl quite to my mind.
LINE 54: They pass along so proper and so shy,
LINE 55: And yet they'll take us with them by and by.
LINE 56: First Student.
LINE 57: No, no! these girls with nice conceits they bore you,
LINE 58: Have at the open game that lies before you!
LINE 59: The hand that plies the busy broom on Monday,
LINE 60: Caressed her love the sweetest on the Sunday.
LINE 61: A Burgher.
LINE 62: No! this new burgomaster don't please me,
LINE 63: Now that he's made, his pride mounts high and higher;
LINE 64: And for the town, say, what does he?
LINE 65: Are we not deep and deeper in the mire?
LINE 66: In strictness day by day he waxes,
LINE 67: And more than ever lays on taxes.
LINE 68: A Beggar. [_singing_]
LINE 69: Ye gentle sirs, and ladies fair,
LINE 70: With clothes so fine, and cheeks so red,
LINE 71: O pass not by, but from your eye
LINE 72: Be pity's gracious virtue shed!
LINE 73: Let me not harp in vain; for blest
LINE 74: Is he alone who gives away;
LINE 75: And may this merry Easter-feast
LINE 76: Be for the poor no fasting day!
LINE 77: Another Burgher.
LINE 78: Upon a Sunday or a holiday,
LINE 79: No better talk I know than war and warlike rumors,
LINE 80: When in Turkey far away,
LINE 81: The nations fight out their ill humors.
LINE 82: We sit i' the window, sip our glass at ease,
LINE 83: And see how down the stream the gay ships gently glide;
LINE 84: Then wend us safely home at even-tide,
LINE 85: Blessing our stars we live in times of peace.
LINE 86: Third Burgher.
LINE 87: Yea, neighbor, there you speak right wisely;
LINE 88: Ev'n so do I opine precisely.
LINE 89: They may split their skulls, they may,
LINE 90: And turn the world upside down,
LINE 91: So long as we, in our good town,
LINE 92: Keep jogging in the good old way.
LINE 93: Old Woman. [_to the Burghers' Daughters._]
LINE 94: Hey-day, how fine! these be of gentle stuff,
LINE 95: The eyes that would not look on you are blind.
LINE 96: Only not quite so high! 'Tis well enough--
LINE 97: And what you wish I think I know to find.
LINE 98: First Burgher's Daughter.
LINE 99: Agatha, come! I choose not to be seen
LINE 100: With such old hags upon the public green;
LINE 101: Though on St. Andrew's night she let me see
LINE 102: My future lover bodily.
LINE 103: Second Burgher's Daughter.
LINE 104: Mine too, bold, soldier-like, she made to pass,
LINE 105: With his wild mates, before me in a glass;
LINE 106: I hunt him out from place to place,
LINE 107: But nowhere yet he shows his face.
LINE 108: Soldiers.
LINE 109: Castles and turrets
LINE 110: And battlements high,
LINE 111: Maids with proud spirits,
LINE 112: And looks that defy!
LINE 113: From the red throat of death,
LINE 114: With the spear and the glaive,
LINE 115: We pluck the ripe glory
LINE 116: That blooms for the brave.
LINE 117: The trumpet invites him,
LINE 118: With soul-stirring call,
LINE 119: To where joy delights him,
LINE 120: Nor terrors appall.
LINE 121: On storming maintains he
LINE 122: Triumphant the field,
LINE 123: Strong fortresses gains he,
LINE 124: Proud maidens must yield.
LINE 125: Thus carries the soldier
LINE 126: The prize of the day,
LINE 127: And merrily, merrily
LINE 128: Dashes away!
LINE 129: Scene II.
LINE 130: _Enter_ /Faust/ _and_ /Wagner/.
LINE 131: Faust.
LINE 132: The ice is now melted from stream and brook
LINE 133: By the Spring's genial life-giving look;
LINE 134: Forth smiles young Hope in the greening vale,
LINE 135: And ancient Winter, feeble and frail,
LINE 136: Creeps cowering back to the mountains grey;
LINE 137: And thence he sends, as he hies him away,
LINE 138: Fitfullest brushes of icy hail,
LINE 139: Sweeping the plain in his harmless flight.
LINE 140: But the sun may brook no white,
LINE 141: Everywhere stirs he the vegetive strife,
LINE 142: Flushing the fields with the glow of life;
LINE 143: But since few flowers yet deck the mead
LINE 144: He takes him gay-dressed folk in their stead.
LINE 145: Now from these heights I turn me back
LINE 146: To view the city's busy track.
LINE 147: Through the dark, deep-throated gate
LINE 148: They are pouring and spreading in motley array.
LINE 149: All sun themselves so blithe to-day.
LINE 150: The Lord's resurrection they celebrate,
LINE 151: For that themselves to life are arisen.
LINE 152: From lowly dwellings' murky prison,
LINE 153: From labor and business' fetters tight,
LINE 154: From the press of gables and roofs that meet
LINE 155: Over the squeezing narrow street,
LINE 156: From the churches' solemn night
LINE 157: Have they all been brought to the light.
LINE 158: Lo! how nimbly the multitude
LINE 159: Through the fields and the gardens hurry,
LINE 160: How, in its breadth and length, the flood
LINE 161: Wafts onward many a gleesome wherry,
LINE 162: And this last skiff moves from the brink
LINE 163: So laden that it seems to sink.
LINE 164: Ev'n from the far hills' winding way
LINE 165: I' the sunshine glitter their garments gay.
LINE 166: I hear the hamlet's noisy mirth;
LINE 167: Here is the people's heaven on earth,
LINE 168: And great and small rejoice to-day.
LINE 169: Here may I be a man, here dare
LINE 170: The joys of men with men to share.
LINE 171: Wagner.
LINE 172: With you, Herr Doctor, one is proud to walk,
LINE 173: Sharing your fame, improving by your talk;
LINE 174: But, for myself, I shun the multitude,
LINE 175: Being a foe to everything that's rude.
LINE 176: I may not brook their senseless howling,
LINE 177: Their fiddling, screaming, ninepin bowling;
LINE 178: Like men possessed, they rave along,
LINE 179: And call it joy, and call it song.
LINE 180: Scene III.
LINE 181: Peasants. [_beneath a lime-tree_]
LINE 182: The shepherd for the dance was dressed,
LINE 183: With ribbon, wreath, and spotted vest,
LINE 184: Right sprucely he did show.
LINE 185: And round and round the linden-tree
LINE 186: All danced as mad as mad could be.
LINE 187: Juchhe, juchhe!
LINE 188: Juchheisa, heisa, he!
LINE 189: So went the fiddle bow.
LINE 190: Then with a jerk he wheeled him by,
LINE 191: And on a maiden that stood nigh
LINE 192: He with his elbow came.
LINE 193: Quick turned the wench, and, "Sir," quoth she,
LINE 194: "Such game is rather rough for me."
LINE 195: Juchhe, juchhe!
LINE 196: Juchheisa, heisa, he!
LINE 197: "For shame, I say, for shame!"
LINE 198: Yet merrily went it round and round,
LINE 199: And right and left they swept the ground,
LINE 200: And coat and kirtle flew;
LINE 201: And they grew red, and they grew warm,
LINE 202: And, panting, rested arm in arm;
LINE 203: Juchhe, juchhe!
LINE 204: Juchheisa, heisa, he!
LINE 205: And hips on elbows too.
LINE 206: And "Softly, softly," quoth the quean,
LINE 207: "How many a bride hath cheated been
LINE 208: By men as fair as you!"
LINE 209: But he spoke a word in her ear aside,
LINE 210: And from the tree it shouted wide
LINE 211: Juchhe, juchhe!
LINE 212: Juchheisa, heisa, he!
LINE 213: With fife and fiddle too.
LINE 214: An Old Peasant.
LINE 215: Herr Doctor, 'tis most kind in you,
LINE 216: And all here prize the boon, I'm sure,
LINE 217: That one so learned should condescend
LINE 218: To share the pastimes of the poor.
LINE 219: Here, take this pitcher, filled ev'n now
LINE 220: With cooling water from the spring.
LINE 221: May God with grace to slake your thirst,
LINE 222: Bless the libation that we bring;
LINE 223: Be every drop a day to increase
LINE 224: Your years in happiness and peace!
LINE 225: Faust.
LINE 226: Your welcome offering I receive; the draught
LINE 227: By kind hands given, with grateful heart be quaffed!
LINE 228: [_The people collect round him in a circle._
LINE 229: Old Peasant.
LINE 230: Soothly, Herr Doctor, on this tide,
LINE 231: Your grace and kindness passes praise;
LINE 232: Good cause had we whileome to bless
LINE 233: The name of Faust in evil days.
LINE 234: Here stand there not a few whose lives
LINE 235: Your father's pious care attest,
LINE 236: Saved from fell fever's rage, when he
LINE 237: Set limits to the deadly pest.
LINE 238: You were a young man then, and went
LINE 239: From hospital to hospital;
LINE 240: Full many a corpse they bore away,
LINE 241: But you came scaithless back from all;
LINE 242: Full many a test severe you stood
LINE 243: Helping helped by the Father of Good.
LINE 244: All the Peasants.
LINE 245: Long may the man who saved us live,
LINE 246: His aid in future need to give!
LINE 247: Faust.
LINE 248: Give thanks to Him above, who made
LINE 249: The hand that helped you strong to aid.
LINE 250: [_He goes on farther with_ /Wagner/.
LINE 251: Wagner.
LINE 252: How proud must thou not feel, most learnÃ¨d man,
LINE 253: To hear the praises of this multitude;
LINE 254: Thrice happy he who from his talents can
LINE 255: Reap such fair harvest of untainted good!
LINE 256: The father shows you to his son,
LINE 257: And all in crowds to see you run;
LINE 258: The dancers cease their giddy round,
LINE 259: The fiddle stops its gleesome sound;
LINE 260: They form a ring where'er you go,
LINE 261: And in the air their caps they throw;
LINE 262: A little more, and they would bend the knee,
LINE 263: As if the Holy Host came by in thee!
LINE 264: Faust.
LINE 265: Yet a few paces, till we reach yon stone,
LINE 266: And there our wearied strength we may repair.
LINE 267: Here oft I sat in moody thought alone,
LINE 268: And vexed my soul with fasting and with prayer.
LINE 269: Rich then in hope, in faith then strong,
LINE 270: With tears and sobs my hands I wrung,
LINE 271: And weened the end of that dire pest,
LINE 272: From heaven's high-counselled lord to wrest.
LINE 273: Now their applause with mockery flouts mine ear.
LINE 274: O could'st thou ope my heart and read it here,
LINE 275: How little sire and son
LINE 276: For such huge meed of thanks have done!
LINE 277: My father was a grave old gentleman,
LINE 278: Who o'er the holy secrets of creation,
LINE 279: Sincere, but after his peculiar plan,
LINE 280: Brooded, with whimsied speculation.
LINE 281: Who, with adepts in painful gropings spent
LINE 282: His days, within the smoky kitchen pent,
LINE 283: And, after recipes unnumbered, made
LINE 284: The unnatural mixtures of his trade.
LINE 285: The tender lily and the lion red,
LINE 286: A suitor bold, in tepid bath were wed,
LINE 287: With open fiery flame well baked together,
LINE 288: And squeezed from one bride-chamber to another;
LINE 289: Then, when the glass the queen discovered,
LINE 290: Arrayed in youthful glistening pride,
LINE 291: Here was the medicine, and the patient died,
LINE 292: But no one questioned who recovered.
LINE 293: Thus in these peaceful vales and hills,
LINE 294: The plague was not the worst of ills,
LINE 295: And Death his ghastly work pursued,
LINE 296: The better for the hellish brewst we brewed.
LINE 297: Myself to thousands the curst juice supplied;
LINE 298: They pined away, and I must live to hear
LINE 299: The praise of mercy in the murderer's ear.
LINE 300: Wagner.
LINE 301: How can you with such whims be grieved?
LINE 302: Surely a good man does his part
LINE 303: With scrupulous care to use the art
LINE 304: Which from his father he received.
LINE 305: When we, in youth, place on our sire reliance,
LINE 306: He opes to us his stores of information;
LINE 307: When we, as men, extend the bounds of science,
LINE 308: Our sons build higher upon our foundation.
LINE 309: Faust.
LINE 310: O happy he who yet hath hope to float
LINE 311: Above this sea of crude distempered thought!
LINE 312: What we know not is what we need to know,
LINE 313: And what we know, we might as well let go;
LINE 314: But cease; cheat not the moment of its right
LINE 315: By curious care and envious repining;
LINE 316: Behold how fair, in evening's mellow light,
LINE 317: The green-embosomed cottages are shining.
LINE 318: The sun slants down, the day hath lived his date,
LINE 319: But on he hies to tend another sphere.
LINE 320: O that no wing upon my wish may wait
LINE 321: To follow still and still in his career!
LINE 322: Upborne on evening's quenchless beams to greet
LINE 323: The noiseless world illumined at my feet,
LINE 324: Each peaceful vale, each crimson-flaming peak,
LINE 325: Each silver rill whose tinkling waters seek
LINE 326: The golden flood that feeds the fruitful plain.
LINE 327: Then savage crags, and gorges dark, would rein
LINE 328: My proud careering course in vain;
LINE 329: Ev'n now the sea spreads out its shimmering bays,
LINE 330: And charms the sense with ectasy of gaze.
LINE 331: Yet seems the god at length to sink;
LINE 332: But, borne by this new impulse of my mind,
LINE 333: I hasten on, his quenchless ray to drink,
LINE 334: The day before me, and the night behind,
LINE 335: The heavens above me, under me the sea.
LINE 336: A lovely dream! meanwhile the god is gone.
LINE 337: Alas! the soul, in wingÃ¨d fancy free,
LINE 338: Seeks for a corporal wing, and findeth none.
LINE 339: Yet in each breast 'tis deeply graven,
LINE 340: Upward and onward still to pant,
LINE 341: When over us, lost in the blue of heaven,
LINE 342: Her quavering song the lark doth chaunt;
LINE 343: When over piny peaks sublime
LINE 344: The eagle soars with easy strain,
LINE 345: And over lands and seas the crane
LINE 346: Steers homeward to a sunnier clime.
LINE 347: Wagner.
LINE 348: I too have had my hours of whim,
LINE 349: But feeling here runs over reason's brim.
LINE 350: Forest and field soon tire the eye to scan,
LINE 351: And eagle's wings were never made for man.
LINE 352: How otherwise the mind and its delights!
LINE 353: From book to book, from page to page, we go.
LINE 354: Thus sweeten we the dreary winter nights,
LINE 355: Till every limb with new life is aglow;
LINE 356: And chance we but unroll some rare old parchment scroll,
LINE 357: All heaven stoops down, and finds a lodgment in the soul.
LINE 358: Faust.
LINE 359: Thou know'st but the one impulse--it is well!
LINE 360: Tempt not the yearning that divides the heart.
LINE 361: Two souls, alas! within my bosom dwell!
LINE 362: This strives from that with adverse strain to part.
LINE 363: The one, bound fast by stubborn might of love,
LINE 364: To this low earth with grappling organs clings;
LINE 365: The other spurns the clod, and soars on wings
LINE 366: To join a nobler ancestry above.
LINE 367: Oh! be there spirits in the air,
LINE 368: 'Twixt earth and heaven that float with potent sway,
LINE 369: Drop from your sphere of golden-glowing day,
LINE 370: And waft me hence new varied life to share!
LINE 371: Might I but own a mantle's fold enchanted,
LINE 372: To climes remote to bear me on its wing,
LINE 373: More than the costliest raiment I should vaunt it,
LINE 374: More than the purple robe that clothes a king.
LINE 375: Wagner.
LINE 376: Invoke not rash the well-known spirit-throng,
LINE 377: That stream unseen the atmosphere along,
LINE 378: And dangers thousandfold prepare,
LINE 379: Weak men from every quarter to ensnare.
LINE 380: From the keen north in troops they float,
LINE 381: With sharpest teeth and arrow-pointed tongues;
LINE 382: From the harsh east they bring a blasting drought,
LINE 383: And feed with wasting greed upon thy lungs.
LINE 384: When from the arid south their sultry powers
LINE 385: They send, hot fires upheaping on thy crown,
LINE 386: The West brings forth his swarms with cooling showers,
LINE 387: To end in floods that sweep thy harvests down.
LINE 388: Quick-ear'd are they, on wanton mischief bent,
LINE 389: And work our will with surer bait to ply us;
LINE 390: They show as fair as heaven's own couriers sent,
LINE 391: And lisp like angels when they most belie us.
LINE 392: But let us hence! the air is chill,
LINE 393: The cold gray mists are creeping down the hill,
LINE 394: Now is the time to seek the bright fireside.
LINE 395: Why standest thou with strange eyes opened wide?
LINE 396: What twilight-spectre may thy fancy trouble?
LINE 397: Faust.
LINE 398: See'st thou that swarthy dog sweeping through corn and stubble?
LINE 399: Wagner.
LINE 400: I saw him long ago--not strange he seemed to me.
LINE 401: Faust.
LINE 402: Look at him well--what should the creature be?
LINE 403: Wagner.
LINE 404: He seems a poodle who employs his snout
LINE 405: Now here, now there, to snuff his master out.
LINE 406: Faust.
LINE 407: Dost thou not see how nigher still and nigher
LINE 408: His spiral circles round us wind?
LINE 409: And, err I not, he leaves behind
LINE 410: His track a train of sparkling fire.
LINE 411: Wagner.
LINE 412: A small black poodle is all I see;
LINE 413: Surely some strange delusion blinds thee!
LINE 414: Faust.
LINE 415: Methinks soft magic circles winds he,
LINE 416: About, about, a snare for thee and me.
LINE 417: Wagner.
LINE 418: I see him only doubtful springing round,
LINE 419: Having two strangers for his master found.
LINE 420: Faust.
LINE 421: He draws him closer--now he comes quite near!
LINE 422: Wagner.
LINE 423: A dog, be sure, and not a ghost, is here.
LINE 424: He growls, and looks about in fear,
LINE 425: And crouches down, and looks to you,
LINE 426: And wags his tail--what any dog will do.
LINE 427: Faust.
LINE 428: Come hither, poodle!
LINE 429: Wagner.
LINE 430: 'Tis a drollish brute;
LINE 431: When you stand still, then stands he mute,
LINE 432: But when you speak, he springs as he would speak to you;
LINE 433: He will bring back what you let fall,
LINE 434: And fetch your stick out of the water.
LINE 435: Faust.
LINE 436: You are quite right. There's no such matter.
LINE 437: No trace of ghost--a dog well trained, that's all!
LINE 438: Wagner.
LINE 439: A well-trained dog may well engage
LINE 440: The favor of a man most sage;
LINE 441: This poodle well deserves your recognition;
LINE 442: Few students learn so much from good tuition.
LINE 443: [_Exeunt, going in through the gate of the city._
LINE 444: Scene IV.
LINE 445: /Faust's/ _Study._
LINE 446: Faust. [_entering with the_ /Poodle/.]
LINE 447: Now field and meadow lie behind me,
LINE 448: Hushed 'neath the veil of deepest night,
LINE 449: And thoughts of solemn seeming find me,
LINE 450: Too holy for the garish light.
LINE 451: Calm now the blood that wildly ran,
LINE 452: Asleep the hand of lawless strife;
LINE 453: Now wakes to life the love of man,
LINE 454: The love of God now wakes to life.
LINE 455: Cease, poodle! why snuff'st and snifflest thou so,
LINE 456: Running restless to and fro?
LINE 457: Behind the stove there lie at rest,
LINE 458: And take for bed my cushion the best!
LINE 459: And as without, on our mountain-ramble,
LINE 460: We joyed to see thy freakish gambol,
LINE 461: So here, my hospitable care,
LINE 462: A quiet guest, and welcome share.
LINE 463: When in our narrow cell confined,
LINE 464: The friendly lamp begins to burn,
LINE 465: Then clearer sees the thoughtful mind,
LINE 466: With searching looks that inward turn.
LINE 467: Bright Hope again within us beams,
LINE 468: And Reason's voice again is strong,
LINE 469: We thirst for life's untroubled streams,
LINE 470: For the pure fount of life we long.
LINE 471: Quiet thee, poodle! it seems not well
LINE 472: To break, with thy growling, the holy spell
LINE 473: Of my soul's music, that refuses
LINE 474: All fellowship with bestial uses.
LINE 475: Full well we know that the human brood,
LINE 476: What they don't understand condemn,
LINE 477: And murmur in their peevish mood
LINE 478: At things too fair and good for them;
LINE 479: Belike the cur, as curs are they,
LINE 480: Thus growls and snarls his bliss away.
LINE 481: But, alas! already I feel it well,
LINE 482: No more may peace within this bosom dwell.
LINE 483: Why must the stream so soon dry up,
LINE 484: And I lie panting for the cup
LINE 485: That mocks my lips? so often why
LINE 486: Drink pleasure's shallow fount, when scarce yet tasted, dry?
LINE 487: Yet is this evil not without remeid;
LINE 488: We long for heavenly food to feed
LINE 489: Our heaven-born spirit, and the heart, now bent
LINE 490: On things divine, to revelation turns,
LINE 491: Which nowhere worthier or purer burns,
LINE 492: Than here in our New Testament.
LINE 493: I feel strange impulse in my soul
LINE 494: The sacred volume to unroll,
LINE 495: With honest purpose, once for all,
LINE 496: The holy Greek Original
LINE 497: Into my honest German to translate.
LINE 498: [_He opens the Bible and reads._]
LINE 499: "In the beginning was the /Word/:" thus here
LINE 500: The text stands written; but no clear
LINE 501: Meaning shines here for me, and I must wait,
LINE 502: A beggar at dark mystery's gate,
LINE 503: Lamed in the start of my career.
LINE 504: The naked word I dare not prize so high,
LINE 505: I must translate it differently,
LINE 506: If by the Spirit I am rightly taught.
LINE 507: "In the beginning of all things was /Thought/."
LINE 508: The first line let me ponder well,
LINE 509: Lest my pen outstrip my sense;
LINE 510: Is it Thought wherein doth dwell
LINE 511: All-creative omnipotence?
LINE 512: I change the phrase, and write--the course
LINE 513: Of the great stream of things was shaped by /Force/.
LINE 514: But even here, before I lift my pen,
LINE 515: A voice of warning bids me try again.
LINE 516: At length, at length, the Spirit helps my need,
LINE 517: I write--"In the beginning was the /Deed/."
LINE 518: Wilt thou keep thy dainty berth,
LINE 519: Poodle, use a gentler mirth,
LINE 520: Cease thy whimpering and howling,
LINE 521: And keep for other place thy growling.
LINE 522: Such a noisy inmate may
LINE 523: Not my studious leisure cumber;
LINE 524: You or I, without delay,
LINE 525: Restless cur, must leave the chamber!
LINE 526: Not willingly from thee I take
LINE 527: The right of hospitality.
LINE 528: But if thou wilt my quiet break,
LINE 529: Seek other quarters--thou hast exit free.
LINE 530: But what must I see?
LINE 531: What vision strange
LINE 532: Beyond the powers
LINE 533: Of Nature's range?
LINE 534: Am I awake, or bound with a spell?
LINE 535: How wondrously the brute doth swell!
LINE 536: Long and broad
LINE 537: Uprises he,
LINE 538: In a form that no form
LINE 539: Of a dog may be!
LINE 540: What spectre brought I into the house?
LINE 541: He stands already, with glaring eyes,
LINE 542: And teeth in grinning ranks that rise,
LINE 543: Large as a hippopotamus!
LINE 544: O! I have thee now!
LINE 545: For such half-brood of hell as thou
LINE 546: The key of Solomon the wise
LINE 547: Is surest spell to exorcise.[*n3]
LINE 548: Spirits. [_in the passage without_]
LINE 549: Brother spirits, have a care!
LINE 550: One within is prisoned there!
LINE 551: Follow him none!--for he doth quail
LINE 552: Like a fox, trap-caught by the tail.
LINE 553: But let us watch!
LINE 554: Hover here, hover there,
LINE 555: Up and down amid the air;
LINE 556: For soon this sly old lynx of hell
LINE 557: Will tear him free, and all be well.
LINE 558: If we can by foul or fair,
LINE 559: We will free him from the snare,
LINE 560: And repay good service thus,
LINE 561: Done by him oft-times for us.
LINE 562: Faust.
LINE 563: First let the charm of the elements four
LINE 564: The nature of the brute explore.
LINE 565: Let the Salamander glow,
LINE 566: Undene twine her crested wave,
LINE 567: Silphe into ether flow,
LINE 568: And Kobold vex him, drudging slave![*n4]
LINE 569: Whoso knows not
LINE 570: The elements four,
LINE 571: Their quality,
LINE 572: And hidden power,
LINE 573: In the magic art
LINE 574: Hath he no part.
LINE 575: Spiring in flames glow
LINE 576: Salamander!
LINE 577: Rushing in waves flow
LINE 578: Undene!
LINE 579: Shine forth in meteor-beauty
LINE 580: Silphe!
LINE 581: Work thy domestic duty
LINE 582: Incubus Incubus!
LINE 583: Step forth and finish the spell.
LINE 584: None of the four
LINE 585: In the brute doth dwell.
LINE 586: It lies quite still with elfish grinning there.
LINE 587: It shall know a stronger charm,
LINE 588: It shall shrink from sharper harm,
LINE 589: When by a mightier name I swear.
LINE 590: Art thou a fugitive
LINE 591: Urchin of hell?
LINE 592: So yield thee at length
LINE 593: To this holiest spell!
LINE 594: Bend thee this sacred
LINE 595: Emblem before,
LINE 596: Which the powers of darkness
LINE 597: Trembling adore.[*n5]
LINE 598: Already swells he up with bristling hair.
LINE 599: Can'st thou read it,
LINE 600: The holy sign,
LINE 601: Reprobate spirit,
LINE 602: The emblem divine?
LINE 603: The unbegotten,
LINE 604: Whom none can name,
LINE 605: Moving and moulding
LINE 606: The wide world's frame,
LINE 607: Yet nailed to the cross
LINE 608: With a death of shame.
LINE 609: Now behind the stove he lies,
LINE 610: And swells him up to an elephant's size,
LINE 611: And fills up all the space.
LINE 612: He'll melt into a cloud; not so!
LINE 613: Down, I say, down, proud imp, and know
LINE 614: Here, at thy master's feet, thy place!
LINE 615: In vain, in vain, thou seek'st to turn thee,
LINE 616: With an holy flame I burn thee!
LINE 617: Wait not the charm
LINE 618: Of the triple-glowing light!
LINE 619: Beware the harm
LINE 620: If thou invite
LINE 621: Upon thy head my spell of strongest might!
LINE 622: [_The clouds vanish, and_ /Mephistopheles/ _comes forward from behind
LINE 623: the fireplace, dressed like an itinerant scholar._
LINE 624: Scene V.
LINE 625: /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.
LINE 626: Mephistopheles.
LINE 627: What's all the noise about? I'm here at leisure
LINE 628: To work your worship's will and pleasure.
LINE 629: Faust.
LINE 630: So, so! such kernel cracked from such a shell!
LINE 631: A travelling scholar! the jest likes me well!
LINE 632: Mephistopheles.
LINE 633: I greet the learned gentleman!
LINE 634: I've got a proper sweating 'neath your ban.
LINE 635: Faust.
LINE 636: What is thy name?
LINE 637: Mephistopheles.
LINE 638: What is my power were better,
LINE 639: From one who so despises the mere letter,
LINE 640: Who piercing through the coarse material shell,
LINE 641: With Being's inmost substance loves to dwell.
LINE 642: Faust.
LINE 643: Yes, but you gentlemen proclaim
LINE 644: Your nature mostly in your name;
LINE 645: Destroyer, God of Flies, the Adversary,[*1]
LINE 646: Such names their own interpretation carry.
LINE 647: But say, who art thou?
LINE 648: Mephistopheles.
LINE 649: I am a part of that primordial Might,
LINE 650: Which always wills the wrong, and always works the right.
LINE 651: Faust.
LINE 652: You speak in riddles; the interpretation?
LINE 653: Mephistopheles.
LINE 654: I am the Spirit of Negation:
LINE 655: And justly so; for all that is created
LINE 656: Deserves to be annihilated.
LINE 657: 'Twere better, thus, that there were no creation.
LINE 658: Thus everything that you call evil,
LINE 659: Destruction, ruin, death, the devil,
LINE 660: Is my pure element and sphere.
LINE 661: Faust.
LINE 662: Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet standest wholly here.
LINE 663: Mephistopheles.
LINE 664: I speak to thee the truth exact,
LINE 665: The plain, unvarnished, naked fact,
LINE 666: Though man, that microcosm of folly deems
LINE 667: Himself the compact whole he seems.
LINE 668: Part of the part I am that erst was all,
LINE 669: Part of the darkness, from whose primal pall
LINE 670: Was born the light, the proud rebellious Light,
LINE 671: Which now disputeth with its mother Night,
LINE 672: Her rank and room i' the world by ancient right.
LINE 673: Yet vainly; though it strain and struggle much,
LINE 674: 'Tis bound to body with the closer clutch;
LINE 675: From body it streams, on body paints a hue,
LINE 676: And body bends it from its course direct;
LINE 677: Thus in due season I expect,
LINE 678: When bodies perish, Light will perish too.
LINE 679: Faust.
LINE 680: Hold! now I know thy worthy duties all!
LINE 681: Unable to annihilate wholesale,
LINE 682: Thy mischief now thou workest by retail.
LINE 683: Mephistopheles.
LINE 684: And even thus, my progress is but small.
LINE 685: This something, the big lumpish world, which stands
LINE 686: Opposed to nothing, still ties my hands,
LINE 687: And spite of all the ground that I seem winning,
LINE 688: Remains as firm as in the beginning;
LINE 689: With storms and tempests, earthquakes and burnings,
LINE 690: Earth still enjoys its evenings and mornings,
LINE 691: And the accursÃ¨d fry of brute and human clay,
LINE 692: On them my noblest skill seems worse than thrown away.
LINE 693: How many thousands have I not buried!
LINE 694: Yet still a new fresh blood is hurried
LINE 695: Through fresh young veins, that I must sheer despair.
LINE 696: The earth, the water, and the air,
LINE 697: The moist, the dry, the hot, the cold,
LINE 698: A thousand germs of life unfold;
LINE 699: And had I not of flame made reservation,
LINE 700: I had no portion left in the creation.
LINE 701: Faust.
LINE 702: And thus thou seekest to oppose
LINE 703: The genial power, from which all life and motion flows,
LINE 704: Against Existence' universal chain,
LINE 705: Clenching thy icy devil's fist in vain!
LINE 706: Try some more profitable feats,
LINE 707: Strange son of Chaos, full of cross conceits.
LINE 708: Mephistopheles.
LINE 709: The hint is good, and on occasion,
LINE 710: May well deserve consideration;
LINE 711: Meanwhile, with your good leave, I would withdraw.
LINE 712: Faust.
LINE 713: My leave! do I make devil's law?
LINE 714: The liberty, methinks, is all your own.
LINE 715: I see you here to-day with pleasure,
LINE 716: Go now, and come back at your leisure.
LINE 717: Here is the door, there is the window, and
LINE 718: A chimney, if you choose it, is at hand.
LINE 719: Mephistopheles.
LINE 720: Let me speak plain! there is a small affair,
LINE 721: That, without your assistance, bars my way,
LINE 722: The goblin-foot upon the threshold there--
LINE 723: Faust.
LINE 724: The pentagram stands in your way![*n6]
LINE 725: Ha! tell me then, thou imp of sin,
LINE 726: If this be such a potent spell
LINE 727: To bar thy going out, how cam'st thou in?
LINE 728: What could have cheated such a son of hell?
LINE 729: Mephistopheles.
LINE 730: Look at it well, the drawing is not true;
LINE 731: One angle, that towards the door, you see,
LINE 732: Left a small opening for me.
LINE 733: Faust.
LINE 734: So so! for once dame Fortune has been kind,
LINE 735: And I have made a prisoner of you!
LINE 736: Chance is not always blind.
LINE 737: Mephistopheles.
LINE 738: The cur sprang in before it looked about;
LINE 739: But now the thing puts on a serious air;
LINE 740: The devil is in the house and can't get out.
LINE 741: Faust.
LINE 742: You have the window, why not jump out there?
LINE 743: Mephistopheles.
LINE 744: It is a law which binds all ghosts and sprites;
LINE 745: Wherever they creep in, there too they must creep out;
LINE 746: I came in at the door, by the door I must go out.
LINE 747: Faust.
LINE 748: So so! then hell too has its laws and rights,
LINE 749: Thus might one profit by the powers of evil,
LINE 750: And make an honest bargain with the devil.
LINE 751: Mephistopheles.
LINE 752: The devil, sir, makes no undue exaction,
LINE 753: And pays what he has promised to a fraction;
LINE 754: But this affair requires consideration,
LINE 755: We'll leave it for some future conversation.
LINE 756: For this time, I beseech your grace,
LINE 757: Let me be gone; I've work to do.
LINE 758: Faust.
LINE 759: Stay but one minute, I've scarce seen your face.
LINE 760: Speak; you should know the newest of the new.
LINE 761: Mephistopheles.
LINE 762: I'll answer thee at length some other day;
LINE 763: At present, I beseech thee, let me loose.
LINE 764: Faust.
LINE 765: I laid no trap to snare thee in the way,
LINE 766: Thyself didst thrust thy head into the noose;
LINE 767: Whoso hath caught the devil, hold him fast!
LINE 768: Such lucky chance returns not soon again.
LINE 769: Mephistopheles.
LINE 770: If 'tis your pleasure so, I will remain,
LINE 771: But on condition that the time be passed
LINE 772: In worthy wise, and you consent to see
LINE 773: Some cunning sleights of spirit-craft from me.
LINE 774: Faust.
LINE 775: Thy fancy jumps with mine. Thou may'st commence,
LINE 776: So that thy dainty tricks but please the sense.
LINE 777: Mephistopheles.
LINE 778: Thou shalt, in this one hour, my friend,
LINE 779: More for thy noblest senses gain,
LINE 780: Than in the year's dull formal train,
LINE 781: From stale beginning to stale end.
LINE 782: The songs the gentle Spirits sing thee,
LINE 783: The lovely visions that they bring thee,
LINE 784: Are not an empty juggling show.
LINE 785: On thine ear sweet sounds shall fall,
LINE 786: Odorous breezes round thee blow,
LINE 787: Taste, and touch, and senses all
LINE 788: With delicious tingling glow.
LINE 789: No lengthened prelude need we here,
LINE 790: Sing, Spirit-imps that hover near!
LINE 791: Spirits.
LINE 792: Vanish ye murky
LINE 793: Old arches away!
LINE 794: Through the cloud curtain
LINE 795: That blinds heaven's ray
LINE 796: Mild and serenely
LINE 797: Look forth the queenly
LINE 798: Eye of the day!
LINE 799: Star now and starlet
LINE 800: Beam more benign,
LINE 801: And purer suns now
LINE 802: Softlier shine.
LINE 803: In beauty ethereal,
LINE 804: A swift-moving throng,
LINE 805: Of spirits aÃ«rial,
LINE 806: Are waving along,
LINE 807: And the soul follows
LINE 808: On wings of desire;
LINE 809: The fluttering garlands
LINE 810: That deck their attire,
LINE 811: Cover the meadows,
LINE 812: Cover the bowers,
LINE 813: Where lovers with lovers
LINE 814: Breathe rapturous hours.
LINE 815: Bower on bower!
LINE 816: The shoots of the vine,
LINE 817: With the leaves of the fig-tree,
LINE 818: Their tendrils entwine!
LINE 819: Clusters of ripe grapes,
LINE 820: Bright-blushing all,
LINE 821: Into the wine-press
LINE 822: Heavily fall;
LINE 823: From fountains divine
LINE 824: Bright rivers of wine
LINE 825: Come foaming and swirling;
LINE 826: O'er gems of the purest,
LINE 827: Sparkling and purling,
LINE 828: They flow and they broaden
LINE 829: In bright vista seen,
LINE 830: To deep-bosomed lakes
LINE 831: Lightly fringed with the green,
LINE 832: Where leafy woods nod
LINE 833: In their tremulous sheen.
LINE 834: On light-oaring pinions
LINE 835: The birds cut the gale,
LINE 836: Through the breezy dominions
LINE 837: As sunward they sail;
LINE 838: They sail on swift wings
LINE 839: To the isles of the blest,
LINE 840: On the soft swelling waves
LINE 841: That are cradled to rest;
LINE 842: Where we hear the glad spirits
LINE 843: In jubilee sing,
LINE 844: As o'er the green meadows
LINE 845: Fleet-bounding they spring:
LINE 846: With light airy footing,
LINE 847: A numberless throng,
LINE 848: Like meteors shooting
LINE 849: The mountains along;
LINE 850: Some there are flinging
LINE 851: Their breasts to the seas,
LINE 852: Others are swinging
LINE 853: In undulant ease,
LINE 854: Lovingly twining
LINE 855: Life's tissue divine,
LINE 856: Where pure stars are shining
LINE 857: In beauty benign!
LINE 858: Mephistopheles.
LINE 859: He sleeps! well done, ye airy urchins! I
LINE 860: Remain your debtor for this lullaby,
LINE 861: By which so bravely ye have sung asleep
LINE 862: This restless spirit, who, with all his wit,
LINE 863: Is not yet quite the man with cunning cast,
LINE 864: To hook the devil and hold him fast.
LINE 865: Around him let your shapes fantastic flit,
LINE 866: And in a sea of dreams his senses steep.
LINE 867: But now this threshold's charm to disenchant,
LINE 868: The tooth of a rat is all I want;
LINE 869: Nor need I make a lengthened conjuration,
LINE 870: I hear one scraping there in preparation.
LINE 871: The lord of the rats and of the mice,
LINE 872: Of the flies, and frogs, and bugs, and lice,
LINE 873: Commands you with your teeth's good saw,
LINE 874: The threshold of this door to gnaw!
LINE 875: Forth come, and there begin to file,
LINE 876: Where he lets fall this drop of oil.
LINE 877: Ha! there he jumps! that angle there,
LINE 878: With thy sharp teeth I bid thee tear,
LINE 879: Which jutting forward, sad disaster,
LINE 880: Unwilling prisoner keeps thy master.
LINE 881: Briskly let the work go on,
LINE 882: One bite more and it is done! [_Exit._
LINE 883: Faust. [_awakening from his trance_]
LINE 884: Once more the juggler Pleasure cheats my lip,
LINE 885: Gone the bright spirit-dream, and left no trace,
LINE 886: That I spake with the devil face to face,
LINE 887: And that a poodle dog gave me the slip!
LINE 888: Scene VI.
LINE 889: /Faust's/ _Study as before._
LINE 890: /Faust. Mephistopheles./
LINE 891: Faust.
LINE 892: Who's there to break my peace once more? come in!
LINE 893: Mephistopheles.
LINE 894: 'Tis I!
LINE 895: Faust.
LINE 896: Come in!
LINE 897: Mephistopheles.
LINE 898: Thou must repeat it thrice.
LINE 899: Faust.
LINE 900: Come in.
LINE 901: Mephistopheles.
LINE 902: Thus with good omen we begin;
LINE 903: I come to give you good advice,
LINE 904: And hope we'll understand each other.
LINE 905: The idle fancies to expel,
LINE 906: That in your brain make such a pother,
LINE 907: At your service behold me here,
LINE 908: Of noble blood, a cavalier,
LINE 909: A gallant youth rigged out with grace,
LINE 910: In scarlet coat with golden lace,
LINE 911: A short silk mantle, and a bonnet,
LINE 912: With a gay cock's feather on it,
LINE 913: And at my side a long sharp sword.
LINE 914: Now listen to a well-meant word;
LINE 915: Do thou the like, and follow me,
LINE 916: All unembarrassed thus and free,
LINE 917: To mingle in the busy scenes
LINE 918: Of life, and know what living means.
LINE 919: Faust.
LINE 920: Still must I suffer, clothe me as you may,
LINE 921: This narrow earthly life's incumbrancy;
LINE 922: Too old I am to be content with play,
LINE 923: Too young from every longing to be free.
LINE 924: What can the world hold forth for me to gain?
LINE 925: Abstain, it saith, and still it saith, Abstain!
LINE 926: This is the burden of the song
LINE 927: That in our ears eternal rings,
LINE 928: Life's dreary litany lean and long,
LINE 929: That each dull moment hoarsely sings.
LINE 930: With terror wake I in the morn from sleep,
LINE 931: And bitter tears might often weep,
LINE 932: To see the day, when its dull course is run,
LINE 933: That brings to fruit not one small wish,--not one!
LINE 934: That, with capricious criticising,
LINE 935: Each taste of joy within my bosom rising,
LINE 936: Ere it be born, destroys, and in my breast
LINE 937: Chokes every thought that gives existence zest,
LINE 938: With thousand soulless trifles of an hour.
LINE 939: And when the dark night-shadows lower,
LINE 940: I seek to ease my aching brain
LINE 941: Upon a weary couch in vain.
LINE 942: With throngs of feverish dreams possessed,
LINE 943: Even in the home of sleep I find no rest;
LINE 944: The god, that in my bosom dwells,
LINE 945: Can stir my being's inmost wells;
LINE 946: But he who sways supreme our finer stuff,
LINE 947: Moves not the outward world, hard, obdurate, and tough.
LINE 948: Thus my existence is a load of woes,
LINE 949: Death my best friend, and life my worst of foes.
LINE 950: Mephistopheles.
LINE 951: And yet methinks this friend you call your best,
LINE 952: Is seldom, when he comes, a welcome guest.
LINE 953: Faust.
LINE 954: Oh! happy he to whom, in victory's glance,
LINE 955: Death round his brow the bloody laurel winds!
LINE 956: Whom, 'mid the circling hurry of the dance,
LINE 957: Locked in a maiden's close embrace he finds;
LINE 958: O! would to God that I had sunk that night
LINE 959: In tranceful death before the Spirit's might!
LINE 960: Mephistopheles.
LINE 961: Yet, on a certain night, a certain man was slow
LINE 962: To drink a certain brown potation out.
LINE 963: Faust.
LINE 964: It seems 'tis your delight to play the scout.
LINE 965: Mephistopheles.
LINE 966: Omniscient am I not; but many things I know.
LINE 967: Faust.
LINE 968: If, in that moment's wild confusion,
LINE 969: A well-known tone of blithesome youth
LINE 970: Had power, by memory's dear delusion,
LINE 971: To cheat me with the guise of truth;
LINE 972: Then curse I all whate'er the soul
LINE 973: With luring juggleries entwines,
LINE 974: And in this gloomy dungeon-hole
LINE 975: With dazzling flatteries confines!
LINE 976: Curst be 'fore all the high opinion
LINE 977: The soul has of its own dominion!
LINE 978: Curst all the show of shallow seeming,
LINE 979: Through gates of sense fallacious streaming!
LINE 980: Curst be the hollow dreams of fame,
LINE 981: Of honor, glory, and a name!
LINE 982: Curst be the flattering goods of earth,
LINE 983: Wife, child, and servant, house and hearth!
LINE 984: Accursed be Mammon, when with treasures
LINE 985: To riskful venture he invites us,
LINE 986: Curst when, the slaves of passive pleasures,
LINE 987: On soft-spread cushions he delights us!
LINE 988: Curst be the balsam juice o' the grape!
LINE 989: Accursed be love's deceitful thrall!
LINE 990: Accursed be Hope! accursed be Faith!
LINE 991: Accursed be Patience above all!
LINE 992: Chorus of Spirits. [_invisible_]
LINE 993: Woe! woe!
LINE 994: Thou hast destroyed it!
LINE 995: The beautiful world,
LINE 996: With mightiest hand,
LINE 997: A demigod
LINE 998: In ruin has hurled!
LINE 999: We weep,
LINE 1000: And bear its wrecked beauty away,
LINE 1001: Whence it may never
LINE 1002: Return to the day.
LINE 1003: Mightiest one
LINE 1004: Of the sons of earth,
LINE 1005: Brightest one,
LINE 1006: Build it again!
LINE 1007: Proudly resurgent with lovelier birth
LINE 1008: In thine own bosom build it again!
LINE 1009: Life's glad career
LINE 1010: Anew commence
LINE 1011: With insight clear,
LINE 1012: And purgÃ¨d sense,
LINE 1013: The while new songs around thee play,
LINE 1014: To launch thee on more hopeful way!
LINE 1015: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1016: These are the tiny
LINE 1017: Spirits that wait on me;
LINE 1018: Hark how to pleasure
LINE 1019: And action they counsel thee!
LINE 1020: Into the world wide
LINE 1021: Would they allure thee,
LINE 1022: In solitude dull
LINE 1023: No more to immure thee,
LINE 1024: No more to sit moping
LINE 1025: In mouldy mood,
LINE 1026: With a film on thy sense,
LINE 1027: And a frost in thy blood!
LINE 1028: Cease then with thine own peevish whim to play,
LINE 1029: That like a vulture makes thy life its prey.
LINE 1030: Society, however low,
LINE 1031: Still gives thee cause to feel and know
LINE 1032: Thyself a man, amid thy fellow-men.
LINE 1033: Yet my intent is not to pen
LINE 1034: Thee up with the common herd! and though
LINE 1035: I cannot boast, or rank, or birth
LINE 1036: Of mighty men, the lords of earth,
LINE 1037: Yet do I offer, at thy side,
LINE 1038: Thy steps through mazy life to guide;
LINE 1039: And, wilt thou join in this adventure,
LINE 1040: I bind myself by strong indenture,
LINE 1041: Here, on the spot, with thee to go.
LINE 1042: Call me companion, comrade brave,
LINE 1043: Or, if it better please thee so,
LINE 1044: I am thy servant, am thy slave!
LINE 1045: Faust.
LINE 1046: And in return, say, what the fee
LINE 1047: Thy faithful service claims from me?
LINE 1048: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1049: Of that you may consider when you list.
LINE 1050: Faust.
LINE 1051: No, no! the devil is an Egotist,
LINE 1052: And seldom gratis sells his labor,
LINE 1053: For love of God, to serve his neighbor.
LINE 1054: Speak boldly out, no private clause conceal;
LINE 1055: With such as you 'tis dangerous to deal.
LINE 1056: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1057: I bind myself to be thy servant here,
LINE 1058: And wait with sleepless eyes upon thy pleasure,
LINE 1059: If, when we meet again in _yonder_ sphere,
LINE 1060: Thou wilt repay my service in like measure.
LINE 1061: Faust.
LINE 1062: What _yonder_ is I little reck to know,
LINE 1063: Provided I be happy here below;
LINE 1064: The future world will soon enough arise,
LINE 1065: When the present in ruin lies.
LINE 1066: 'Tis from this earth my stream of pleasure flows,
LINE 1067: This sun it is that shines upon my woes;
LINE 1068: And, were I once from this my home away,
LINE 1069: Then happen freely what happen may.
LINE 1070: Nor hope in me it moves, nor fear,
LINE 1071: If then, as now, we hate and love;
LINE 1072: Or if in yonder world, as here,
LINE 1073: An under be, and an above.
LINE 1074: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1075: Well, in this humor, you bid fair
LINE 1076: With hope of good result to dare.
LINE 1077: Close with my plan, and you will see
LINE 1078: Anon such pleasant tricks from me,
LINE 1079: As never eyes of man did bliss
LINE 1080: From father Adam's time to this.
LINE 1081: Faust.
LINE 1082: Poor devil, what hast thou to give,
LINE 1083: By which a human soul may live?
LINE 1084: By thee or thine was never yet divined
LINE 1085: The thought that stirs the deep heart of mankind!
LINE 1086: True, thou hast food that sateth never,
LINE 1087: And yellow gold that, restless ever,
LINE 1088: Like quicksilver between the fingers,
LINE 1089: Only to escape us, lingers;
LINE 1090: A game where we are sure to lose our labor,
LINE 1091: A maiden that, while hanging on my breast,
LINE 1092: Flings looks of stolen dalliance on my neighbor;
LINE 1093: And honor by which gods are blest,
LINE 1094: That, like a meteor, vanishes in air.
LINE 1095: Show me the fruit that rots _before_ 'tis broken,
LINE 1096: And trees that day by day their green repair!
LINE 1097: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1098: A word of mighty meaning thou hast spoken,
LINE 1099: Yet such commission makes not me despair.
LINE 1100: Believe me, friend, we only need to try it,
LINE 1101: And we too may enjoy our morsel sweet in quiet.
LINE 1102: Faust.
LINE 1103: If ever on a couch of soft repose
LINE 1104: My soul shall rock at ease,
LINE 1105: If thou canst teach with sweet delusive shows
LINE 1106: Myself myself to please,
LINE 1107: If thou canst trick me with a toy
LINE 1108: To say sincerely I /enjoy/,
LINE 1109: Then may my latest sand be run!
LINE 1110: A wager on it!
LINE 1111: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1112: Done!
LINE 1113: Faust.
LINE 1114: And done, and done!
LINE 1115: When to the moment I shall say,
LINE 1116: Stay, thou art so lovely, stay!
LINE 1117: Then with thy fetters bind me round,
LINE 1118: Then perish I with cheerful glee!
LINE 1119: Then may the knell of death resound,
LINE 1120: Then from thy service art thou free!
LINE 1121: The clock may stand,
LINE 1122: And the falling hand
LINE 1123: Mark the time no more for me!
LINE 1124: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1125: Consider well: in things like these
LINE 1126: The devil's memory is not apt to slip.
LINE 1127: Faust.
LINE 1128: That I know well; may'st keep thy heart at ease,
LINE 1129: No random word hath wandered o'er my lip.
LINE 1130: Slave I remain, or here, or there,
LINE 1131: Thine, or another's, I little care.
LINE 1132: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1133: My duty I'll commence without delay,
LINE 1134: When with the graduates you dine to-day.
LINE 1135: One thing remains!--black upon white
LINE 1136: A line or two, to make the bargain tight.
LINE 1137: Faust.
LINE 1138: A writing, pedant!--hast thou never found
LINE 1139: A man whose word was better than his bond?
LINE 1140: Is't not enough that by my spoken word,
LINE 1141: Of all I am and shall be thou art lord?
LINE 1142: The world drives on, wild wave engulfing wave,
LINE 1143: And shall a line bind me, if I would be a knave?
LINE 1144: Yet 'tis a whim deep-graven in the heart,
LINE 1145: And from such fancies who would gladly part?
LINE 1146: Happy within whose honest breast concealed
LINE 1147: There lives a faith, nor time nor chance can shake;
LINE 1148: Yet still a parchment, written, stamped, and sealed,
LINE 1149: A spectre is before which all must quake.
LINE 1150: Commit but once thy word to the goose-feather,
LINE 1151: Then must thou yield the sway to wax and leather.
LINE 1152: Say, devil--paper, parchment, stone, or brass?
LINE 1153: With me this coin or that will pass;
LINE 1154: Style, or chisel, or pen shall it be?
LINE 1155: Thou hast thy choice of all the three.
LINE 1156: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1157: What need of such a hasty flare
LINE 1158: Of words about so paltry an affair?
LINE 1159: Paper or parchment, any scrap will do,
LINE 1160: Then write in blood your signature thereto.
LINE 1161: Faust.
LINE 1162: If this be all, there needs but small delay,
LINE 1163: Such trifles shall not stand long in my way.
LINE 1164: Mephistopheles. [_while Faust is signing the paper_]
LINE 1165: Blood is a juice of most peculiar virtue.
LINE 1166: Faust.
LINE 1167: Only no fear that I shall e'er demur to
LINE 1168: The bond as signed; my whole heart swears
LINE 1169: Even to the letter that the parchment bears.
LINE 1170: Too high hath soared my blown ambition;
LINE 1171: I now take rank with thy condition;
LINE 1172: The Mighty Spirit of All hath scorned me,
LINE 1173: And Nature from her secrets spurned me:
LINE 1174: My thread of thought is rent in twain,
LINE 1175: All science I loathe with its wranglings vain.
LINE 1176: In the depths of sensual joy, let us tame
LINE 1177: Our glowing passion's restless flame!
LINE 1178: In magic veil, from unseen hand,
LINE 1179: Be wonders ever at our command!
LINE 1180: Plunge we into the rush of Time!
LINE 1181: Into Action's rolling main!
LINE 1182: Then let pleasure and pain,
LINE 1183: Loss and gain,
LINE 1184: Joy and sorrow, alternate chime!
LINE 1185: Let bright suns shine, or dark clouds lower,
LINE 1186: The man that works is master of the hour.
LINE 1187: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1188: To thee I set nor bound nor measure,
LINE 1189: Every dainty thou may'st snatch,
LINE 1190: Every flying joy may'st catch,
LINE 1191: Drink deep, and drain each cup of pleasure;
LINE 1192: Only have courage, friend, and be not shy!
LINE 1193: Faust.
LINE 1194: Content from thee thy proper wares to buy,
LINE 1195: Thou markest well, I do not speak of joy,
LINE 1196: Pleasure that smarts, giddy intoxication,
LINE 1197: Enamoured hate, and stimulant vexation.
LINE 1198: My bosom healed from hungry greed of science
LINE 1199: With every human pang shall court alliance;
LINE 1200: What all mankind of pain and of enjoyment
LINE 1201: May taste, with them to taste be my employment;
LINE 1202: Their deepest and their highest I will sound,
LINE 1203: Want when they want, be filled when they abound,
LINE 1204: My proper self unto their self extend,
LINE 1205: And with them too be wrecked, and ruined in the end.
LINE 1206: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1207: Believe thou me, who speak from test severe,
LINE 1208: Chewing the same hard food from year to year,
LINE 1209: There lives (were but the naked truth confessed)
LINE 1210: No man who, from his cradle to his bier,
LINE 1211: The same sour leaven can digest!
LINE 1212: Trust one of us--this universe so bright,
LINE 1213: He made it only for his own delight;
LINE 1214: Supreme He reigns, in endless glory shining,
LINE 1215: To utter darkness me and mine consigning,
LINE 1216: And grudges ev'n to you the day without the night.
LINE 1217: Faust.
LINE 1218: But I will!
LINE 1219: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1220: There you are right!
LINE 1221: One thing alone gives me concern,
LINE 1222: The time is short, and we have much to learn.
LINE 1223: There is a way, if you would know it,
LINE 1224: Just take into your pay a poet;
LINE 1225: Then let the learned gentleman sweep
LINE 1226: Through the wide realms of imagination
LINE 1227: And every noble qualification,
LINE 1228: Upon your honored crown upheap,
LINE 1229: The strength of the lion,
LINE 1230: The wild deer's agility,
LINE 1231: The fire of the south,
LINE 1232: With the north's durability.
LINE 1233: Then let his invention the secret unfold,
LINE 1234: To be crafty and cunning, yet generous and bold;
LINE 1235: And teach your youthful blood, as poets can,
LINE 1236: To fall in love according to a plan.
LINE 1237: Myself have a shrewd notion where we might
LINE 1238: Enlist a cunning craftsman of this nature,
LINE 1239: And Mr. Microcosmus he is hight.
LINE 1240: Faust.
LINE 1241: What am I then, if still I strive in vain
LINE 1242: To reach the crown of manhood's perfect stature,
LINE 1243: The goal for which with all my life of life I strain?
LINE 1244: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1245: Thou art, do what thou wilt, just what thou art.
LINE 1246: Heap wigs on wigs by millions on thy head,
LINE 1247: And upon yard-high buskins tread,
LINE 1248: Still thou remainest simply what thou art.
LINE 1249: Faust.
LINE 1250: I feel it well, in vain have I uphoarded
LINE 1251: All treasures that the mind of man afforded,
LINE 1252: And when I sit me down, I feel no more
LINE 1253: A well of life within me than before;
LINE 1254: Not ev'n one hairbreadth greater is my height,
LINE 1255: Not one inch nearer to the infinite.
LINE 1256: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1257: My worthy friend, these things you view,
LINE 1258: Just as they appear to you;
LINE 1259: Some wiser method we must shape us,
LINE 1260: Ere the joys of life escape us.
LINE 1261: Why, what the devil! hands and feet,
LINE 1262: Brain and brawn and blood are thine;
LINE 1263: And what I drink, and what I eat,
LINE 1264: Whose can it be, if 'tis not mine?
LINE 1265: If I can number twice three horses,
LINE 1266: Are not their muscles mine? and when I'm mounted,
LINE 1267: I feel myself a man, and wheel my courses,
LINE 1268: Just as if four-and-twenty legs I counted.
LINE 1269: Quick then! have done with reverie,
LINE 1270: And dash into the world with me!
LINE 1271: I tell thee plain, a speculating fellow
LINE 1272: Is like an ox on heath all brown and yellow,
LINE 1273: Led in a circle by an evil spirit,
LINE 1274: With roods of lush green pasture smiling near it.
LINE 1275: Faust.
LINE 1276: But how shall we commence?
LINE 1277: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1278: We start this minute:
LINE 1279: Why, what a place of torture is here,
LINE 1280: And what a life you live within it!
LINE 1281: Yourself and your pack of younkers dear,
LINE 1282: Killing outright with ennui!
LINE 1283: Leave that to honest neighbor Paunch!
LINE 1284: Thrashing of straw is not for thee:
LINE 1285: Besides, into the best of all your knowledge,
LINE 1286: You know 'tis not permitted you to launch
LINE 1287: With chicken-hearted boys at College.
LINE 1288: Ev'n now, methinks, I hear one on the stair.
LINE 1289: Faust.
LINE 1290: Send him away: I cannot bear--
LINE 1291: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1292: Poor boy! he's waited long, nor must depart
LINE 1293: Without some friendly word for head and heart;
LINE 1294: Come, let me slip into your gown; the mask
LINE 1295: Will suit me well; as for the teaching task,
LINE 1296: [_He puts on_ /Faust's/ _scholastic robes._]
LINE 1297: Leave that to me! I only ask
LINE 1298: A quarter of an hour; and you make speed
LINE 1299: And have all ready for our journey's need. [_Exit._
LINE 1300: Mephistopheles. [_solus_]
LINE 1301: Continue thus to hold at nought
LINE 1302: Man's highest power, his power of thought;
LINE 1303: Thus let the Father of all lies
LINE 1304: With shows of magic blind thine eyes,
LINE 1305: And thou art mine, a certain prize.
LINE 1306: To him hath Fate a spirit given,
LINE 1307: With reinless impulse ever forwards driven,
LINE 1308: Whose hasty striving overskips
LINE 1309: The joys that flow for mortal lips;
LINE 1310: Him drag I on through life's wild chase,
LINE 1311: Through flat unmeaning emptiness;
LINE 1312: He shall cling and cleave to me,
LINE 1313: Like a sprawling child in agony,
LINE 1314: And food and drink, illusive hovering nigh,
LINE 1315: Shall shun his parchÃ¨d lips, and cheat his longing eye;
LINE 1316: He shall pine and pant and strain
LINE 1317: For the thing he may not gain,
LINE 1318: And, though he ne'er had sold him to do evil,
LINE 1319: He would have damned himself without help from the devil.
LINE 1320: Scene VII.
LINE 1321: _Enter a_ /Student/.
LINE 1322: Student.
LINE 1323: I am but fresh arrived to-day,
LINE 1324: And come my best respects to pay,
LINE 1325: To one whose name, from boor to Kaiser,
LINE 1326: None, without veneration, mention.
LINE 1327: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1328: I feel obliged by your attention!
LINE 1329: You see a man than other men no wiser:
LINE 1330: Have you made inquiry elsewhere?
LINE 1331: Student.
LINE 1332: Beseech you, sir, be my adviser!
LINE 1333: I come with money to spend and spare,
LINE 1334: With fresh young blood, and a merry heart,
LINE 1335: On my college career to start:
LINE 1336: My mother sent me, not without a tear,
LINE 1337: To get some needful schooling here.
LINE 1338: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1339: A better place you could not find.
LINE 1340: Student.
LINE 1341: To speak the truth, 'tis not much to my mind.
LINE 1342: Within these narrow cloister walls,
LINE 1343: These antiquated Gothic halls,
LINE 1344: I feel myself but ill at ease;
LINE 1345: No spot of green I see, no trees,
LINE 1346: And 'mid your formal rows of benches,
LINE 1347: I almost seem to lose my senses.
LINE 1348: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1349: That all depends on custom. Don't you see
LINE 1350: How a young babe at first is slow
LINE 1351: To know its mother's breast; but soon
LINE 1352: With joy it strains the milky boon;
LINE 1353: So you anon will suck nutrition
LINE 1354: From Wisdom's breasts with blest fruition.
LINE 1355: Student.
LINE 1356: I yearn to do so even now;
LINE 1357: But, in the first place, tell me how?
LINE 1358: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1359: My help is yours, or great or small;
LINE 1360: But choose your Faculty, first of all.
LINE 1361: Student.
LINE 1362: I aim at culture, learning, all
LINE 1363: That men call science on the ball
LINE 1364: Of earth, or in the starry tent
LINE 1365: Of heaven; all Nature high and low,
LINE 1366: Broad and deep, I seek to know.
LINE 1367: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1368: There you are on the proper scent;
LINE 1369: Only beware of too much distraction.
LINE 1370: Student.
LINE 1371: With soul and body I'm girt for action,
LINE 1372: And yet I cannot choose but praise
LINE 1373: A little freedom and merriment,
LINE 1374: On pleasant summer holidays.
LINE 1375: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1376: Redeem the time, for fast it fleets away,
LINE 1377: But order rules the hour it cannot stay.
LINE 1378: Therefore 'tis plain that you must pass
LINE 1379: First of all through the logic class.
LINE 1380: There will your mind be postured rightly,
LINE 1381: Laced up in Spanish buskins tightly,
LINE 1382: That with caution and care, as wisdom ought,
LINE 1383: It may creep along the path of thought,
LINE 1384: And not with fitful flickering glow
LINE 1385: Will o' the wisp it to and fro.
LINE 1386: There, too, if you hear the gentleman through
LINE 1387: The term, to every lecture true,
LINE 1388: You'll learn that a stroke of human thinking,
LINE 1389: Which you had practised once as free
LINE 1390: And natural as eating and drinking,
LINE 1391: Cannot be made without one! two! three!
LINE 1392: True, it should seem that the tissue of thought
LINE 1393: Is like a web by cunning master wrought,
LINE 1394: Where one stroke moves a thousand threads,
LINE 1395: The shuttle shoots backwards and forwards between,
LINE 1396: The slender threads flow together unseen,
LINE 1397: And one with the others thousand-fold weds:
LINE 1398: Then steps the philosopher forth to show
LINE 1399: How of necessity it must be so:
LINE 1400: If the first be so, the second is so,
LINE 1401: And therefore the third and the fourth is so;
LINE 1402: And unless the first and the second before be,
LINE 1403: The third and the fourth can never more be.
LINE 1404: So schoolmen teach and scholars believe,
LINE 1405: But none of them yet ever learned to weave.
LINE 1406: He who strives to know a thing well
LINE 1407: Must first the spirit within expel,
LINE 1408: Then can he count the parts in his hand,
LINE 1409: Only without the spiritual band.
LINE 1410: _Encheiresis naturÃ¦_, 'tis clept in Chemistry,
LINE 1411: Thus laughing at herself, albeit she knows not why.
LINE 1412: Student.
LINE 1413: I must confess I can't quite comprehend you.
LINE 1414: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1415: In this respect time by and by will mend you,
LINE 1416: When you have learned the crude mixed masses
LINE 1417: To decompose, and rank them in their classes.
LINE 1418: Student.
LINE 1419: I feel as stupid to all he has said,
LINE 1420: As a mill-wheel were whirling round in my head.
LINE 1421: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1422: After logic, first of all,
LINE 1423: To the study of metaphysics fall!
LINE 1424: There strive to know what ne'er was made
LINE 1425: To go into a human head;
LINE 1426: For what is within and without its command
LINE 1427: A high-sounding word is always at hand.
LINE 1428: But chiefly, for the first half year,
LINE 1429: Let order in all your studies appear;
LINE 1430: Five lectures a-day, that no time be lost,
LINE 1431: And with the clock be at your post!
LINE 1432: Come not, as some, without preparation,
LINE 1433: But con his paragraphs o'er and o'er,
LINE 1434: To be able to say, when you hear his oration,
LINE 1435: That he gives you his book, and nothing more;
LINE 1436: Yet not the less take down his words in writing,
LINE 1437: As if the Holy Spirit were inditing!
LINE 1438: Student.
LINE 1439: I shall not quickly give you cause
LINE 1440: To repeat so weighty a clause;
LINE 1441: For what with black on white is written,
LINE 1442: We carry it home, a sure possession.
LINE 1443: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1444: But, as I said, you must choose a profession.
LINE 1445: Student.
LINE 1446: With Law, I must confess, I never was much smitten.
LINE 1447: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1448: I should be loath to force your inclination,
LINE 1449: Myself have some small skill in legislation;
LINE 1450: For human laws and rights from sire to son,
LINE 1451: Like an hereditary ill, flow on;
LINE 1452: From generation dragged to generation,
LINE 1453: And creeping slow from place to place.
LINE 1454: Reason is changed to nonsense, good to evil,
LINE 1455: Art thou a grandson, woe betide thy case!
LINE 1456: Of Law they prate, most falsely clept the Civil,
LINE 1457: But for that right, which from our birth we carry,
LINE 1458: 'Tis not a word found in their Dictionary.
LINE 1459: Student.
LINE 1460: Your words have much increased my detestation.
LINE 1461: O happy he, to whom such guide points out the way!
LINE 1462: And now, I almost feel an inclination
LINE 1463: To give Theology the sway.
LINE 1464: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1465: I have no wish to lead you astray.
LINE 1466: As to this science, 'tis so hard to eschew
LINE 1467: The false way, and to hit upon the true,
LINE 1468: And so much hidden poison lurks within,
LINE 1469: That's scarce distinguished from the medicine.
LINE 1470: Methinks that here 'twere safest done
LINE 1471: That you should listen but to one,
LINE 1472: And _jurare in verba magistri_
LINE 1473: Is the best maxim to assist thee.
LINE 1474: Upon the whole, I counsel thee
LINE 1475: To stick to words as much as may be,
LINE 1476: For such will still the surest way be
LINE 1477: Into the temple of certainty.
LINE 1478: Student.
LINE 1479: Yet in a word some sense must surely lurk.
LINE 1480: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1481: Yes, but one must not go too curiously to work;
LINE 1482: For, just when our ideas fail us,
LINE 1483: A well-coined word may best avail us.
LINE 1484: Words are best weapons in disputing,
LINE 1485: In system-building and uprooting,
LINE 1486: To words most men will swear, though mean they ne'er so little,
LINE 1487: From words one cannot filch a single tittle.
LINE 1488: Student.
LINE 1489: Pardon me, if I trespass on your time,
LINE 1490: Though to make wisdom speak seems scarce a crime;
LINE 1491: On medicine, too, I am concerned
LINE 1492: To hear some pregnant word from one so learned.
LINE 1493: Three years, God knows, is a short time,
LINE 1494: And we have far to go, and high to climb;
LINE 1495: A wise man's fingers pointing to the goal
LINE 1496: Will save full many a groan to many a laboring soul.
LINE 1497: Mephistopheles. [_aside_]
LINE 1498: I'm weary of this dry pedantic strain,
LINE 1499: 'Tis time to play the genuine devil again.
LINE 1500: [_Aloud._] The spirit of Medicine 'tis not hard to seize:
LINE 1501: The world, both great and small, you seek to know,
LINE 1502: That in the end you may let all things go
LINE 1503: As God shall please.
LINE 1504: In vain you range around with scientific eyes,
LINE 1505: Each one at length learns only what he can;
LINE 1506: But he who knows the passing hour to prize,
LINE 1507: That is the proper man.
LINE 1508: A goodly shape and mien you vaunt,
LINE 1509: And confidence, I guess, is not your want,
LINE 1510: Trust but yourself, and, without more ado,
LINE 1511: All other men will straightway trust you too.
LINE 1512: But chiefly be intent to get a hold
LINE 1513: O' the women's minds: their endless Oh! and Ah!
LINE 1514: So thousandfold,
LINE 1515: In all its change, obeys a single law,
LINE 1516: And, if with half a modest air you come,
LINE 1517: You have them all beneath your thumb.
LINE 1518: A title first must purchase their reliance,
LINE 1519: That you have skill surpassing vulgar science;
LINE 1520: Thus have you hold at once of all the seven ends,
LINE 1521: Round which another year of labor spends.
LINE 1522: Study to press the pulse right tenderly,
LINE 1523: And, with a sly and fiery eye,
LINE 1524: To hold her freely round the slender waist,
LINE 1525: That you may see how tightly she is laced.
LINE 1526: Student.
LINE 1527: This seems to promise better; here we see
LINE 1528: Where to apply and how to use the knife.
LINE 1529: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1530: Gray, my good friend, is every theory,
LINE 1531: But green the golden tree of life.
LINE 1532: Student.
LINE 1533: I vow I feel as in a dream; my brain
LINE 1534: Contains much more than it can comprehend;
LINE 1535: Some other day may I come back again,
LINE 1536: To hear your wisdom to the end?
LINE 1537: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1538: What I can teach all men are free to know.
LINE 1539: Student.
LINE 1540: One little favor grant me ere I go;
LINE 1541: It were my boast to take home on this page
LINE 1542: [_Presenting a leaf from his album._]
LINE 1543: Some sapient maxim from a man so sage.
LINE 1544: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1545: Right willingly.
LINE 1546: [_He writes, and gives back the book._
LINE 1547: Student. [_reads_]
LINE 1548: _Eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum._
LINE 1549: [_He closes the book reverently, and takes his leave._
LINE 1550: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1551: Follow the ancient saw, and my cousin, the famous old Serpent,
LINE 1552: Right soon shalt thou have cause, at thy godlike knowledge to
LINE 1553: tremble!
LINE 1554: _Enter_ /Faust/.
LINE 1555: Faust.
LINE 1556: Now, whither bound?
LINE 1557: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1558: Where'er it pleases you;
LINE 1559: The world, both great and small, we view.
LINE 1560: O! how it will delight, entrance you,
LINE 1561: The merry reel of life to dance through!
LINE 1562: Faust.
LINE 1563: My beard, I am afraid, is rather long;
LINE 1564: And without easy manners, gentle breeding,
LINE 1565: I fear there is small chance of my succeeding;
LINE 1566: I feel so awkward 'mid the busy throng,
LINE 1567: So powerless and so insignificant,
LINE 1568: And what all others have I seem to want.
LINE 1569: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1570: Bah! never fear; the simple art of living
LINE 1571: Is just to live right on without misgiving!
LINE 1572: Faust.
LINE 1573: But how shall we commence our course?
LINE 1574: I see nor coach, nor groom, nor horse.
LINE 1575: Mephistopheles.
LINE 1576: We only need your mantle to unfold,
LINE 1577: And it shall waft us on the wind.
LINE 1578: Who makes with me this journey bold
LINE 1579: No bulky bundle busks behind;
LINE 1580: A single puff of inflammable air,
LINE 1581: And from the ground we nimbly fare.
LINE 1582: Lightly we float. I wish the best of cheer
LINE 1583: To Doctor Faustus on his new career.
LINE 1584: /end of act second/.
