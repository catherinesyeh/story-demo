LINE 1: /Manager/ of a Strolling Company.--/Stage-poet/--/Merryfellow/.
LINE 2: Manager.
LINE 3: Ye twain, in good and evil day
LINE 4: So oft my solace and my stay,
LINE 5: Say, have ye heard sure word, or wandering rumor
LINE 6: How our new scheme affects the public humor?
LINE 7: Without the multitude we cannot thrive,
LINE 8: Their maxim is to live and to let live.
LINE 9: The posts are up, the planks are fastened, and
LINE 10: Each man's agog for something gay and grand.
LINE 11: With arched eyebrows they sit already there,
LINE 12: Gaping for something new to make them stare.
LINE 13: I know the public taste, and profit by it;
LINE 14: But still to-day I've fears of our succeeding:
LINE 15: 'Tis true they're customed to no dainty diet,
LINE 16: But they've gone through an awful breadth of reading.
LINE 17: How shall we make our pieces fresh and new,
LINE 18: And with some meaning in them, pleasing too?
LINE 19: In sooth, I like to see the people pouring
LINE 20: Into our booth, like storm and tempest roaring,
LINE 21: While, as the waving impulse onward heaves them,
LINE 22: The narrow gate of grace at length receives them,
LINE 23: When, long ere it be dark, with lusty knocks
LINE 24: They fight their way on to the money-box,
LINE 25: And like a starving crowd around a baker's door,
LINE 26: For tickets as for bread they roar.
LINE 27: So wonder-working is the poet's sway
LINE 28: O'er every heart--so may it work to-day!
LINE 29: Poet.
LINE 30: O mention not that motley throng to me,
LINE 31: Which only seen makes frighted genius pause;
LINE 32: Hide from my view that wild and whirling sea
LINE 33: That sucks me in, and deep and downward draws.
LINE 34: No! let some noiseless nook of refuge be
LINE 35: My heaven, remote from boisterous rude applause,
LINE 36: Where Love and Friendship, as a God inspires,
LINE 37: Create and fan the pure heart's chastened fires.
LINE 38: Alas! what there the shaping thought did rear,
LINE 39: And scarce the trembling lip might lisping say,
LINE 40: To Nature's rounded type not always near,
LINE 41: The greedy moment rudely sweeps away.
LINE 42: Oft-times a work, through many a patient year
LINE 43: Must toil to reach its finished fair display;
LINE 44: The glittering gaud may fix the passing gaze,
LINE 45: But the pure gem gains Time's enduring praise.
LINE 46: Merryfellow.
LINE 47: Pshaw! Time will reap his own; but in our power
LINE 48: The moment lies, and we must use the hour.
LINE 49: The Future, no doubt, is the Present's heir,
LINE 50: But we who live must first enjoy our share.
LINE 51: Methinks the present of a goodly boy
LINE 52: Has something that the wisest might enjoy.
LINE 53: Whose ready lips with easy lightness brim,
LINE 54: The people's humor need not trouble him;
LINE 55: He courts a crowd the surer to impart
LINE 56: The quickening word that stirs the kindred heart.
LINE 57: Quit ye like men, be honest bards and true,
LINE 58: Let Fancy with her many-sounding chorus,
LINE 59: Reason, Sense, Feeling, Passion, move before us,
LINE 60: But, mark me well--a spice of folly too!
LINE 61: Manager.
LINE 62: Give what you please, so that you give but plenty;
LINE 63: They come to see, and you must feed their eyes;
LINE 64: Scene upon scene, each act may have its twenty,
LINE 65: To keep them gaping still in fresh surprise:
LINE 66: This is the royal road to public favor;
LINE 67: You snatch it thus, and it is yours for ever.
LINE 68: A mass of things alone the mass secures;
LINE 69: Each comes at last and culls his own from yours.
LINE 70: Bring much, and every one is sure to find,
LINE 71: In your rich nosegay, something to his mind.
LINE 72: You give a piece, give it at once in pieces;
LINE 73: Such a ragout each taste and temper pleases,
LINE 74: And spares, if only they were wise to know it,
LINE 75: Much fruitless toil to player and to poet.
LINE 76: In vain into an artful whole you glue it;
LINE 77: The public in the long run will undo it.
LINE 78: Poet.
LINE 79: What? feel you not the vileness of this trade?
LINE 80: How much the genuine artist ye degrade?
LINE 81: The bungling practice of our hasty school
LINE 82: You raise into a maxim and a rule.
LINE 83: Manager.
LINE 84: All very well!--but when a man
LINE 85: Has forged a scheme, and sketched a plan
LINE 86: He must have sense to use the tool
LINE 87: The best that for the job is fit.
LINE 88: Consider what soft wood you have to split,
LINE 89: And who the people are for whom you write.
LINE 90: One comes to kill a few hours o' the night;
LINE 91: Another, with his drowsy wits oppressed,
LINE 92: An over-sated banquet to digest;
LINE 93: And not a few, whom least of all we choose,
LINE 94: Come to the play from reading the Reviews.
LINE 95: They drift to us as to a masquerade;
LINE 96: Mere curiosity wings their paces;
LINE 97: The ladies show themselves, and show their silks and laces,
LINE 98: And play their parts well, though they are not paid.
LINE 99: What dream you of, on your poetic height?
LINE 100: A crowded house, forsooth, gives you delight!
LINE 101: Look at your patrons as you should,
LINE 102: You'll find them one-half cold, and one-half crude.
LINE 103: One leaves the play to spend the night
LINE 104: Upon a wench's breast in wild delight;
LINE 105: Another sets him down to cards, or calls
LINE 106: For rattling dice, or clicking billiard balls.
LINE 107: For such like hearers, and for ends like these
LINE 108: Why should a bard the gentle Muses tease?
LINE 109: I tell you, give them more, and ever more, and still
LINE 110: A little more, if you would prove your skill.
LINE 111: And since they can't discern the finer quality,
LINE 112: Confound them with broad sweep of triviality--
LINE 113: But what's the matter?--pain or ravishment?
LINE 114: Poet.
LINE 115: If such your service, you must be content
LINE 116: With other servants who will take your pay!
LINE 117: Shall then the bard his noblest right betray?
LINE 118: The right of man, which Nature's gift imparts,
LINE 119: For brainless plaudits basely jest away?
LINE 120: What gives him power to move all hearts,
LINE 121: Each stubborn element to sway,
LINE 122: What but the harmony, his being's inmost tone,
LINE 123: That charms all feelings back into his own?
LINE 124: Where listless Nature, her eternal thread,
LINE 125: The unwilling spindle twists around,
LINE 126: And hostile shocks of things that will not wed
LINE 127: With jarring dissonance resound,
LINE 128: Who guides with living pulse the rhythmic flow
LINE 129: Of powers that make sweet music as they go?
LINE 130: Who consecrates each separate limb and soul
LINE 131: To beat in glorious concert with the whole?
LINE 132: Who makes the surgy-swelling billow
LINE 133: Heave with the wildly heaving breast,
LINE 134: And on the evening's rosy pillow,
LINE 135: Invites the brooding heart to rest?
LINE 136: Who scatters spring's most lovely blooms upon
LINE 137: The path of the belovèd one?
LINE 138: Who plaits the leaves that unregarded grow
LINE 139: Into a crown to deck the honored brow?
LINE 140: Who charms the gods? who makes Olympos yield?
LINE 141: The power of man in poet's art revealed.
LINE 142: Merryfellow.
LINE 143: Then learn such subtle powers to wield,
LINE 144: And on the poet's business enter
LINE 145: As one does on a love-adventure.
LINE 146: They meet by chance, are pleased, and stay
LINE 147: On being pressed, just for a day;
LINE 148: Then hours to hours are sweetly linked in chain,
LINE 149: Till net-caught by degrees, they find retreat is vain.
LINE 150: At first the sky is bright, then darkly lowers;
LINE 151: To-day, fine thrilling rapture wings the hours,
LINE 152: To-morrow, doubts and anguish have their chance,
LINE 153: And, ere one knows, they're deep in a romance.
LINE 154: A play like this both praise and profit brings.
LINE 155: Plunge yourself boldly in the stream of things--
LINE 156: What's lived by all, but known to few--
LINE 157: And bring up something fresh and new,
LINE 158: No matter what; just use your eyes,
LINE 159: And all will praise what all can prize;
LINE 160: Strange motley pictures in a misty mirror,
LINE 161: A spark of truth in a thick cloud of error;
LINE 162: 'Tis thus we brew the genuine beverage,
LINE 163: To edify and to refresh the age.
LINE 164: The bloom of youth in eager expectation,
LINE 165: With gaping ears drinks in your revelation;
LINE 166: Each tender sentimental disposition
LINE 167: Sucks from your art sweet woe-be-gone nutrition;
LINE 168: Each hears a part of what his own heart says,
LINE 169: While over all your quickening sceptre sways.
LINE 170: These younglings follow where you bid them go.
LINE 171: Lightly to laughter stirred, or turned to woe,
LINE 172: They love the show, and with an easy swing,
LINE 173: Follow the lordly wafture of your wing;
LINE 174: Your made-up man looks cold on everything,
LINE 175: But growing minds take in what makes them grow.
LINE 176: Poet.
LINE 177: Then give me back the years again,
LINE 178: When mine own spirit too was growing,
LINE 179: When my whole being was a vein
LINE 180: Of thronging songs within me flowing!
LINE 181: Then slept the world in misty blue,
LINE 182: Each bud the nascent wonder cherished,
LINE 183: And all for me the flowerets grew,
LINE 184: That on each meadow richly flourished.
LINE 185: Though I had nothing then, I had a treasure,
LINE 186: The thirst for truth, and in illusion pleasure.
LINE 187: Give me the free, unshackled pinion,
LINE 188: The height of joy, the depth of pain,
LINE 189: Strong hate, and stronger love's dominion;
LINE 190: O give me back my youth again!
LINE 191: Merryfellow.
LINE 192: The fire of youth, good friend, you need, of course,
LINE 193: Into the hostile ranks to break,
LINE 194: Or, when the loveliest damsels hang by force,
LINE 195: With amorous clinging, from your neck,
LINE 196: When swift your wingèd steps advance
LINE 197: To where the racer's prize invites you,
LINE 198: Or, after hours of whirling dance,
LINE 199: The nightly deep carouse invites you.
LINE 200: But to awake the well-known lyre
LINE 201: With graceful touch that tempers fire,
LINE 202: And to a self-appointed goal,
LINE 203: With tuneful rambling on to roll,
LINE 204: Such are your duties, aged sirs; nor we
LINE 205: Less honor pay for this, nor stint your fee;
LINE 206: Old age, not childish, makes the old; but they
LINE 207: Are genuine children of a mellower day.
LINE 208: Manager.
LINE 209: Enough of words: 'tis time that we
LINE 210: Were come to deeds; while you are spinning
LINE 211: Fine airy phrases, fancy-free,
LINE 212: We might have made some good beginning.
LINE 213: What stuff you talk of being in the vein!
LINE 214: A lazy man is never in the vein.
LINE 215: If once your names are on the poet's roll,
LINE 216: The Muses should be under your control.
LINE 217: You know our want; a good stiff liquor
LINE 218: To make their creeping blood flow quicker;
LINE 219: Then brew the brews without delay;
LINE 220: What was not done to-day, to-morrow
LINE 221: Will leave undone for greater sorrow.
LINE 222: Don't stand, and stare, and block the way,
LINE 223: But with a firm, set purpose lay
LINE 224: Hold of your bright thoughts as they rise to view,
LINE 225: And bid them stay;
LINE 226: Once caught, they will not lightly run away,
LINE 227: Till they have done what in them lies to do.
LINE 228: Among the sons of German play,
LINE 229: Each tries his hand at what he may;
LINE 230: Therefore be brilliant in your scenery,
LINE 231: And spare no cost on your machinery.
LINE 232: Let sun and moon be at your call,
LINE 233: And scatter stars on stars around;
LINE 234: Let water, fire, and rocky wall,
LINE 235: And bird and beast and fish abound.
LINE 236: Thus in your narrow booth mete forth
LINE 237: The wide creation's flaming girth,
LINE 238: And wing your progress, pondered well,
LINE 239: From heaven to earth, from earth to hell.
